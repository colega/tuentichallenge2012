Thunder is a very loud sound that is made sometimes during a very big rain storm Thunder is so loud it can be heard from a very far distance It can sound like a boom a crash or a rumble

Thunder is made when lightning strikes The energy from the lightning heats up the air so much that it makes a kind of explosion

When lightning is very near thunder will be heard soon after the lightning flash and the sound will be very loud If the lightning is farther away the thunder will be a few seconds or many seconds after the lightning People can guess how far away the lightning is by counting the number of seconds between the time they see the lightning and hear the thunder

A man is a male human adult We use the word man to talk about biological sex

Manhood is the time in a mans life after he changes from a boy A boy is a male human child not a female child 

After boys grow we call them a man There are some times we also call a man a boy For example we often use the word boy when talking about adult males who have a partner for example in the word boyfriend Sometimes people also use the word in a bad way for a black man or male slave

There are some sexual differences between a man and a woman Men have sex organs which we call external But many parts of the male reproductive system are internal too The study of male reproduction and sex organs is andrology

Men normally have the same illnesses as women but there are some sexual illnesses which men have only or more often

Biology is not the only thing which makes people feel they are men or that other people are men Perhaps one in 100000 people are men who were born without a male body We call these transgendered or transsexual men Some men can have a hormone or chromosomal difference Some men have other intersex conditions Some of those intersex people who people said were female when they were born later want to change this 

About 20 of males especially babies and children in the USA have had circumcision which changes the male genitalia

There are more differences between men and women not only sexual differences

A woman is a female human adult We use the word woman to talk about biological sex however the term woman is also sometimes used to identify a female human regardless of age as in phrases such as Womens rights

A woman has a uterus or womb It is a counterpart of a human male or man Women give birth to babies Until the 20th century women in most of the world did not have the right to vote and were treated with disrespect The symbol for the goddess Venus is used for women 

In some prehistoric cultures women often had the roles of gathering food and looking after children In modern times these roles have changed a lot with single career oriented women becoming normal in society

To find which is your left hand side point your index fingers and stick your thumbs out at right angles The finger and thumb of your left hand will form a capital letter L

Middle is between up and down and is between left and right Middle means the same as center

Up means the same as above Down means the same as below

Left and right are called opposite sides   

In indoors or inside and out outdoors or outside mean whether one thing is in another most commonly in a house or other building or out in nature   

Far means that something is a long way away Near means close

The Religious Society of Friends is a group of religious people who have joined together because they have similar beliefs People in the Society of Friends are called Friends or Quakers  both mean the same thing The Society is very different from other religious groups The first Quakers were Christians but the religion today includes some other people who are not Christian They live all over the world but the largest groups are in Bolivia Guatemala India Kenya Tanzania the United Kingdom and the United States of America

The Society of Friends began in the 1600s in England A man named George Fox went around preaching his ideas to people including a large group on Pendle Hill He told them they could talk to God themselves  that they did not need a priest or minister to do it for them Many people liked this idea they found it helped them feel close to God Together they started the Society of Friends The government of England did not like this new religion at the time it was against the law not to belong to the Church of England They put a lot of people in jail or made them pay money as a punishment At first the word Quaker was a name used to make fun of people who belonged to the Society of Friends but after a while those people came to like it and use it for themselves

Because Quakers were being thrown in jail in England some of them moved away to places like America A young Quaker named William Penn started a new colony there  he got the land because the English king Charles II owed his father a lot of money This new colony was called Pennsylvania and it was made to be a place where anyone could be free to belong to any religion Penn wanted people to be fair to each other and he called the biggest city in his new colony Philadelphia which means The City of Brotherly Love Soon there were many Quakers in America

The Quakers were very active in America in the Nineteenth century Many of the leaders of the abolition and womens rights movement such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott were Quakers

Today there are about 350000 Quakers in the world This number is very small compared to other religious groups Even so a lot of people have heard of the Quakers because they are good at letting people know what they believe

Quakers worship in meetings for worship and at other times these meetings also decide what Quakers should do  these meetings can be called meetings for business but other people call them meetings for worship for business because they include parts of both worship and business

Anyone can go to a Quaker meeting because most Quakers think that everyone is equal and that this is a very important idea There are two types of Quakers members are definitely part of the Religious Society of Friends and attenders might just be wondering whether Quakerism is right for them In practice both tend to be treated the same

Usually a meeting for worship lasts about an hour It starts with everybody sitting quietly often in a circle This is because they are trying to listen to God Sometimes a Quaker will think that God wants him or her to say something When this happens the person stands up to tell everyone Then they all sit quietly again At some meetings a large number of people will speak At other meetings nobody speaks Quakers believe that a meeting for worship helps them to understand what God wants

At these meetings each Quaker will have a slightly different idea of what it means to them to listen to God and each Quaker will go about doing it in a different way

Quakers also have meetings for worship for weddings and funerals  when two people want to get married or if someone dies When two people get married the meeting is about them and the life that they will have together When someone has died the meeting is about remembering good things about the person and the life they had

Some Quakers in North America South America and Africa have a different kind of meeting They often sing songs or ask a pastor to talk about something interesting They also have quiet times but they do not last as long These Quakers often have strong Christian beliefs

Almost all Quakers share these beliefs

When Quakers say inner light they do not mean that there is really a light bulb inside them They use the phrase inner light to mean something else which they might find difficult to find words to explain Other words that Quakers use to mean similar things include God spirit and love

Quakers think that the truth is very important They believe that it is wrong to make an oath or promise This is because they think people should tell the truth all the time Making a promise shows that they are trying to be more truthful than normal Instead Quakers believe that they should simply say what they are going to do

This is another idea that has caused problems Governments often want people to promise that they will be loyal to the country In a court people have to promise that they will tell the truth Quakers refuse to do these things Several countries now say that Quakers do not have to make oaths but in the past Quakers were put in prison for not making oaths

Today Quakers can sometimes make an affirmation instead The word affirm hints that whatever is being affirmed has already been said or thought This means that they have to say out loud what they are going to do For example in court they might say I affirm that I will tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth Other people would have to say I swear instead of I affirm Many courts ask those testifying if they swear or affirm to tell the truth this covers Quakers as well as non Quakers because people who are not Quakers also believe some of the same things as Quakers

There are two types of people in the Religious Society of Friends  members and attenders Quakers believe that neither is better than the other but there are some differences between the types Quakers who are attenders are part of the Religious Society of Friends they worship with Friends and Quakers like them to be able to do everything that members can do However there are some important jobs  such as the people who look after the meetings money  that Quakers prefer to be done by members

Members have decided that they definitely want to be Quakers and have asked their meeting to make them a member to show that they think that Quakerism is right for them Some people are made members by their parents when they are still babies other people go to Quaker meetings for a while before deciding they want to ask to be a member and some people wait for up to twenty years before asking to be a member

The size of something is how much space the thing takes It can also be described as how big or small something is

Sizes can be measured When a size is measured it is given a number

Small and big are opposites

Opposite means that one thing is completely different from another It might also mean that only one part is different

Opposite also means contrary reverse mirror or on the other side

Direction follows an imaginary line connecting two points Something following the line is moving in that direction People show directions by pointing their index finger towards it

The word direction is made from the root direct meaning to guide

These are words used to talk about a direction

Starvation is when a person or animal has not eaten food for such a time that they are unable to do things in a normal way

After the stomach has been left empty for so long the body starts to give up

The effects of starvation can include

Consistently not being able to eat enough will lead to permanent damage to the organs This is the case for humans when they do not eat enough for about 1 2 months A process called Catabolysis will break down usable resources to keep vital functions

Starvation was also used as a form of sentencing people to death

Microsoft Word is a graphical word processing program that users can type with It is made by the computer company Microsoft The purpose of the MS Word is to allow the users to type and save documents 

Similar to other word processors it has helpful tools to make documents paper Some of the important tools are a spelling grammar checker word count and the newer version includes speech recognition Also like with other programs with this program one can make attractive documents insert pictures in documents make web pages graphs etcAlso you can create tables Also it displays synonyms of words and can read out the text It also can print in different ways

It can be bought at shops and normally comes with Microsoft Office but can be bought separately

The program was first released in 1981 Many of the ideas and features in Microsoft Word came from Bravo the first graphical writing program Microsoft brought the Bravo program and changed its name to Microsoft Word When it first came out it was not very popular and did not sell as well as other writing programs like WordPerfect Although it was not very popular when it came out it had a feature called WYSIWYG which meant that people can change the visual style of writing by clicking on buttons when in other programs like WordPerfect people had to add special codes to change the style of writing WYSIWYG is now a common feature of all computer writing programs

There are versions for Microsoft Word for other operating systems as well as Microsoft Windows but new versions support fewer operating systems although they always support Windows

Note Word for Windows is the name of the of Microsoft Word made for Microsoft Windows

The program is very popular

Although it is sold for money some people download it illegally This is against the copyright of Microsoft and means that Microsoft does not make money from people who illegally download the program but it made the program more popular than if only the people who could buy it used it

That is because if the user did not configure it the program saved the document in a secret file format so other programs could not open it Then if the user who does not configure the program sent his document to a friend the friend needed a copy of Microsoft Word to read the document Then that friend would probably also save documents in the secret format of Word After many years the most important parts of the format were guessed and the format is less secret but Microsoft Word is still popular because many people do not know of other programs or do not want to learn to use them

Ants are social insects of the family Formicidae 

Like wasps and bees ants are in the order Hymenoptera There are about 22000 species of ants More than 12500 have been classified They have a thin waist and elbowed antennae

A colony has a female ant called a queen who lays eggs Those eggs will hatch into worker ants Larger colonies of ants having millions of ants mostly have female ants making groups of workers soldiers or other special castes Almost all ant colonies also have some fertile male ants called drones

Ants have colonies almost everywhere on planet Earth Places that do not have ants are Antarctica and certain far away places or islands hard to live on

Ants are usually small but can carry the weight of twenty ants Usually worker ants will carry food back to the colony so that the other ants and the queen can eat

Some people use ants for food medicine and rituals Some species of ants are used for pest control They can damage crops and enter buildings though Some species like the red imported fire ant live in places where they came to by accident

The family Formicidae belongs to the order Hymenoptera which also includes sawflies bees and wasps Ants evolved from a lineage within the vespoid wasps 

Phylogenetic analysis suggests that ants arose in the mid Cretaceous period about 110 to 130 million years ago After the rise of flowering plants about 100 million years ago they diversified They became ecologically dominant about 60 million years ago 

In 1966 EO Wilson and his colleagues identified the fossil remains of an ant from the Cretaceous period The specimen trapped in amber dating back to more than 80 million years ago has features of both ants and wasps Sphecomyrma was probably a ground forager but some suggest that primitive ants were likely to have been predators underneath the surface of the soil

During the Cretaceous period a few species of primitive ants ranged widely on the Laurasian super continent They were scarce in comparison to other insects representing about 1 of the insect population 

Ants became dominant after adaptive radiation at the beginning of the Cainozoic By the Oligocene and Miocene ants had come to represent 20 40 of all insects found in major fossil deposits Of the species that lived in the Eocene epoch approximately one in ten genera survive to the present Genera surviving today comprise 56 of the genera in Baltic amber fossils and 92 of the genera in Dominican amber fossils

Termites though sometimes called white ants are not ants and belong to the order Isoptera Termites are actually more closely related to cockroaches and mantids Termites are eusocial but differ greatly in the genetics of reproduction The similar social structure is attributed to convergent evolution Velvet ants look like large ants but are wingless female wasps

The life of an ant starts from an egg If the egg is fertilised the progeny will be female if not it will be male Ants develop by complete metamorphosis with the larval stages passing through a pupal stage before emerging as an adult The larva is fed and cared for by workers

Food is given to the larvae by trophallaxis a process in which an ant regurgitates liquid food held in its crop This is also how adults share food stored in the social stomach among themselves 

Larvae may also be given solid food brought back by foraging workers and may even be taken to captured prey in some species The larvae grow through a series of moults and enter the pupal stage 

The differentiation into queens and workers and different castes of workers is influenced in some species by the food the larvae get Genetic influences and the control of gene expression by the feeding are complex The determination of caste is a major subject of research

A new worker spends the first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young It then does digging and other nest work and later defends the nest and forages These changes are sometimes fairly sudden and define what are called temporal castes An explanation for the sequence is suggested by the high casualties involved in foraging making it an acceptable risk only for ants that are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes 

Most ant species have a system in which only the queen and breeding females can mate Contrary to popular belief some ant nests have multiple queens while others can exist without queens Workers with the ability to reproduce are called gamergates and colonies that lack queens are then called gamergate colonies colonies with queens are said to be queen right 

The winged male ants called drones emerge from pupae with the breeding females and do nothing in life except eat and mate 

Most ants produce a new generation each year During the species specific breeding period new reproductives winged males and females leave the colony in what is called a nuptial flight Typically the males take flight before the females Males then use visual cues to find a common mating ground for example a landmark such as a pine tree to which other males in the area converge Males secrete a mating pheromone that females follow Females of some species mate with just one male but in some others they may mate with anywhere from one to ten or more different males Mated females then seek a suitable place to begin a colony There they break off their wings and begin to lay and care for eggs The females store the sperm they obtain during their nuptial flight to selectively fertilise future eggs 

The first workers to hatch are weak and smaller than later workers but they begin to serve the colony immediately They enlarge the nest forage for food and care for the other eggs This is how new colonies start in most species Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site a process akin to swarming in honeybees

A wide range of reproductive strategies have been noted in ant species Females of many species are known to be capable of reproducing asexually through thelytoky and one species Mycocepurus smithii is known to be all female

Ant colonies can be long lived The queens can live for up to 30 years and workers live from 1 to 3 years Males however are more transitory and survive only a few weeks Ant queens are estimated to live 100 times longer than solitary insects of a similar size

Ants are active all year long in the tropics but in cooler regions survive the winter in a state of dormancy or inactivity The forms of inactivity are varied and some temperate species have larvae going into the inactive state while in others the adults alone pass the winter in a state of reduced activity

Scissors are a tool used for cutting thin material like

Knives are better than scissors for some uses Unlike a knife scissors have two sharp edges Some types of scissors like childrens scissors are not very sharp Childrens scissors are often protected with plastic These are called Safety Scissors

Scissors can be made for left handed or right handed people Using scissors made for the wrong hand is very hard for most people 

There are many kinds of scissors used for cutting different materials and shapes

Indigo is one of the colors of the rainbow 

The brightest shade of indigo is the sixth color of the rainbow a hue lying between blue and violet The color shown at right electric indigo is the closest color it is possible to display on a computer to the color of the indigo color band in the rainbow 

Isaac Newton named and defined indigo as a spectrum color when he divided up the spectrum into the seven colors of the rainbow

The name of the color indigo originally came from the indigo plant Indigo is a dye made from the indigo plant used to dye cloth Indigo dye also is used to dye denim cloth which is used to make what are called blue jeans This shade of indigo called indigo dye is darker than the spectrum indigo shown above

The indigo plant originally came from the nation of India The Ancient Greek language word for the dye is indikon The Romans used the term indicum which passed into Italian dialect and eventually into English as the word indigo 

These things are colored indigo

Note The spectrum colors can only be approximated on a computer screen but the colors shown below are a close approximation of the spectrum colors blue indigo and violet

Henry and his wife had two children Matilda and William Adelin He also fathered more illegitimate children than any other English King Guesses place the number between 20 and 25

Henry died in 1135 while visiting his daughter and grandchildren in Normandy After his death his daughter Mathilda and his nephew Stephen argued over who would become the ruler of England and started a civil war

William I of England also known as William the Conqueror was King of England from 1066 until 1087

William was born in Falaise which is in Normandy France He became Duke of Normandy in 1047 when he a won a battle at Caen

William married his cousin Matilda of Flanders in either 1050 or 1051

William became the King of England after he invaded England and won the Battle of Hastings in 1066 against King Harold The Normans became the Anglo Saxons kings and lords but the common people remained the same

After he became King of England William had his servants write the Domesday Book which listed all the land in his new kingdom who owned it and how much it was worth It was finished in 1086

William died when he was in Rouen France from injuries he had received from falling off a horse He was succeeded by his son William II of England

Saint Denis Basilica is famous for its architecture and as the burial place for many Kings of France It is in the suburb of Saint Denis which is in the north of Paris France

The Basilica is named after Saint Denis Saint Denis is the patron saint of France He was also the first Bishop of Paris

The Basilica was a Romanesque building In 1136 the Abbot Suger began replacing the building bit by bit beginning with the west front and then with a new east end The east end is said to be the first building in the Gothic style It was not completed until the 13th century

Gothic architecture is a style of architecture used in Western Europe in the Middle Ages It began in France in the 12th century after Romanesque architecture It lasted into the 16th century when Renaissance architecture became popular  Its important features are the pointed arch the ribbed vault and the flying buttress which are explained below 

Gothic architecture is best known as the style of many of the great cathedrals abbeys and churches of Europe It is also the architecture of many castles palaces town halls universities and also some houses

Many church buildings still remain from this period Even the smallest Gothic churches are often very beautiful while many of the larger churches and cathedrals are thought to be priceless works of art Many are listed with the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization as World Heritage Sites

In the 19th century the Gothic style became popular again particularly for building churches and universities This style is called Gothic Revival architecture

Gothic architecture was at first called the French Style The word Gothic was used later during the Renaissance as an insult In fact the architecture had nothing to do with the real Goths a tribe of people who attacked Rome in the early Middle Ages

An Italian writer named Giorgio Vasari used the word Gothic in the 1530s because he thought buildings from the Middle Ages were not carefully planned and measured like Renaissance buildings or the buildings of ancient Rome After Vasari many other people used the word Gothic to describe architecture with pointed arches

At the end of the 12th century Western Europe was split into different states A big part of Europe was called the Holy Roman Empire The Holy Roman Empire included the modern countries of Germany The Netherlands Belgium Luxembourg Switzerland Austria eastern France and much of northern Italy apart from Venice People believed the Emperor Charlemagne started the Holy Roman Empire in 800 AD

The countries of France and Spain were split into kingdoms England was ruled by a king whose family also had a lot of land in France Norway was influenced by England while the other Scandinavian countries and Poland were influenced by Germany

At that time there was a lot of trade between towns and states This caused the towns to grow larger Germany Holland and Belgium had many big towns that grew peacefully often trading with each other Because of the peace and wealth of these towns they showed their pride by building huge Town Halls often with very tall towers

In England and France most people did not live in towns They lived on farms which were often owned by a rich nobleman The house of the lord was usually called a Manor house This form of economy is known as Manorialism Italy was mostly split up into small city states which often fought each other Cities often had high walls and many of the houses built at this time were tall high towers

In Western Europe in the Middle Ages almost everyone belonged to the Roman Catholic Church The Roman Catholic Church has one head  the Pope During the Middle Ages one language was used in churches all across Europe  Church Latin which had developed from ancient Latin The churches of each area had a local ruler who came under the Pope This was the Bishop Each Bishop had a throne where he could sit when priests and people came to him A church which has a Bishops throne is called a cathedral Cathedrals were usually the biggest and most beautiful churches

In the early Middle Ages many monasteries were built all over Europe A monastery was a group of buildings where holy men lived and worked and prayed Monks belonged to different orders which had different rules The biggest number of monasteries were homes to the monks of the Benedictine Order Their monasteries were generally in towns and they often built very big churches called Abbeys for the monks and the townspeople to worship in Other orders of monks like the Cistercians did not live near towns Nowadays their abbeys are seen as beautiful ruins in the English countryside

In France there were also Benedictines as well as Cluniac and Cistercian Orders The great monastery at Cluny built in the Romanesque style was the biggest in Europe The abbey and other buildings were very well planned so for hundreds of years other monasteries were influenced by that plan

In the 13th century St Francis of Assisi started the Franciscans who were often called the Grey Friars because of their grey brown robes From them came the Dominicans founded by St Dominic in Toulouse and Bologna The Dominicans built a large number of Italys Gothic churches

Abbot Suger was the head of a large monastery just north of Paris in France The monastery had a large church the Abbey of Saint Denis and also a royal palace where the French kings sometimes stayed Abbot Suger was a close friend to two kings Louis VI and Louis VII

In 1127 Suger had the idea to rebuild the great abbey Church of Saint Denis He began by changing the West Front or facade which was about 200 years old and had only one small door Sugers grand design had three big doors like the arches on the Arch of Constantine in Rome which were to let in all the crowds on special Holy Days The facade also had a big round window in the centre called a rose window which was the first one in France

Abbot Suger did not then rebuild the part of the church inside the west doors the nave where most of the ordinary people stood The next part that he rebuilt was the eastern end

Abbot Suger wanted this part to make people think of Heaven He wanted it to be very light and bright with great big windows of beautifully coloured glass To do this he looked at all the most modern designs and all the clever things that other architects had done He put all the new ideas together in one building It was the first building of the new Gothic style

The new East End was dedicated or given to God on June 11 1144 Other architects soon copied the design for other big churches and cathedrals in northern France After Abbot Sugers death the rest of the church was also rebuilt in the new style and got two more much larger and more decorated rose windows one on either side

The style soon spread to England and through France the Low Countries Germany Spain and northern of Italy and Sicily

Romanesque was the style of architecture in Europe before the Gothic style Gothic architecture grew out of Romanesque architecture There was not a clean break between the two styles Many of the features of Gothic architecture did not begin in the Gothic period They were already there is Romanesque architecture and slowly changed to become Gothic The main changes were the pointed arch and the flying buttress These two developments allowed many other changes to happen 

Romanesque buildings had thick walls small windows round arches and flat buttresses Gothic buildings had thinner walls larger windows pointed arches and large buttresses 

All the types of buildings and the general shape of the buildings were already there in the Romanesque period The types of buildings were the cathedral church the parish church the monastery the castle the palace the great hall and the gatehouse

Before the 20th century the landmark building in almost every town was a church cathedral abbey or town hall with its tall tower or spire rising high above all the houses Many of these buildings were from the Middle Ages and were Romanesque or Gothic in style 

The groundplan of most Gothic churches is shaped like a cross The long nave makes the body of the church and crossing it the arms are called the transept On the other side of the transept is the chancel which is often called the choir because that is where the priest and the choir sing the services

The nave usually has a passageway or aisle on either side Sometimes there are two aisles on each side The nave is usually a lot taller than the aisles and has high windows which light up the central space The upper part of the building where these windows are is called the clerestory

Some Gothic churches in Germany and Austria and also Milan Cathedral often have nave and aisles of almost the same height and are called hallenkirke The Cathedral of St Stephen of Vienna is an example

In some churches with double aisles like Notre Dame Paris the transept does not stick out beyond the aisles In English cathedrals the transepts always stick out a long way and sometimes there are two transepts as at Salisbury Cathedral

It is at the eastern end that Gothic churches are the most different from each other

In England the eastern end it is usually long and often has two parts It is usually square or has a Lady Chapel a place to pray to the Virgin Mary the mother of Jesus

In France the eastern end is often polygonal and has by a passage for walking called an ambulatory Often French churches have a ring of chapels called a chevette German churches are often like those of France at the eastern end

In Italy there is no long chancel jutting out beyond the transept There is usually just a semicircular chapel as at Florence Cathedral

The facade or West Front of a large church or cathedral is designed to make a big impression on the worshippers One of the best known is Notre Dame de Paris

In the centre of the facade is the main door or portal often with two side doors as well In the arch of the middle door is often an important piece of sculpture usually Christ in Majesty Sometimes there is a stone post in the middle of the doorway where there is a statue of the Madonna and Child There are many other carved figures in niches set all around the portals Sometimes there are hundreds of stone figures carved all across the front of the building

Above the middle door there is a large window which is usually a rose window like that at Reims Cathedral but not in England Scotland Belgium or Scandinavia where there will nearly always be a very large pointed window to let in lots of light

In Italy the facade is often decorated with coloured marble and mosaic made of little coloured tiles and not so many statues as at Orvieto Cathedral

The facade of a French cathedral and many English Spanish and German cathedrals usually has two towers

Large Gothic churches and cathedrals are often very tall On the inside the nave is usually at least twice as high as it is wide which gives the church a very tall narrow look Some of the churches in France and Germany have naves that are three times as high as they are wide Cologne Cathedral is an example The tallest nave is at Beauvais Cathedral which is 1575 feet high Westminster Abbey is 102 feet high

On the outside most Gothic churches both big and small have at least one tower In Italy there are domes on the churches and the tower stands to one side But in most other countries cathedrals generally have two towers and quite often have three Some have even more Laon Cathedral was planned to have seven but they were not all built

Sometimes there is just one tower with a huge spire as at Salisbury Lincoln Cathedral had the tallest spire of the Middle Ages at 527 feet

Because a pointed arch points upwards it makes people look upwards In Gothic architecture the whole building is designed to make people look up There are long narrow columns long narrow windows and high pointed roofs On the inside the arches of the roof rise up like branches On the outside there are often lots of fancy bits along the edge of the roof and on the tops of buttresses and above the windows These are called pinnacles Milan Cathedral has hundreds of them

 ImageSalisbury Cathedral exteriorjpgSalisbury Cathedral England has the tallest spire of the 1300s ImageUppsala CathedraljpgUppsala Cathedral Sweden Only few churches still have three spires like this ImageFialen Mailaender DomjpgPinnacles on Milan cathedral ImageBeauvais voute10jpgBeauvais Cathedral has the highest Gothic vault in the world 

Gothic architecture usually has a lot of windows Sainte Chapelle is a famous example At Gloucester Cathedral in England the East window is as big as a tennis court Milan Cathedral also has windows of about the same size

The flying buttresses which arch across the roof of the aisle were used to support the roof above the windows so the walls did not have to be so thick

The columns of the inside the ribs of the vault and the flying buttresses made a strong stone skeleton in between these parts the walls and the filling of the vaults could be of lighter thinner material Between the narrow buttresses the walls could be opened up into large windows

Through the Gothic period because of the pointed arch Gothic windows were able to change from simple openings to very rich designs The windows were very often filled with stained glass which made coloured light in the building and was used for story telling pictures

 ImageSt omer cathedrale 032005jpgThe clerestorey windows and buttresses at Saint Omer Cathedral from the outside ImageNef Reims triforiumjpgThe clerestory windows at Reims from the inside The flying buttresses mean there is no need for thick walls to hold the vault up ImageChartres2006 046jpgThe windows at Chartres Cathedral are famous for their ancient stained glass ImageSainte chapelle  Upper leveljpgSainte Chapelle is a Chapel built for a French King 

Pointed arches were used in Persian architecture and from 641 AD onwards they were a feature of Islamic architecture Knowledge of the pointed arch spread into Europe through the Crusaders who travelled to the Middle East from 1096 onwards Also Islamic forces had taken over parts of Spain where they built cities and Mosques with pointed arches

Architectural historians think that the pointed arch was also used by some European architects because it was a very strong way of making an arch

In Gothic Architecture the pointed arch is used in every place where an arch is needed both for strength and for decoration Gothic openings such as doorways windows arcades and galleries have pointed arches A row of arches is called an arcade A row of arches that is up high on a building is a gallery

Rows of pointed arches were used to decorate walls This is known as blind arcading Often walls were made with tall narrow arched openings in them that could be used to stand statues in An opening like this is called a niche which is pronounced neesh

An arched roof built of bricks or stone is called a vault In the Romanesque period before the Gothic some churches had vaulted roofs They were always based on perfectly semi circular shapes There were two main ways to make a nave vault in the Romanesque period A vault could be long like a tunnel Churches with this type of vault were always rather dark Or it could be square like two tunnels crossing each other This meant that the columns that carried the vault always had to be placed on a perfectly square ground plan which was not always possible

One of the good things about pointed arches was that they could be narrow and tall or flattened and wide Using pointed arches architects could make vaults of very different shapes They did not even have to be rectangular A Gothic architect could make a vault with one side narrow two sides wide and the last side even wider They could make a vault with three sides or five sides quite easily by using pointed arches

The vaults were made of ribs which met each other at the highest part of the vault In between the ribs were sloping surfaces of stone or brick that could be much thinner and lighter than the ribs At first the pattern made by the ribs was quite plain like Romanesque vaults but architects particularly in England soon started adding small ribs in between the main ones and making different patterns Some vaults like this can also be seen in Spain and Germany but not usually in France or Italy

 ImageSanta Chiara Assisi4jpgA simple ribbed arch decorated with fresco in Italy ImageExeter cathedralJPGThe vault at Exeter Cathedral has many ribs It is the longest Gothic vault in the world ImageBovedas plasenciaJPGThis vault in Spain has many small curved ribs in between the supporting ones to make a rich pattern ImageKings College Chapel  fan vaulted ceiling  Cambridge  UK  2007jpgFan vaulting like this at Kings College Chapel is only found in England 

In the Gothic period the shape and style of pointed arches changed But the changes were not the same in every country

With pointed arches windows could be made very large Architects made many designs of pointed arches crossing each other in different ways These designs were often used in windows which look as if they are filled with beautiful stone lace This is called tracery The stone tracery was used to hold the glass in place An Architectural Historian can often tell just how old a part of a building is by looking at the window tracery design

The simplest Gothic arch is a long opening with a pointed arch known in England as the lancet A lancet is a sharp knife so these windows are knife shaped Very often lancet windows are put together in a group of three or five

Salisbury Cathedral is famous for the beauty of its Lancet Gothic Architecture In England the style is called Early English Gothic York Cathedral in England has a group of five lancet windows that are 50 feet high and are still full of ancient glass They are called the Five Sisters

These simple windows are also found at Chartres Cathedral and Laon Cathedral in France They are the most usual sort of Gothic windows in Italy

Many Gothic openings have tops that are based upon an equilateral triangle The Equilateral Arch has a very pleasing look and gives a wide opening useful for doorways arcades and big windows

These arches are often filled with tracery in circular designs In England this style is called Geometric Decorated Gothic It can be seen at many English and French Cathedrals for example Lincoln cathedral in England and Notre Dame in Paris

Some Gothic windows have designs in the tracery or even in the top of the window itself that rises up like a flame This is called Flamboyant Gothic Tracery like this makes a very rich and lively effect

Some of the most beautiful and famous windows of Europe have this type of tracery It can be seen at St Stephens Vienna Sainte Chapelle in Paris at the Cathedrals of Limoges and Rouen in France and at Milan Cathedral in Italy In England the most famous windows like this are the West Window of York Minster with its design based on the Sacred Heart the East Window at Carlisle Cathedral and the East window of Selby Abbey Architectural Historians sometimes argue about which of these is the most beautiful

Flame shaped arches are not as strong as ordinary pointed arches It is never used for making a vaulted roof If this shape is used to make a doorway there is generally another stronger arch around it Another way is to make a square topped door that has Flamboyant decoration over the top In France there are many doorways both in churches and in houses that are like this They are rare in England but there is one at Rochester Cathedral

In England the Flamboyant style was used wall arcading and niches The most famous examples in are in the Lady Chapel at Ely the Screen at Lincoln and the facade of Exeter Cathedral In German and Spanish Gothic architecture the Flamboyant style is often used for opnwork stone screens The famous pulpit in Vienna Cathedral is made like this

The Depressed arch is wide and looks as if it has been pushed almost flat When arches like this are used to make great big windows they need to be supported by many tall thin vertical shafts and horizontal transoms so that the window looks as if it has been divided up into a grid This sort of decoration is used one walls as well In England the style is called Perpendicular Gothic style

At Gloucester Cathedral the Perpendicular East Window is said to be as large as a tennis court There are three very famous large chapels in this style Kings College Chapel Cambridge St Georges Chapel at Windsor Castle Henry VIIs Chapel at Westminster Abbey The other famous example is Bath Abbey ImageYorkMinsterMain Summer2006JPGThe south transept facade at York Minster has lancet windows ImageYorkMinsterChapterHousejpgThe windows in the Chapter House at York Minster have equilateral arches filled with Geometric tracery ImageLimoges curvilinear traceryJPGThe windows at Limoges Cathedral in France have Flamboyant tracery ImageFchergewlbe KingsCollegejpgThe vault at Kings College Chapel England has depressed arches and fan vaulting 

A Gothic cathedral was designed to be like a model of the universe Everything about the building was designed to tell a message about God

The statues the decoration stained glass windows and wall paintings told Bible stories such as how God created the world and how he rules over everything that is in the universe the seasons of the year and the stars in the sky

Carvings near the door often show the signs of the Zodiac because the patterns of stars in the sky were very important to farming people who did not have calendars to tell them when to plant and when to harvest

Above the main door is often a sculpture of Jesus on a throne judging the people of the Earth Many pictures and sculptures are there to remind people to live good lives because they never know what will happen next

Many churches were very richly decorated both inside and out the statues were often painted in bright colours but nowadays only tiny bits remain at Chartres cathedral and some other places Wooden ceilings were usually brightly coloured Sometimes the stone columns were painted as well

Even though some things about Gothic architecture stay the same other things look different in different countries

Different building materials were found in different parts of Europe This is one of the differences in the architecture between different places In France there was limestone It was good for building because it was soft to cut but got much harder when the air and rain got on it It was usually a pale grey colour France also had beautiful white limestone from Caen which was perfect for making very fine carvings

England had coarse limestone red sandstone and dark green Purbeck marble which was often used for architectural decorations like thin columns

In Northern Germany Netherlands Denmark Baltic countries and northern Poland there was no good building stone but there was clay for making bricks and tiles So many of these countries have Brick Gothic churches and even Brick Gothic castles

In Italy limestone was used for city walls and castles but brick was used for other buildings Because Italy had lots of beautiful marble in many different colours many buildings have fronts or facades decorated in coloured marble Some churches have very rough brick facades because the marble was never put on Florence Cathedral for example did not get its marble facade until the 1800s

In some parts of Europe there were many tall straight trees that were good for making very large roofs But in England by the 1400s the long straight trees were running out Many of the trees were used for building ships The architects had to think of a new way to make a wide roof from short pieces of timber That is how they invented the hammer beam roofs which are one of the beautiful features seen in many old English churches

French cathedrals and those in Germany and Belgium are often very high both inside and outside The transepts do not stick out far The facades in France nearly always have three doors a rose window and two towers There are often facades with doors on the transepts as well as the front 

The thing that makes English cathedrals different from the others is that they are long and look horizontal like big ocean liners English cathedrals nearly all took hundreds of years to build and every part is in a style that is quite different to the next part The West window is very large and is never a rose window The west front may have two towers like a French Cathedral or none There is nearly always a tower at the middle of the building which may have a big spire 

In Germany the towers and spires are often enormously large Sometimes they are so big that it was impossible to finish them until modern times The spires are quite different to English spires because they are made of lacy openwork There are also many hallenkirke which have no clerestorey windows The nave and the aisles are about the same height

Like an English Cathedral a Spanish or Portuguese Gothic Cathedral is often built in many different styles They are often wide Spanish cathedrals often have chapels all around them The roof often has many different types of towers and spires Often the central towers are polygonal 

Italian Gothic cathedrals use lots of colour both outside and inside On the outside the facade is often decorated with marble On the inside the walls are often painted plaster The columns and arches are often decorated with bright coloured paint There are also mosaics with gold backgrounds and beautifully tiled floors is geometric patterns The facades often have an open porch with a wheel windows above it There is often a dome at the centre of the building The bell tower is hardly ever attached to the building because Italy has quite a few earthquakes The windows are not as large as in northern Europe and although stained glass windows are often found the favorite way of decorating the churches is fresco ImageCathedraledeCoutancesbordercroppedjpgCoutances Cathedral in France looks vertical ImageInterieur cathedrale de wellsJPGWells Cathedral in England looks horizontal ImageRegensburger Dom 1jpgRegensburg Cathedral in Germany looks as if there it lots of space inside ImageIMGP0204  Winchester Cathedral  20050322jpgWinchester Cathedral in England is very long ImageBarcelona catedrale vista interno ajpgBarcelona Cathedral in Spain is very wide ImageStMariadelFiore inner ajpgFlorence Cathedral in Italy is colourful with brown stone columns and plaster walls painted pinkish orange ImageInterno duomo Orvieto jpgOrvieto Cathedral in Italy has round striped columns and an open wooden roof ImageBad Doberan Mnster 2006 09 24JPGBad Doberan Minster in Germany is in colourful brick 

A cathedral is a large Christian church It is the seat of a Bishop Only those Christian denominations that have bishops have cathedrals Cathedrals can be found in the Roman Catholic Eastern Orthodox Oriental Orthodox Anclican as well as some Lutheran churches As cathedrals are the seat of a bishop they are central church of a diocese 

In the Greek Orthodox Church the terms kathedrikos naos and metropolis are both used to describe the same thing Metropolis is more common but both terms are officially used

There are certain variations on the use of the term cathedral for example some pre Reformation cathedrals in Scotland now within the Church of Scotland still retain the term cathedral despite the Churchs Presbyterian polity which does not have bishops As cathedrals are often particularly impressive buildings the term is often used incorrectly to refer to any large important church 

Several cathedrals in Europe such as Strasbourg and in England at York Lincoln and Southwell are referred to as Minster churches from Latin monasterium because the establishments were served by canons living in community or may have been an abbey prior to the Reformation The other kind of great church in Western Europe is the abbey 

The word cathedral is derived from the Latin noun cathedra and refers to the presence of the bishops or archbishops chair or throne In the ancient world the chair was the symbol of a teacher and thus of the bishops role as teacher and also of an official presiding as a magistrate and thus of the bishops role in governing a diocese

The word cathedral though now grammatically used as a noun is originally the adjective in the phrase cathedral church from the Latin ecclesia cathedralis The seat marks the place set aside in the prominent church of the diocese for the head of that diocese and is therefore a major symbol of authority

Many cathedrals are very old

A patron saint is someone who has broken wikt linkdevotiondevoted their whole life to something greater than themselves They are someone who worked hard to make the world a better place Catholics traditionally take a name of a patron saint to help them throughout their life

Here is a list of patron saints and the things that they are the patron saint of

Saint David is the patron saint of Wales He was a Welsh bishop in the 6th century

Saint George is the patron saint of England

According to a legend Saint George of Lydda killed a dragon and saved the lives of many people It is sometimes called The Golden Legend It is a legend that is older than Christianity which some people believe is based on gods from different religions such as Sabazios

A city called Silene had a large lake where a plague bearing dragon who breathed fire and disease lived The dragon poisoned all the countryside To please the dragon the people of Silene gave it a sheep every day for food and when there were no more sheep they gave their children to the dragon The children were chosen by a lottery

One year the lottery chose the Kings daughter The King sad and desperate asked the people to take all his gold and silver and half of his empire  but only if his daughter could be saved The people refused The daughter was sent out to the lake dressed in white as a bride to be a fine meal for the dragon

Not knowing this Saint George was riding past the lake on the same day The princess terrified and trembling tried to send him away but George said he would stay and protect her

The dragon came suddenly out of the lake while they were speaking Saint George made a gesture called the Sign of the Cross jumped on his horse and advanced toward the dragon He used his long spear to hurt the dragon badly Then he asked the princess to throw her long pretty belt to him He put the silk belt around the dragons neck Now the dragon followed the girl like a humble pet follows its master 

The Princess and Saint George took the dragon back to the city of Silene where the people were terrified to see the dragon enter But Saint George told them not to be scared He said that if the people became Christians and went to Church to be baptized he would kill the dragon immediately

The king and the people of Silene converted to Christianity George killed the dragon with his sword Ascalon and its body was taken out of the city on carts Fifteen thousand men were baptized not counting women and children On the site where the dragon died the king built a Church for the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint George From the altar in the church came a fountain of holy water The water cured any disease

The story of Saint George and the Dragon symbolizes when good wins over evil and is very famous It might be based on the Greek legend of Perseus and Andromeda It is the subject of a lot of art through many centuries In Sweden the Princess symbolizes the nation of Sweden and the dragon represents a foreign army of enemies The story was passed from parent to child through songs in Russia It was also made into the story The Reluctant Dragon by Kenneth Ransome which was made into a Disney film

Saint Georges Day is on April 23rd although this is not a holiday in the UK He is the patron saint of many other countries too  including Greece Palestine Georgia Portugal and Russia Moscow Russia has 41 Churches with the name of Saint George and the Moscow city Coat of Arms or symbol is of Saint George on a horse killing the dragon Saint George is the patron saint of the Boy Scouts of America

On St Georges day some people in England wear a red rose or put an English flag in their window The flag of England is white with a red cross The design of the flag is often called The Saint George Cross or The Colors of Saint George

Saint Andrew is one of the twelve apostles of Jesus and the patron saint of Scotland He was crucified on a cross that was turned sideways to look like an X The Saint Andrews flag is the official flag of Scotland On St Andrews Day many people in Scotland wear a thistle

The following people were the twelve apostles of Jesus 

Saint Patrick c 402  March 17 year unknown is the patron saint of Ireland and Nigeria He was born in a village in Wales 

When he was 16 years old he was captured and sold into slavery He also married couples when the king prohibited it

Saint Patrick came from a Christian family He was the son of Calpornius who was a deacon He brought Christianity to Ireland He converted many pagans to Christianity He also challenged many of their leaders and druids such as Aodhan the Brave also known as Chief Aodhan StPatrick eventually converted Chief Aodhan and they worked together to convert many other pagans 

St Patricks Day is celebrated every year on March 17 in his honour

There is a bell in the National Museum of Ireland that was made around the time of Saint Patricks life There is no evidence that Saint Patrick owned the bell but the Irish have believed the bell belonged to Saint Patrick for 1400 years One of the kings of Ulster who was the high king of Ireland at the time had a beautiful cover made out of gold and gems to preserve the bell The names of the bishops of Ireland were engraved on the cover The style of the letters on the cover were used to make the first typewriters It is believed that the bell was rung by Saint Patrick to let people know it was time for church

There are no snakes in Ireland but there is a legend that at the time of Saint Patrick there were lots of snakes and he chased them all into the Irish Sea

  

March 17 is the 76th day of the year in the Gregorian calendar There are 289 days remaining

Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg was a German metal worker and inventor He is famous for his work in printing in the 1450s and is specifically known for inventing typography

Gutenberg was born in Mainz the son of a merchant Friele Gensfleisch zur Laden Gutenbergs father took the surname zum Gutenberg after the name of the place they now lived

Gutenberg invented a sort of metal for printing inks a way to fix type very accurately and a new sort of printing press He took the idea for his printing press from the presses wine makers used Many people say Gutenberg invented printing with moveable type but it was already invented in China before that see printing 

Before movable type people used block printing where the printer prints a whole page from one piece of metal or wood With movable type the printer makes a letter from a piece of metal or wood and can use it again and again in different words Together all Gutenbergs inventions made printing fast In Renaissance Europe there was an information explosion  in a short time people printed a lot of new books

The high number of new books was partly because of the popular Bible Gutenberg printed the Gutenberg Bible This was the first Bible people made in large numbers Gutenberg started on 23 February 1455 Gutenberg was not a clever businessman and did not get much money from his system He had legal problems and lost his machines to his partner Johann Fust The Archbishop at the time sympathized with Gutenberg because of his contributions to society so told him that he would receive a pension each year with clothes wine and grain Gutenberg died in Mainz Germany in 1468

In his lifetime Gutenberg was not successful but his invention was very important In a short time news and books were travelling around Europe very fast Scientists could communicate better and it helped the development of science and technology More people learned to read 

Today there are still 60 Gutenberg Bibles They are probably the oldest books that printers made with moveable type

The Gutenberg Galaxy and Project Gutenberg use Gutenbergs name The city of Guttenberg Iowa in the United States is named after him

Elizabeth I of England was the Queen of England and Ireland and nominal claimant to Queen of France from 17 November 1558 until she died in 1603 She has also been called The Virgin Queen or Good Queen Bess

Elizabeth was born in the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich England She was the daughter of King Henry VIII of England and his second wife Anne Boleyn When she was very young she lost her right to be called a princess because her mother was found guilty of having lovers and was executed After Annes death the king said she should no longer be treated as his daughter Her half sister Mary was in the same position Mary was much older than Elizabeth but her mother had been divorced by King Henry and she was also being treated as if she was not the Kings daughter

After Anne Boleyn died King Henry married Jane Seymour who became queen Jane had a baby son who was named Edward Men were thought to make better rulers than women so Edward became heir to the throne as soon as he was born People thought he was an OK King but he was young and did not understand how to solve some things He always had an adviser ready to give advice He died because he fell ill 

Elizabeth was taken away from the royal court and was looked after by other people She was given a good education Elizabeth could speak and read six languages her native English as well as French Italian Spanish Greek and Latin

When she was thirteen years old King Henry died Elizabeths younger half brother Edward became King even though he was only a child He was called King Edward VI of England Because King Henry had no other children he left a will saying that if Edward had no children of his own Mary would be queen after him and Elizabeth would be queen after Mary At the time no one thought this would ever happen but Edward died when he was only fifteen Mary then became queen and was called Queen Mary I of England

During Marys reign life became difficult for Elizabeth When King Henry VIII divorced Marys mother he had quarrelled with the Pope and most people in England had turned away from the Roman Catholic religion Mary had been loyal to the old religion and as soon as she became queen she married King Philip II of Spain who was a Roman Catholic This marriage made her unpopular because Spain and England were old enemies Mary wanted everyone else in England to be Roman Catholic again so she tried to make Elizabeth attend Roman Catholic services Elizabeth pretended to believe the same as Mary but she was not really a Catholic Because of the argument over religion many people in the country preferred Elizabeth to Mary and wanted to make her queen She was accused of trying to take Marys throne and was even put into the Tower of London for a while

Elizabeth became the Queen of England in 1558 after Elizabeth has been called the Virgin Queen because she never married The English loved Elizabeth because she courted them but they wanted her to marry and give them a king and heirs Because Elizabeth was a woman many people believed that she would do whatever her husband told her Marys marriage to Philip of Spain had caused a lot of problems and Elizabeth did not want to make the same mistake in marrying a foreign ruler If she married one person she would form an alliance with one country but could make many enemies Politics would become uneasy and England would be opposed by other countries She played the political games with the prospect of marrying one prince or anotheraligning England with one side of a power struggle or the other  perhaps a country seeking to assert itself into the world politics would win her hand If Elizabeth had married it is likely England would have been attacked by one or both of the major powers at the time  Spain or France By keeping suitors on their toes she delayed such an invasion for many years She was fond of saying England was her husband

If Elizabeth had married a man who was not a prince or king that might also have caused problems because other people would have been jealous of her husband Most people believe that she was in love with Robert Dudley the 1st Earl of Leicester She renewed her friendship with Robert Dudley when they were both prisoners in the Tower of London during Queen Marys reign Elizabeth knew about Robert Dudleys marriage to a woman called Amy Robsart as she had attended their wedding After Elizabeth became queen there was gossip about her friendship with Robert Dudley Not long afterwards Amy died in an accident It seems that she fell down stairs after sending all her servants away her body was not found until later Some people said that her husband had arranged for her to be killed so he would be free to marry Queen Elizabethsome think she committed suicide because of her husbands attention on the queen All this gossip made it impossible for Elizabeth to marry him When Elizabeth found she could not marry the man she loved she may have decided that she would not marry at all

Elizabeth I caught smallpox in 1562 This scared Parliament because they did not know who would be the King or Queen after her They asked Elizabeth I to name an heir but she did not

The person with the most legitimate claim to follow Elizabeth to the throne of England was her cousin Mary Stuart who was already Queen of Scotland Mary Stuart and Elizabeth were rivals Mary was a Catholic and Elizabeth was a Protestant Mary married a French prince and became the French queen was well as the Queen of Scots Some people wanted to force Elizabeth off the throne and replace her with Mary This made Mary a danger to Elizabeths bid for power

Because many Scottish people were Protestants they did not like Mary and wanted to get rid of her She was put in prison and her infant son James was made King of Scotland in her place He became James VI In 1568 she escaped and ran away to England to ask for help from Elizabeth Elizabeth kept her as a prisoner for many years In 1578 Elizabeth was told that Mary had been plotting to kill her and become queen in her place Mary was put on trial and found guilty and Elizabeth agreed to put Mary to death This action was popular with Elizabeths court but it made her enemies in the Catholic countries of Europe such as France and Spain

After the death of her friend Robert Dudley Elizabeth was very upset and turned to Dudleys stepson the Earl of Essex who was a young man and not always very sensible He let Elizabeth down several times In the end she sent him away from the royal court Essex behaved very stupidly by getting a gang of his friends together and trying to take over the country Not many people supported them and they were all executed Elizabeth was very hurt by the way he had behaved and she was even more upset at having to agree to his execution

Elizabeth I fell ill in February 1603 she was suffering from physical weakness and insomnia She had no children so it was decided that James VI would be the next king of England James VI was the son of Mary Stuart but he was a Protestant Elizabeth I died at the age of 69 on 24 March 1603 She had managed to keep peace in the country and to keep the independence of England These were thought to be great achievements

There have been many films about Elizabeth I

God Save the Queen is a song the national anthem of the United Kingdom When there is a king instead of a queen it becomes God Save the King Some other countries that still have the British monarch as their head of state use this song as a Royal Anthem to honour the queen

It is not completely certain who wrote it but most people think it was Dr Henry Carey who first performed it in 1740

The tune for God Save the Queen was used in many countries as a national anthem Apart from the German state many of which were linked to Great Britain by marriage Liechtenstein and Switzerland used the tune Switzerland changed to a different tune in the 1960s Liechtenstein still uses the tune

The tune is both American and British In the 1930s the United States chose an official anthem The Star Spangled Banner was chosen instead of the equally popular My Country tis of Thee which used the God Save the Queen tune

The lion is a large mammal of the Felidae family and is often called the king of the jungle Lions are mostly found in Africa and in a small reserve in India They can live in cool areas very hot areas or in thick forests In the past there were wild lions in Europe Today many live in zoos around the world In the past they have lived in Northern India Pakistan and Arabia Lions are also used as symbols representing courage They appear in heraldry more often than any other animal They are considered the king of beasts and the icon of courage and royalty

Lions live for 10 to 14 years when they are in the wild When they are captured they can live longer than 20 years In the wild males do not usually live longer than 10 years This is because wounds from fighting with other males make their lives shorter They usually live in savanna and grassland though they sometimes live in bushes and forests Compared to other cats lions are very social A group of lions is called a pride In a pride of lions there are related females their young and a small number of adult males Groups of female lions often hunt together

The lion is the second largest member of the cat family that lives in Africa It hunts many animals and humans for example gnus and antelopes and eats a lot of meat it also uses gears and complicated machinery to get papaya fruit as an alternative source of sustenance and a strong aphrodisiac for male lions of certain prides Male lions usually weigh 159 to 180 kilograms but they can weigh more It is the only cat with a mane 

Lions live in groups that are called prides Ten to forty lions may live in a pride Each pride has a home area that is called its territory Lions do not allow other carnivores to hunt in their territory A territory can be as large as 260 square kilometres Lions sometimes live for over 20 years in captivity

Lions appear in heraldry more often than any other animal They may appear as a charge on the shield or as a crest They are described in the blazon by their tincture and attitude Sometimes the teeth and claws of a lion can be colored differently from the rest of its body it is said to be armed of that color Sometimes the tail is even described if it is shown in an unusual way One reason why lions are shown in so many different ways is because when heraldry developed a lot of people wanted a lion on their coat of arms but no two coats of arms can be the same The purpose of heraldry in the Middle Ages was to identify people with bold images over the outside of their armour Since a lot of people started putting lions on their coats of arms they placed them in a lot of different positions and in every color used in heraldry In France and Germany they even made patterns of colors on some of their lions as if they were painted Although there are many attitudes or positions now used in heraldry very few of these were known to medieval heralds who simply wanted to draw a lion to fill the space provided on the shield French heralds refer to lions in the walking positions as leopards but this term is seldom used by British heralds The following table describes the different attitudes of heraldic lions

Other terms are used to describe the lions position in further detail The lions head is normally seen in agreement with the overall position unless otherwise stated If a lions whole body is turned to face right he is to sinister or contourn If his whole body faces the viewer he is affront If his head only faces the viewer he is guardant or gardant and if he looks back over his shoulder he is regardant These words follow the main description of position and then the lion is further described as armed of another color if another color is used And finally the tail may be described if it is unusual A lion coward carries its tail between its hind legs The tail also may be nowed or the lion may be queue fourche or double queued

II ssDNA viruses

III dsRNA viruses

IV positive sense ssRNA virus

V negative sense ssRNA virus

VI ssRNA RT viruses

A virus is a tiny parasite which can infect living organisms It is made only of RNA protein coat sometimes of DNA protein 

Their method is to get their RNA strand into a prokaryote or eukaryote cell The RNA then takes over the cell machinery to reproduce itself and the protein coat The cell then bursts open spreading the virus

All viruses act in this way and there are no free living viruses 

Viruses are ubiquitous and all organisms suffer their attacks

Viruses are much smaller than bacteria They were not visible until the invention of the electron microscope A virus has a simple structure It has no internal cellular structure no cell wall or cell membrane They are made of only a protein coat that holds a string of nucleic acid 

With eukaryote cells the virus protein coat is able to enter the target cells via certain cell membrane receptors With prokaryote bacteria cells the bacteriophage physically injects the nucleic acid strand into the host cell

Viruses have the following characteristics 

When the host cell has finished making more viruses it undergoes lysis or breaks apart The viruses are released and are then able to infect other cells Viruses can remain intact for a long time and will infect cells when the time and conditions are right

Some specialised viruses are worth noting Bacteriophages are evolved to enter bacterial cells which have a different type of cell wall from eukaryote cell membranes Envelope viruses when they reproduce cover themselves with a modified form of the host cell membrane thus gaining an outer lipid layer that helps entry Some of our most difficult to combat viruses like influenza and HIV use this method

Viral infections in animals provoke an immune response that usually eliminates the infecting virus Immune responses can also be produced by vaccines which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection However some viruses including those causing AIDS and viral hepatitis evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections Antibiotics have no effect on viruses but several antiviral drugs have been developed

An enormous variety of genomic structures occur in viral species As a group they contain more structural genomic diversity than plants animals archaea or bacteria There are millions of different types of viruses but only about 5000 of them have been described in detail49

A virus has either RNA or DNA genes and is called an RNA virus or a DNA virus respectively The vast majority of viruses have RNA genomes Plant viruses tend to have single stranded RNA genomes and bacteriophages tend to have double stranded DNA genomes9699

Viral populations do not grow through cell division because they are acellular Instead they use the machinery and metabolism of a host cell to produce multiple copies of themselves and they assemble in the cell

The life cycle of viruses differs greatly between species but there are six basic stages in the life cycle of viruses7591

The infection of plant and fungal cells is different from that of animal cells Plants have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose and fungi one of chitin This means most viruses can only get inside these cells by force70 An example would be a virus travels on an insect vector which feeds on plant sap The damage done to cell walls would let the virus get in Bacteria like plants have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell However given that bacterial cell walls are much less thick than plant cell walls due to their much smaller size some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell wall while the viral capsid remains outside71

In some viruses the viral genome is put by genetic recombination into a specific place in the hosts chromosome The viral genome is then known as a provirus or in the case of bacteriophages a prophage60 Whenever the host divides the viral genome is also replicated The viral genome is mostly silent within the host however at some point the provirus or prophage may give rise to active virus which may lyse the host cellschapter 15 Enveloped viruses typically are released from the host cell after the virus acquires its envelope The envelope is a modified piece of the hosts plasma membrane1857

The genetic material within virus particles and the method by which the material is replicated varies considerably between different types of viruses

The bodys first line of defence against viruses is the innate immune system This has cells and other mechanisms which defend the host from any infection The cells of the innate system recognise and respond to pathogens in a general way

RNA interference is an important innate defence against viruses Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves double stranded RNA When such a virus infects a cell it releases its RNA molecule A protein complex called dicer sticks to it and chops the RNA into pieces Then a biochemical pathway called the RISC complex starts up This attacks the viral mRNA and the cell survives the infection 

Rotaviruses avoid this by not uncoating fully inside the cell and by releasing newly produced mRNA through pores in the particles inner capsid The genomic dsRNA remains protected inside the core of the virion

The production of interferon is an important host defence mechanism This is a hormone produced by the body when viruses are present Its role in immunity is complex it eventually stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cell and its close neighbours

Vertebrates have a second more specific immune system It is called the adaptive immune system When it meets a virus it produces specific antibodies that bind to the virus and render it non infectious Two types of antibodies are important 

The first called IgM is highly effective at neutralizing viruses but is produced by the cells of the immune system only for a few weeks The second called IgG is produced indefinitely The presence of IgM in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection whereas IgG indicates an infection sometime in the past IgG antibody is measured when tests for immunity are carried out

Another vertebrate defence against viruses is cell mediated immunity It involves immune cells known as T cells The bodys cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cells surface and if a T cell recognises a suspicious viral fragment there the host cell is destroyed by killer T cells and the virus specific T cells proliferate Cells such as macrophages are specialists at this antigen presentation 

Not all virus infections produce a protective immune response These persistent viruses evade immune control by sequestration blocking antigen presentation cytokine resistance evading natural killer cell activity escape from apoptosis and antigenic shift HIV evades the immune system by constantly changing the amino acid sequence of the proteins on the surface of the virion Other viruses called neurotropic viruses move along nerves to places the immune system cannot reach

Viruses do not belong to any of the six kingdoms They do not meet all the requirements for being classified as a living organism because they are not active until the point of infection However that is just a verbal point 

Obviously their structure and mode of operation means they have evolved from other living things and the loss of normal structure occurs in many endoparasites The origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are unclear some may have evolved from plasmids pieces of DNA that can move between cells while others may have evolved from bacteria In evolution viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer which increases genetic diversity

The largest virus yet discovered has been isolated from the ocean off the coast of Chile It is Megavirus chilensis and it is 10 to 20 times wider than the average virus It just beats the previous record holder Mimivirus which was found in a water cooling tower in the UK in 1992 

It is bigger than some bacteria and can be seen with an ordinary light microscope

Viruses are used widely in cell biology Geneticists often use viruses as vectors to introduce genes into cells that they are studying This is useful for making the cell produce a foreign substance or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time and interest in this approach is increasing because of the high level of antibiotic resistance now found in some pathogenic bacteria

A microprocessor is an electronic component that is used by a computer to do its work Microprocessors are a small silicon chips that contains millions of very small components including transistors resistors and diodes that work together Microprocessors help to do everything from writing to searching the Web Everything a computer does is described by lots of precise instructions and microprocessors carry out these instructions at incredible speedmillions or even billions of times a second

Microprocessors are used in personal computers cars military weapons and home appliances Some microprocessors are so small and inexpensive that they are used to control very simple products like flashlights and greeting cards that play music when you open them

Microprocessors use three steps commonly called Fetch Decode and Execute In the Fetch step an instruction is copied from the memory of the computer into the microprocessor In the Decode step the microprocessor figures out what operation the instruction is meant to do In the Execute step this operation is performed

Operations can be very simple like adding two numbers or complicated like copying a series of letters and numbers from one place in the computers memory to a different place

Heat is a form of energy In thermodynamics heat means energy which is moved between two things when one of them is hotter than the other 

Heat is not the same as temperature The temperature of an object is a measure of the average speed of the moving particles it is made from and the energy of the particles is called the internal energy When an object is heated its internal energy can increase to make the object hotter The first law of thermodynamics says that the increase in internal energy is equal to the heat added minus the work done on the surroundings

Heat is a form of energy and not a physical substance Heat has no mass

Heat can move from one place to another in different ways

The measure of how much heat is needed to cause some change in temperature for a material is the specific heat capacity of the material If the particles in the material are hard to move then more energy is needed to make them move quickly so a lot of heat will cause a small change in temperature A different particle that is easier to move will need less heat for the same change in temperature

Specific heat capacities can be looked up in a table like this one

Unless some work is done heat moves only from hot things to cold things

Heat can be measured That is the amount of heat given out or taken in can be given a value One of the units of measurement for heat is the joule

Heat is usually measured with a calorimeter where the energy in a material is allowed to flow into nearby water which has a known specific heat capacity The temperature of the water is then measured before and after and heat can be found using a formula

In feudal Japan Shogun ruled the country but does not have power over the emperor The emperor chooses the shogun Shogun was not the king or emperor but got this rank by Tenno a Japanese emperor Shogun means general in the Japanese language Its full name was Seii Taishogun

In earlier times Shogun were generals for emperors and not the ruler of Japan In 1192 a samurai military leader Minamoto no Yoritomo got the title of Shogun by the last Emperor Go Shirakawa Since people thought Shogun was thought the leader of all samurai and the leader of Japan Except the latter middle of the 16th century Shogun ruled Japan

The office of the Shogun is called the Shogunate In Japanese it is called Bakufu meaning office in a tent because Shogun had been originally military leader and he had his office with a tent in a battle field

There were three Shogunates in Japan

In 1868 the 15th Shogun of Tokugawa Shogunate Tokugawa Yosinobu gave up his office Then the time of Shogun rule ended It was the end of the feudal time of Japan

Bratislava is the capital city of Slovakia About 450000 people live there It used to be called Pressburg or Pozsony and by some other names Bratislava is the seat of national government the presidency and the parliament It has several museums galleries and of other educational cultural and economic institutions

There is a small Old Town and a castle called Bratislavsk Hrad The Danube river goes through Bratislava 

Bratislava had many names through its history Here are some of them

and many others

Bratislava is in the extreme southwest of Slovakia on the borders with Austria and Hungary and not far from the Czech Republic border It is on the Morava and Danube rivers

People have lived here since the Neolithic age The Celts inhabited this area from 400 BC 50 BC The Roman Empire set up border military camps near Bratislava from the 1st century until the 5th century for example Gerulata The Slavs started moving here from the 6th century Bratislava was part of the Slavic empire called Great Moravia in the 9th century From the second half of the 10th century until 1918 it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary with some exceptions It was even capital of the Kingdom between 1524 and 18301848 After the World War I ended in 1918 it was part of newly founded Czechoslovakia until 1939 when it became capital of World War II Slovak Republic until 1945 After 1945 it was part of Czechoslovakia again becoming capital of Slovak Socialist Republic in 1968 After the event called Velvet Divorce when the Czechoslovakia broke up Bratislava became capital of Slovakia

List of notable structures

Economy of Bratislava is prosperous and based on automobile industry chemical industry and services The unemployment is lowest in Slovakia Approximately 250000 people from all over the Slovakia travel to Bratislava for work

Position of Bratislava made it a natural crossroads for international traffic It is a motorway junction rail junction has its own international airport The international river traffic passes along the Danube through Bratislava with its own river port

Bratislava has its own public transport system with buses trams and trolleybuses

Bratislava is divided into 5 national districts and 17 city parts 

Further it is divided into 20 cadastral areas which are identical with the city parts with 2 exceptions

Wellington is the capital of New Zealand It has been the capital since 1865 Before then Auckland was the capital Wellington is the second largest city in New Zealand It had about 448000 people in 2006 Wellington is the southernmost capital city in the world

Wellington is in the middle of New Zealand at the south end of the North Island South of Wellington is Cook Strait the sea between the North Island and the South Island The city has a lot of hills and a deep harbour The middle of the city is busier than most small cities and is easy for people to walk around

Wellington recently became famous because the The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy was made there

Biochemistry is the study of chemical reactions involved with living beings It is important to cell biology and physiology The study of biochemistry involves enzymes nucleic acids carbohydrates sugars proteins and lipids

Enzymes are special types of protein that act to speed up a chemical reaction in a living thing The function of enzymes is to start speed up and help chemical reactions and lower the activation energy There are a few enzymes that are not proteins but ribonucleic acids which are called ribozymes

Nucleic acids are long chain molecules Nucleotides are made They are the building blocks for living organisms DNA is a common type of nucleic acid which is usually join up together into a chain called a double helix Its the substance of heredity and contains huge amount of information that direct life activities RNA is another common type of nucleic acid also having important roles in living organisms

Carbohydrates include sugars and starches The simplest carbohydrate are the monosaccharides meaning single sugar Examples of monosaccharides are glucose and fructose Monosaccharides can be combined into chains by dehydration synthesis Polysaccharides are long molecules made from many units joined together Examples are starch glycogen and cellulose 

Proteins are polymers of amino acids There are twenty different common types of amino acid 

Lipids are fats and waxes Saturated lipids contain single bonds and are found in butter and lard They are often solid at room temperature Unsaturated lipids have one or more double bonds The human body stores lipids as an energy source When the body needs a large amount of energy lipid molecules are broken down to release that energy

Sadness is an emotion It is the opposite of happiness People feel sad when something bad has happened for example if someone they love has died or if they are parted from friends The word miserable has a similar meaning

In big letters SAD or SAD is short for Seasonal Affective Disorder SAD is a sickness that some people have in the winter They feel depressed as the nights become longer and there is less daylight

When people are very sad and for a long time the person could have a serious mental illness called depression or Bipolar disorder

It is normally thought of as the opposite of happiness but you can feel both happy and sad at the same time

Signs of sadness include people being less social and crying

Microeconomics is the science of how people make decisions at the small scale It is different from macroeconomics which looks at how the economy works as a whole In microeconomics we might look at how a person chooses what to buy at the store or how many things a company will make Some parts of microeconomics include Consumer Theory and Theory of the Firm which study how people and businesses make decisions Game Theory looks at how people make decisions when the outcome depends on what decision another person makes when agents are said to act strategically

A port can mean different things

Cryptography is the practice and study of hiding information It is sometimes called code breaking but this is not really a correct name It is the science used to try to keep information secret and safe Modern cryptography is a mix of mathematics computer science and electrical engineering Cryptography is used in ATM cards computer passwords and shopping on the internet

When a message is sent using cryptography it is changed before it is sent The change makes the message hard to read If someone wants to read it they need to change it back How to change it back is a secret Both the person that sends the message and the one that gets it should know the secret way to change it but other people should not be able to

Types of Cryptography Different types of cryptography can be easier or harder to use and can hide the secret better or worse

Computers can do hard math very fast and because of this they can do very strong encryption Examples are computer algorithms like RSA AES Blowfish and many others Using good algorithms like these can make it very hard to read the information that is sent

People are better at patterns changing order of words or letters and using words with different meanings Because people are slower than computers any cryptography they use can probably be broken if enough of the secret way to change it is known

Simple forms of cryptography that people can do are Caesar ciphers and Straddling checkerboard but there are lots more

Tuesday is the day of the week between Monday and Wednesday In some countries for example the United States of America Tuesday is the third day of the week In other parts of the world Tuesday is the second day of the week

The name Tuesday comes from a Middle English word Tiwesday This word came from the Old English word Tiwes dg This was named after the Nordic god Tyr Tyr was the God of War like the Roman war god Mars and Greek god Ares

In Latin Tuesday is called Martis dies which means Marss Day In French Spanish Italian and Romanian the the word for Tuesday is nearly the same as the Latin name Tuesday is mardi in French martes in Spanish marted in Italian dimarts in Catalan and mari in Romanian 

The Celtic languages still spoken use the Latin names even though none of these languages came from Latin Tuesday is d mirt in Irish Meurzh in Breton dydd Mawrth in Welsh and Dimirt in Scottish Gaelic 

The English and Scandinavian names for Tuesday come from the Nordic god Tyr

In some countries like the United States of America Wednesday is the fourth day of the week In other parts of the world Wednesday is said to be the third day of the week

Wednesday is named after the Norse god Woden

According to ISO 8601 Thursday is either the fourth or fifth day of the week It comes after Wednesday and before Friday Thursday is named after the Norse god Thor

In some countries like the United States of America Friday is the sixth day of the week In other parts of the world Friday is said to be the fifth day of the week When a Friday lands upon the 13th day of a month it is considered to be unlucky

Some people consider Friday to be the last day of the week before the weekend as some people finish work or school before the weekend Others see Friday night as part of the weekend since work or school is over for the week Because many people are happy to not have to go to work during the weekend there are sayings like Thank God its Friday

It is named after Freyja

In some countries like the United States of America Saturday is the seventh day of the week In other parts of the world like the United Kingdom Saturday is said to be the sixth day of the week It is also the day of worship for Jewish people Along with Sunday it makes up the weekend Its name comes from the Roman god Saturn

Lao Peoples Democratic Republic or Laos for short is a small country in southeast Asia The capital of Laos is Vientiane

Laos is landlocked It is bordered by Myanmar and by China to the northwest by Vietnam to the east by Cambodia to the south and by Thailand to the west The Mekong river forms a large part of the western boundary with Thailand Boats from Laos cannot get to the ocean using the Mekong because of rapids and waterfalls in the south of the country 

Laos had a long history before becoming a French colony Fa Ngum created the first unifed Lao Kingdom  In 1949 it became independent from France as the Kingdom of Laos Later there was a civil war and in 1975 it became a republic under control of the communist party 

The official language is Lao a language belonging to the Tai language group 98 of Lao people believe in Buddhism The main crop in Laos is rice

Amaterasu Amaterasu mikami or hiru menomuchi no kami in Japanese mythology is the Sun Goddess and the most sacred of all Shinto deities Her name Amaterasu means literally illuminates Heaven Her shrine is located at Ise

In the Kojiki tradition Amaterasu is the sister of Susanoo the god of the sea and storms and of Tsukuyomi the god of the moon All three were created from Izanagi when he washed his face to clean the dirtiness of Yomi the underworld Amaterasu was born when Izanagi washed out his left eye Tsukuyomi was born from the washing of the right eye and Susanoo from the washing of the nose

The tales tell of great broken wikt linkrivalryrivalry between Amaterasu and Susanoo When he was to leave Heaven forever because Izanagi ordered him to he went to say goodbye to his sister Amaterasu suspicious proposed him a challenge each of them was to turn an object of the others into people Amaterasu created three women from Susanoos sword while he created five men from her necklace Amaterasu said the men were hers because they were born of her necklace Susanoo destroyed her rice fields threw a dead pony into her loom and killed one of her assistants in anger For this Amaterasu sad angry and scared went to hide inside Ama no Iwato the heavenly rock cave so the Sun was hidden and the world became dark for along time The Oni came out to the dark world and the gods could not make Amaterasu come out of the cave

The intelligent goddess of happiness Ama no Uzume took a small boat turned it upside down near the cave entrance and began a dance on it tearing off her clothing in front of the other Kami They thought this was so funny that they laughed happily

Amaterasu heard them and looked out to see why the gods were laughing When she opened the cave she saw her wonderful reflection in a mirror Uzume had put on a tree and slowly came out of the cave

At that moment the god Ameno Tajikarawo closed the cave behind her so she could not go back in Another god tied a magic rope across the entrance The sun goddess was then asked by the Kami Ame no Koyane to go back with the gods She agreed and light came back to the earth but Susanoo was punished by being banished from Heaven

An organism is a living thing Animals and plants are organisms Organisms are a biotic or living part of the environment Rocks and sunshine are a part of the abiotic or non living environment

Organisms have five basic needs They need air water nutrients energy and a place to live Animals and plants are organisms

Some organisms are made up of millions of cells They are called multicellular organisms Some examples are dogs trees and humans Most multicellular organisms can be seen without using a microscope 

Some organisms are so small that they cannot be seen with the naked eye You need a microscope to see them They are called microorganisms Organisms can be made up of just one cell They are called unicellular organisms or single celled organisms Examples include bacteria amoeba and protozoa such as the paramecium

Kinetic energy is the energy which refers to moving objects So you can think of Kinetic energy as the energy of movement because it refers to any object that is moving at that present time This energy can be changed into other sorts of energy such as heat potential energy or even light However heat light sound mechanical energy electrical and other types of energy are also types of kinetic energy

Meteors bullets from a gun and a kicked football have kinetic energy

Potential energy is a form of stored energy For example when a rock is brought up a hill and is left on the hill the rock gains gravitational potential energy When we stretch a rubber band we say that the rubber band has gained elastic potential energy Food that we eat has chemical potential energy Batteries also have chemical potential energy

Potential energy is divided into three different types of energy 

The Gravitational Potential Energy formula used here is only used when the objects are very near the surface of the Earth because the acceleration must be the same during the change in height

A ship is a large vehicle used to travel on water It is bigger than a boat Ships are used for travel trade and war

The first ships used oars or the wind to make them move

From about 4000BC the Ancient Egyptians were making wooden sail boats By 1200BC the Phoenicians and Greeks had begun to make bigger sailing ships which were about 30 metres long and could carry 90 180 tonnes of cargo The Romans made even bigger ships which could carry up to 1000 people and 1000 tonnes of cargo The 8th century saw the rise of the Vikings who were famous for their longships and which were mainly used for raiding other countries but also for trading The longships had flat bottoms so they could move in shallow rivers

Sailing ships were used for thousands of years but they were very important in wars and trade from the 1500s to the 1800s The Chinese admiral Zheng He commanded a fleet of treasure ships on seven voyages all over Asia up to East Africa in the early fifteenth century These ships probably were about 130 m long and up to 50 m wide That makes them about twice the size of the largest European ships in the sixteenth century The most successful and largest fleet in the 17th century was the Dutch fleet For trade and transport the Dutch often used a particular kind of trading ship called a flute Transport of people and cargo on sailing ships continued until the 1920s 

Some famous ships from this era include

In the 19th century steam ships were invented

Most modern ships have diesel engines

At one time Titanic Olympic and Britannic were the largest ships in the world Titanic sank on her maiden voyage after hitting an iceberg becoming one of the most famous shipwrecks of all time the Olympic was Titanic s nearly identical twin and actually set sail before Titanic and was scrapped in the 1930s after a very successful career including her being a passenger liner and a warship in WWI The Britannic was the larger of these three sister ships and was supposed to be more grand and elegant than the Titanic but before she set sail on her maiden voyage WWI broke out and she was stripped of her elegant furniture and elaborate paneling and became a hospital ship During her term as a hospital ship she was sunk by either a mine or torpedo no one knows for sure The Titanic lies at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Nova Scotia and the Britannic lies in the Aegean Sea off the coast of the Island of Kea

A boat is a vehicle used to travel on water It is smaller than a ship Some boats have sails some are powered by rowing with oars and some use motors 

These boats are usually made of wood However some parts are made of metals like steel and aluminium Expensive boats may have parts from fiberglass or composite materials

The navy is the part of a countrys military that fights on water using boats People in the navy are called sailors The navy is mostly made up of warships It may also have its own air force and soldiers It also may have special boats that can go underwater called submarines

Originally Naval war was fought by ramming other ships and then boarding them In Ancient Greece and Rome the ships were usually powered by oars Then during the Middle Ages the cannon was invented These could be shot at other ships from a great distance Ships around this time also began to use sails instead of oars for power In the 1800s ships began to be plated in armor for protection This also required a change in their power because they became heavier Steam engines were used These early warships called ironclads are thought to have begun the type of Naval warfare used today

An air force is the branch of a countrys military which fights in the air The air force is made up of aircraft such as fighters bombers helicopters and transport aircraft

Aircraft in an air force sometimes fly in a formation Formations are when the aircraft fly in a pattern

The biggest air force in the world is the United States Air Force

Adware is an advertising computer program that can be put by other people on someones computer sometimes without their permission It is controversial because sometimes businesses put the program there so they can see what people are doing or what web pages they are browsing They then put an advertisement that is of the same subject as the web page the person is looking at This can be good if the person is trying to buy something but many people do not want advertisements Many people also do not want other people to find out what they are doing or what web pages they are looking at An example is in the popular peer to peer file sharing program Kazaa When someone downloads it it installs adware on their computer that then sends advertisements to the computer Some people do not like this so they use an illegally changed version of this program called Kazaa Lite

Removal tools have been developed to assist users in clearing out these unwanted programs Like many programs that people use for security the program must be changed often Updating allows the removal tool to recognize new types of adware This can be done by downloading files over the internet using the update option in the program

Gender means type It is a word commonly used for a persons sex When people use the word gender in this way it is often because sex has many other meanings making it easy to misunderstand

In social sciences there is a difference between sex and gender

Dutch is the language spoken in the Netherlands In Dutch the language is called Nederlands It is also spoken in the northern half of Belgium They also speak it in Suriname A language developed from Dutch called Afrikaans is spoken in South Africa and Namibia About 22 million people speak the language worldwide Dutch is related to German 

Dutch is a Germanic language so it is related to German The Dutch of before 1170 is called Old Dutch The Dutch between 1170 and 1500 is called Middle Dutch which is also called Diets Thats why Dutch is called Dutch in English The oldest Dutch book known is Wachtendonckse Psalmen which was written in 900 The first Dutch writer we know by name is Hendrik van Veldeke who was born around 1150

Dutch uses the same roman alphabet as English 

Note The e can also be a schwa

The way of how vowels are pronounced depends on the fact if the syllable is open or closed If a syllable is open short written vowels are spoken as long ones Short written vowels are only spoken short if the syllable is closed Example

There is however an exception to this rule This is the e This is because e can also be a stupid e In most words where an open syllable ends with e it is a stupid e Therefore open syllables with a long e are written as ee Example

There are however exceptions to this rule as well This can be seen in the word meenemen This word can be divided into three syllables meenemen The es in the first two syllables are long ones but the last one is a stupid e 

The stupid e also occurs in the ending of verbs

Note In words that end with d the d is pronounced like t

The grammar of Dutch is slightly different from English The order in which words are put in sentences are different in complex sentences The most simple sentence structure is Subject  Verb The Dutch language has few grammatical tenses The most used are

The most simple verb time is the Onvoltooid Tegenwoordige Tijd The ott is used when something is occurring now or regularly Most verbs are conjugated in a regular form The word stem of the verb is still there in all of the conjugations The correct way of doing this is

Note The stem of a verb is the infintive of the verb without the final en In some verbs the first syllable is open and any vowel therefore is long The stem changes to a written long vowel So the stem of lopen becomes loop If the en is then added to the stem the written form becomes short again

The past form of the ott is the Onvoltooid Verleden Tijd The way how verbs are conjugated in the ovt is not easy to understand and is mistaken often This is because some verbs are conjugated by adding a D while others are conjugated while adding a T A way of solving this problem is the socalled t Kofschip If the verb without en ends with a consonant which is also in t Kofschip the verb is changed with a T Example

The verb can now be changed as the following

There are however words in which t Kofschip is not so easy This is for instance in the word vrezen The stem of the verb is vrees so it seems that the verb is changed with a T This is not true because vrezen minus en is vrez The Z is not in t Kofschip so the verb is changed with a D

The verb can now be changed as the following

Although the Dutch have a kind of present continuous they do not use it much Example

Actually there are three types of continuous verbs in Dutch 

In number with three digits the Dutch change the u into o and replace 1 of the rs Example

An alphabet is a writing system a list of symbols for writing The basic symbols in an alphabet are called letters In an alphabet each letter is a symbol for a sound or related sounds To make the alphabet work better more signs assist the reader punctuation marks spaces standard reading direction and so on

The name alphabet comes from Aleph and Beth the first two letters in the Phoenician alphabet

The alphabet in this article is the Roman alphabet It was first used in Ancient Rome to write Latin Today many languages also use the Latin alphabet it is the most used alphabet today

A list of alphabets and examples of the languages they are used for

It seems that the idea of an alphabet a script based entirely upon sound arose only once and has been copied and adapted to suit many different languages Although no alphabet fits its language perfectly it is flexible enough to fit any language approximately It was a unique inventionp12

Our alphabet is called the Roman alphabet as compared with the Cyrillic and other alphabets All of these come from the ancient Greek alphabet which dates back to about 1100 to 800BCp167 The Greek alphabet was probably developed from the Phoenician script which appeared somewhat earlier and had some similar letter shapes 

The Phoenicians spoke a Semitic language usually called Canaanite The Semitic group of languages includes Arabic Maltese Hebrew and also Aramaic the language spoken by Jesus We do not know much about how the alphabetic idea arose but the Phoenicians a trading people came up with letters which were adapted by the early Greeks to produce their alphabet The one big difference is that the Phoenician script had no pure vowels Arabic script has vowels which may but do not have to be shown by diacritics The oldest Quran manuscripts had no diacritics and Israeli children to about the third grade use texts with vowel dots addedp89 

No ancient script alphabetic or not had pure vowels before the Greeks The Greek alphabet even has two vowels for e and two for o to distinguish between the long and short sounds It is fairly clear from this that careful thought went into both the Phoenician invention and the Greek adaptation but no details survive of either process

Semitic scripts apparently derive from Proto Sinaitic a script of which only 31 inscriptions are known It is thought by some researchers that the original source of this script was the Egyptian hieratic script which by the late Middle Kingdom had added some alphabetic signs for representing the consonants of foreign names Egyptian activity in Sinai was at its height at that time A similar idea had been suggested many years previously

Other writing systems do not use symbols that mean a sound but symbols that mean a word or a syllable In the past such writing systems were used by many cultures but today they are almost only used by languages people speak in Asia

A county is the name for a piece of land It has a different meaning in different languages Originally the word was for the land under a count Today a county is often something between a larger state and a smaller town or district

County governments keep records and organize elections and laws

Canada has ten provinces Five of them have counties in them In Ontario Nova Scotia and New Brunswick these are local government units but in Quebec and Prince Edward Island they are now only geographical units Statistics

The word county is the English name for the Chinese word xin On Mainland China under the Peoples Republic of China counties are the third level of local government On Taiwan the county is the highest governmental level below the Republic of China central government 

There are about 2000 counties in China this number is about the same as in the Han dynasty 2000 years ago The county is one of the oldest levels of government in China

Before prefecture and district were names for xin before the Republic of China People started using the English name county after the start of the Republic of China

The head of a county is the magistrate

Counties started to be units of regional self government in Croatia in 1990 There are twenty counties and the city of Zagreb which has the same status They are called upanije and their leader is a upan

There was a change in the historical counties of France in 1790 after the Revolution The new government unit was the dpartement But French people use the word county in the name of the Free County region the old Free County of Burgundy 

The government unit of Hungary is megye or in Latin comitatus This is the same as the word county Today Hungary has 19 counties 20 city counties and 1 capital Budapest The comitatus was also the unit in the Kingdom of Hungary

Ireland originally had 32 counties in the nineteenth century 26 of these later formed the Republic of Ireland and 6 formed Northern Ireland The counties were in 4 provinces  Leinster Munster Connacht and Ulster 

In the 1970s in Northern Ireland and in the 1990s in the Republic of Ireland there was a change in the county numbers and borders In the Republic for example the change broke Dublin County into four parts Dublin City Dn Laoghaire  Rathdown Fingal and South Dublin County Tipperary is really two counties Tipperary North Riding and Tipperary South Riding The towns Cork Galway Limerick and Waterford are now separated from the countryside areas of their counties So the Republic of Ireland now has thirty four county level units But for sports culture etc people normally talk about the original 32 counties and 4 provinces

Each county has a flagcolours and often a nickname too

County is one name for gun which is a part of a prefecture Other names for gun are rural district rural area or district People do not like to use district because the usual translation of district is choume 

Today counties have no political power or organisation use Postal services use it

After New Zealand ended its provinces in 1876 they began using a county system as in other countries They used it until 1989

During the second half of the 20th century many people went to the country counties from nearby cities Because of this sometimes they put the two together making a district Or sometimes they changed the name to district or city

In 1974 they had a big change they made the organisation the same all over New Zealand Today the country has cities and districts but no counties

Norway has 19 Counties Until 1972 Bergen was a county but today it is a municipality in the county of Hordaland All counties have municipalities 

Each county has an assembly Norwegians choose the people in the assembly every 4 years The counties work with high schools and roads etc Some people and political parties such as the Conservatives Hyre want the end of the counties Others want to make some of them into larger regions

In English we normally call the Polish second level organisation unit powiat a county or district

The smaller units of Romania are called jude This name comes from jude a judge of a city Today Romania has 40 counties and the capital Bucharest has a separate status 

We sometimes call the units of Serbia counties but more often we call them districts 

In 1634 the old provinces in Sweden had a new name counties Today there are 21 Counties and in each County there are Municipalities The Swedish name is Ln

In the United Kingdom there are 92 traditional counties 86 in Great Britain and 6 in Northern Ireland The British counties are different ages

In England in Anglo Saxon times Shires were units for getting taxes They usually had a town at their centre People called these towns the shire town The shires had the same name as their shire town Later people called these towns the county town The name county came from the Normans from a Norman word for an area under a Count

In 1539 Wales got thirteen counties The counties in Scotland are this age or older

The county boundaries of England are different today In medieval times some important cities got the status of counties for example London Bristol and Coventry Some small places eg Islandshire were also counties In 1844 a lot of these small places returned to their old counties

The name county is also used in 48 of the 50 states of the United States for the next government unit smaller than the state Louisiana uses the name parishes and Alaska uses boroughs The US Census Bureau lists 3141 counties or organisation units of this sort The power of the county government is very different in every state

In New England counties are mostly for law In Connecticut Massachusetts and Rhode Island they have no governmental use they are only geographic names Most power is in the towns In other places than New England counties are for the police water gas and electricity libraries statistics and birth certificates County sheriffs are the head of the police in some states for areas outside of cities and towns Other places have County Police and county sheriffs are for the law Each county has a county seat usually the biggest town where the county offices are 

In Western states for example California the county is the basic unit of local government

New York University also known as NYU is a big university in New York City It is a place where people take college classes 

Bees are flying insects of the Order Hymenoptera which also includes ants wasps and sawflies There are about 20000 species of bees Bees collect pollen from flowers Bees can be found on all continents except Antarctica

Bees fall into four groups

The European honey bee are kept by humans for honey Keeping bees to make honey is called beekeeping or apiculture

The earliest animal pollinated flowers were pollinated by insects such as beetles long before bees first appeared Bees are different because they are specialized as pollination agents with behavioral and physical modifications that make pollination easier Bees are generally better at the task than other pollinating insects such as beetles flies butterflies and pollen wasps The appearance of such floral specialists is believed to have driven the adaptive radiation of the angiosperms and in turn the bees themselves

Bees like ants are a specialized form of wasp The ancestors of bees were wasps in a family which preyed on other insects The switch from insect prey to pollen may have resulted from the capture of prey insects that were covered with pollen when they were fed to the wasp larvae Similar behaviour could be switched to pollen collection This same evolutionary scenario has occurred within the vespoid wasps where the group known as pollen wasps also evolved from predatory ancestors 

A recently reported bee fossil of the genus Melittosphex is considered an extinct lineage of pollen collecting Apoidea sister group to the modern bees and dates from the Lower Cretaceous Features of its morphology place it clearly within the bees but it retains two unmodified ancestral traits of the legs which betray its origin The issue is still under debate and the phylogenetic relationships among bee families are poorly understood

Like other insects the body of a bee can be divided into three parts the head thorax and abdomen Also like other insects bees have three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings Many bees are hairy and have yellow and black or orange and black warning colors

Many bees have stings on the rear of their bodies If they get confused angry or scared they may sting and inject venom which hurts Once a worker bee has stung it dies after a short while but other types of bee and wasp can sting again Some people are allergic to bee stings and can even die from them

Some bees are eusocial insects this means they live in organized groups called colonies Honey bees the kind of bee used in beekeeping are eusocial The home of a bee colony is called a hive 

There are three kinds of bees in a honey bee colony A queen bee is the most important bee in the colony because she will lay the eggs The queen bee only uses her stinger to sting other queen bees The queen is usually the mother of the worker bees She ate a special jelly called royal jelly from when she was young Worker bees are females too and they are the bees that collect pollen from flowers and will fight to protect the colony Workers do a waggle dance to tell the others where they have found nectar Karl von Frisch discovered this

Drone bees mate with the queen bee so that she can lay eggs The only function of the male drone is to mate They do no other work in the hive

Dragonflies are flying insects of the order Odonata There are about 5300 species of dragonfly They eat other flying insects

Dragonflies have large compound eyes which is their main sense organ They have four strong transparent wings and a long body Even though dragonflies have six legs they cannot walk 

Dragonflies are usually found around lakes ponds streams and wetlands They are predators which eat mosquitoes and other small insects such as flies bees ants and butterflies Their larvae known as nymphs are aquatic

Dragonflies have been around for 300 million years In the Carboniferous period some species had wing spans of over convert2ftcm0lkonabbron 

Dragonflies are in one suborder of the Odonata and their relatives the damselflies are in another suborder Many people mistake the damselfly for the dragonfly because they look alike 

Adult damselflies have thinner more delicate bodies than those of dragonflies This you can see even when they are flying When at rest most damselflies hold their wings together above the body Most dragonflies hold their wings horizontally The eyes of dragonflies are larger and touch each other

Female dragonflies lay eggs in or near water often on plants When laying eggs some species go under the water to lay their eggs on a good surface The eggs then hatch into nymphs While in the nymph stage they eat mosquito larvae and other things 

Most of a dragonflys life is spent in the nymph form beneath the waters surface It is quite active It can extend its jaws in front of its mouth to catch prey Tiny vertebrates such as tadpoles and fish are part of its diet Some nymphs even hunt on land They draw water in and out of their rectum They can move fast by squirting water out of the anus They also have gills in their rectum 

The larval stage of large dragonflies may last as long as five years In smaller species this stage may last between two months and three years When the larva is ready to metamorphose into an adult it climbs up a reed or other emergent plant Exposure to air causes the larva to begin breathing The skin splits at a weak spot behind the head and the adult dragonfly crawls out of its old larval skin pumps up its wings and flies off to feed on midges and flies The adult stage of larger species of dragonfly can last as long as five or six months

Dragonflies experience incomplete metamorphosis the nymphs swim and live underwater like fish The female dragonfly lays her fertilized eggs near or right in the water The naiads which do not look much like dragonflies at all hatch and immediately take to the water 

While living in the water the naiads eat as many aquatic insects as possible as well as other small creatures like tadpoles and minnows Hidden among the plants a naiad will lie in wait for prey to swim by It can then squeeze water out of the rear of its abdomen like a jet stream This moves the naiad forward very quickly allowing it to snatch its prey with its powerful jaws Some naiads even have a long lower jaw that can shoot out and grab prey 

Naiads live in the water for weeks and undergo a series of molts to grow When a naiad is ready for its final molt it finds a stick or other object sticking out of the water It use this to crawl out of the water and wait for its exoskeleton to dry As the exoskeleton cracks open at the seam the adult dragonfly crawls out

Dragonflies have tremendous eyesight Their compound eyes are very large and have up to 50000 individual lenses Their eyes wrap around the top of the head As a result they have a wide field of vision they can see almost everywhere at once Sight is by far their most important sense used to catch flies and avoid birds

In flight the adult dragonfly can move in six directions upward downward forward back and side to side They can also hover quite well in midair and then they can take off at speeds of up to convert35mphkmh0lkonabbron Scientists discovered dragonflies can move each of their four wings independently which gives them their flying abilities Dragonflies bend and twist their wings to cause little whirlwinds that move the air even faster over the upper part of the airfoil reducing air pressure even more than most flying animals can This gives them a lot of lift even in the face of powerful winds

Some dragonflies change their resting position to prevent overheating They may use a handstand like position to prevent overheating on sunny days The abdomen is raised until its tip points at the sun minimizing their surface area exposed to the heat The position is called the obelisk posture The species that do this are called perchers they are sit and wait predators which spend much of their time keeping still 

Wind is the flow of gases On Earth wind is mostly the movement of air In outer space solar wind is the movement of gases or particles from the sun through space The strongest winds seen on a planet in our solar system are on Neptune and Saturn

Short bursts of fast winds are called gusts Strong winds that go on for about one minute are called squalls Winds that go on for a long time are called many different things such as breeze gale hurricane and typhoon

Wind can move land especially in deserts Cold wind can sometimes have a bad effect on livestock Wind also affects animals food stores their hunting and the way they protect themselves

If there is a high pressure system near a low pressure system the air will move from the high pressure to the low pressure to try and even out the pressures If there is a small difference in pressure there will be breezes and light winds If there is a big difference in pressure the winds will be high and in some storms such as hurricanes typhoons cyclones or tornadoes the pressure differences can cause winds faster than 200mph This can cause damage to houses and other buildings and can also lead to death

Wind can also be caused by the rising of hot air or the falling of cool air When hot air rises it creates a low pressure underneath it and air moves in to equalize the pressure When cold air drops it creates a high pressure and flows out to even out the pressure with the low pressure around it

The wind is usually invisible but rain dust or snow can let you see how it is blowing A weathervane can also show you where the wind is coming from The Beaufort scale is a way to tell how strong the wind is It is used at sea when no land can be seen 

The increase in wind causes an increase in the rate of evaporation

High winds can cause damage depending on how strong they are Sometimes gusts of wind can make poorly made bridges move or be destroyed like the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940 Power can go out because of wind even if its speed is as low as convertspus23knkmh This is because tree branches could change the flow of energy through power lines No species of tree can resist hurricane force winds but trees with roots that are not very deep can be blown over more easily Trees such as eucalyptus sea hibiscus and avocado are brittle and are damaged more easily

Wind in outer space called solar wind is very different from a wind on earth The wind in outer space is caused by the sun and it is made up of particles that came out of the suns atmosphere Like solar wind the planetary wind is made up of light gases that have come out of planets atmospheres

The doldrums are in the equatorial region It is a wind belt where air is warm with little pressure variations Winds are light there Another name for doldrums is Intertropical Convergence Zone

A vertebrate is an animal with a spinal cord surrounded by cartilage or bone The word comes from vertebrae the bones that make up spines Animal which are not vertebrates are called invertebrate

Examples of vertebrates are mammals birds and fish Sharks and related skates and rays are vertebrates with cartilage instead of bones

An alpha male is the top ranking animal in a social group

Some animals live in a social structure where the more powerful male in the group is decided by either simple play fights or even very aggressive battles The current alpha male must defend his ranking from younger members When he is too old or not strong enough to win he loses his position in the group

The result of this is that the alpha male usually has more opportunity to mate with the available females This system developed because strong males will produce young which have a better chance for survival

Brave New World  a novel written in 1931 by Aldous Huxley a British writer  grades humans into categories taken from the Greek alphabet Alphas were the highest ranking

Some animal groups which may have alpha males

Alpha male can also refer to an aggressive highly ranked man in a human group usually in a business setting

A new term which is entering our lexicon is the Alpha Dad Men that enter young adulthood that can be considered Alpha Males often mature to become Alpha Dads the Alpha Male with children or simply a more mature example of the same The Alpha Dad retains many of the same traits as the Alpha Male  the apex of a social or peer oriented heirarchy  but the objectives and social dominance perspectives diminish with emphasis placed on the performance and integrity of the individual rather than social position

Street is a town in the county of Somerset England It is in the Mendip District

The Republic of Singapore or Singapore is an island country at the southern end of the Malay peninsula in Asia Singapore is north of the equator Its neighbours are Malaysia and Indonesia About 508 million people live in Singapore of which 377 million are citizens and many of them are Chinese In Sanskrit an old Indian language Singapura from which Singapore got its name means Lion city

Singapore is also called a Garden City because there are many trees everywhere which makes it look more like a garden

The national language of Singapore is Malay and the other official languages of Singapore are English Mandarin and Tamil English is the language of choice because it is the language that almost everyone in Singapore knows It is the first language taught in schools and the language used by the government Students are also taught their mother tongue language This means that the Chinese can learn Mandarin and the Malays can learn Malay and so on Students can also learn a third language in Secondary School

Singapore is also known for Singlish or Singaporean English which is English mixed with some words from Malay and other local languages The government runs a campaign the Speak Good English Movement against Singlish as it makes Singaporeans look less educated and intelligent than they are

Singapores name comes from Singa Pura which means Lion City in Sanskrit According to the Sejarah Melayu a Sumatran prince called Sang Nila Utama landed on Temasek and saw a Lion which is called Singa in Malay Thus he gave the island a new name Singapura There were also many pieces of old items that showed that Temasek was a trading port even before the British came in and took over the island

Singapore was set up as a British trading town in 1819 by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles and became an important town in the Malay Archipelago Singapore The country was given colony rank in 1867

When Raffles landed in Singapore he paid the then Sultan a sum of money for a piece of land in the South of Singapore In August 1824 Dr John Crawfurd signed a treaty with the Sultan for control over the whole island

In 1941 due to the weak defenses of the country the Japanese attacked Singapore and took control of the colony on 15 February 1942 The country was renamed to Syonan to meaning Light of the South during the rule The British decided to surrender to the Japanese on 15 February 1942 at the Ford Motor Factory People of Singapore went through hard times during the Japanese rule until the surrender of the Japanese in September 1945 This was called the Japanese occupation Singapore was then returned back to the British 

Many people were tortured or killed by the Japanese as they did not follow the rules properly or because they were suspected of going against the Japanese

The hard times during World War II made the people think that the British were not as strong as before Therefore many people wanted independence

In 1963 Singapore joined with Malaya Sabah and Sarawak to form the new nation of Malaysia Malaysia is a country with many races In Malay only the Malays have special benefits For example the Malays can get university education more easily than other races

As most people in Singapore are Chinese Singapore wanted equality for all the people of Malaysia Singapore also wanted a common market to be set up so that goods to Malaysia would not be taxed However this was not done and caused arguments between the state government of Singapore and the federal government of Malaysia

Singapore separated from Malaysia and became independent on its own on 9 August 1965

After Independence the president of Singapore was Yusof bin Ishak and its prime minister was Lee Kuan Yew At first many people thought Singapore would not be able to continue on its own In 1967 Singapore helped to start the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and in 1970 it joined the Non Aligned Movement Lee Kuan Yew was in charge of the country as Prime Minister of Singapore and saw it become very developed In 1990 Goh Chok Tong replaced Lee Kuan Yew as prime minister while Lee Kuan Yew became Senior Minister When Goh Chok Tong was Prime Minister Singapore went through the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis the 2003 SARS outbreak and terrorist threats by Jemaah Islamiyah In 2004 Lee Hsien Loong the son of Lee Kuan Yew took over as Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong became the Senior Minister and Lee Kuan Yew became the Minister Mentor of Singapore

Singapore is a parliamentary republic with a Westminster system of unicameral parliamentary government representing constituencies Its constitution states representative democracy as its political system Freedom House ranks Singapore as partly free in its Freedom in the World report and The Economist ranks Singapore as a hybrid regime the third rank out of four in its Democracy Index Singapore is ranked regularly as one of the least corrupt countries in the world according to Transparency International

The Cabinet has executive power and is led by the Prime Minister and the President The president is elected through popular vote and has some veto powers for a few big decisions such as the use of the national reserves and the appointment of judges but otherwise occupies a post with little power

The Parliament serves as the legislative branch of government Members of Parliament are made up of elected non constituency and nominated members Elected MPs are voted into parliament on a first past the post system and represent either single member or group representation constituencies The Peoples Action Party has won control of Parliament with large majorities in every election since self governance in 1959 However in the most recent parliamentary elections in 2011 the opposition led by the Workers Party made large and important gains and increased its representation in the House to 6 elected MPs and two nominated MPs

The legal system of Singapore is based on English common law however with large and important local differences Trial by jury was completely removed in 1970 leaving judicial judgement done completely and only by judgeship Singapore has punishments that include judicial corporal punishment in the form of caning for rape rioting vandalism and some immigration crimes There is a mandatory death penalty for murder and for certain drug trafficking and firearms offencesIn a 2008 survey international business executives believed Singapore together with Hong Kong had the best judicial system in Asia

Buddhism is the most common religion in Singapore Other common religions include Christianity Islam Taoism and Hinduism

Students in Singapore go through six years of compulsory Primary school which ends with all students taking a Primary School Leaving Examination Then depending on their results in the PSLE students are streamed into Special Express Normal and Normal groups The amount of time a student spends studying in Secondary school depends on their group

Students are taught in English and their mother tongue which can be Chinese Malay or Tamil Secondary school students may also choose to study a third language

Students can take a third language as it increases their chances in getting an overseas scholarship and can improve their examination grades especially in the GCE Ordinary Level which are Secondary students take after their five or four years of education However only some students can qualify to take a third language

After their O Levels students can choose to go to a polytechnic which is a place where students can study for 3 years for a diploma or to a junior college where students study for 2 years to receive a A Level Students can also go to Institutes of Technical Education where students study for two years to receive a National ITE Certificate This certificate is only recognized in Singapore Students who go to ITE usually continue their education at a polytechnic

With either a diploma or a A Level certificate students can apply to go to Universities in Singapore or overseas

The Singapore government has chosen four official languages English Malay Chinese and Tamil English is the primary language Singapore English is the main language in Singapore 

English is the first language of the nation but it is not the most common English is the second most commonly spoken language among Singaporeans The most commonly spoken language amongst Singaporeans in their homes is Chinese followed by English Malay and Tamil This means that 32 of Singaporeans are native English speakers Most of the rest of the people speak it as a second language However English has the largest total number of speakers including native and second language speakers Mandarin Chinese is the second most common

Almost 40 of people in Singapore are foreign Most foreigners come from Asia The two countries where most foreigners come from are Malaysia and China In 2009 there may have been 350000 Malaysians working in Singapore Many Chinese speaking foreigners and Chinese speaking Singaporeans work in services Thus Chinese is the main language of many workers such as hawkers retail assistants hairdressers etc in Singapore today

Singaporean English mainly comes from British English The forms of English spoken in Singapore range from Standard English to a pidgin called Singlish The Singapore government and many Singaporeans are against using Singlish There is a Speak Good English campaign each year Public schools and in the media also have rules against Singlish There are many Singapore accents in English because of the many languages and identities of people in the city Languages can even change over the generations and children may speak different languages and have different accents from their mother For example in a Singaporean Chinese family the grandmother might speak Hokkien as her first language Differently the mother might speak Mandarin as her first language and HokkienEnglish as her second languages while the grandson might speak English as his first language and Mandarin as his second language

Before independence in 1965 Hokkien a Chinese dialect was the common language among the Chinese laborers Malay and English were used to communicate between the different ethnic groups After independence in 1965 English became the first language of the nation and replaced Hokkien and Malay as the one shared language Today most younger Singaporeans have English as their first language or are fluent in English

Malay is a national language of Singapore because of the history of the city However less than 20 of Singaporeans can read and write in Malay Malay is still used at home by most Singaporean Malays The Malay used in Singapore is closer to the language in Malaysia than the language in Indonesia However there are differences between the Malay in Singapore and in Malaysia The national anthem Majulah Singapura is sung in Malay

Many people speak Chinese Mandarin and other Chinese dialects in Singapore Just over 50 of Singaporeans speak it at home so it is the most common language in homes Singaporean Mandarin is based on simplified Chinese and it is similar to the system used in mainland China The forms of Mandarin spoken in Singapore range from Standard Mandarin to a pidgin known as Singdarin Besides Mandarin many southern Chinese dialects are also spoken in Singapore 

Hokkien used to be a lingua franca among the Singaporean Chinese so many older Singaporeans still understand Hokkien The most common Chinese dialects spoken by Singaporeans are the Hokkien Hainan Teochew and Cantonese However Chinese dialects other than Mandarin are not allowed in the media so these dialects are quickly dying out Most younger Singaporeans do not speak them anymore 

Tamil is spoken by about 60 of Indians in Singapore That is about 5 of all Singaporeans Indian languages such as Malayalam Telugu and Hindi are also spoken by a small group of Singaporean Indians in Singapore

Singapore has many kinds of people and immigrants from many places Therefore Singaporean culture has often been described as a mix of cultures British Malay Chinese Indian and Peranakan Also foreigners are 42 of the population in Singapore and they are part of changing Singaporean culture

Dining is an important part of life in Singapore Singaporean food is an example of the many different cultures in the country It is also an example of mixing among cultures British Chinese Indian Malay Tamil and Indonesian styles of cooking all mix together Typical Singaporean food includes Satay Nasi lemak Chilli crab and Hainanese chicken rice

MediaCorp the state owned media corporation operates all seven local broadcast television channels in Singapore It also runs 13 radio stations of the total 18 radio stations in Singapore Radio and television stations are all owned by government controlled companies However one radio transmitter in Singapore is not controlled by the government That is the Far Eastern Relay Station of the BBC World Service

The national flower of Singapore is Vanda Miss Joaquim It is a type of orchid and it is a hybrid orchid This makes Singapore the only nation in the world to have a hybrid as a national flower It was chosen because it was part of the effort to create national pride and identity

Singapore has a strong and free economy that supports a large middle class The city state is a global shipping and logistics hub and many multinational firms have their offices in Singapore The national airline Singapore Airlines has a large global network which brings tourists and business travelers alike to the city

Singapore also has a port located at the south of Singapore called Keppel Harbour It is one of the busiest ports around the world with many ships coming in to trade in a single day Singapore also has another port on Jurong Island

Singapores currency is the Singapore dollar The short name for the Singapore dollar is SGD Brunei dollar can be used in Singapore because they have the same value

Singapore is made up of List of islands of Singapore63 islands including the main island which is known as Singapore Island to most people but is also known as Pulau Ujong There are two man made connections to Johor Malaysia the JohorSingapore Causeway in the north and the Tuas Second Link in the west Jurong Island Pulau Tekong Pulau Ubin and Sentosa are the largest of Singapores smaller islands The highest natural point is Bukit Timah Hill at convert166mft0abbron

About 23 of Singapores land area are forest and nature reserves Urbanisation has removed most primary rainforest with Bukit Timah Nature Reserve the only significant remaining forest Even though there is very little primary rainforest left there are more than 300 parks and four nature reserves in Singapore There are also many trees planted all over Singapore and almost fifty per cent of the country is covered by trees and plants Because of this Singapore is also commonly known as the Garden City 

Singapore being a small country has been reclaiming land from the sea around the island The first time Singapore started to reclaim land was in the 1960s The total land area of Singapore at that time was 5815 km2 and it has increased to 633 km2 in the 1990s which is a increase of about 9 in total land areaIt is now convert704km2sqmiabbron and may grow by another convert100km2sqmi 1abbron by 2030 Some land reclamation projects involve joining together smaller islands to make larger islands with more uses like Jurong Island Singapore uses the landfill method to reclaim the sea at the south of the country The countrys rapid reclamation projects has made disputes with its neighbouring countries Malaysia and Indonesia

A town is usually a place with a lot of houses but not a city As with cities there is more than one way to say what a town is in different countries

In English we also use the word town as a general word for places with a lot of houses When we say town we are normally thinking of a big important place For example London is a city but people often call it London town Also going from the outside to central London is to go into town

Generally the difference between towns and villages or hamlets is the sort of economy they have People in towns usually get money from industry commerce and public service not agriculture

The number of people who live in a place does not tell us if it is a town or a village In many areas of the world for example India a big village can have many more people than a small town It is also difficult to say if a place is a town because today some towns are becoming bigger and in some places people live in a village or near a town and work in the town 

Sometimes a place is a city because it got the name city by law But people often say it is a town because it is small In the Middle Ages a place became a town by means of a charter which granted it town privileges

In the United States of America the meaning of the term town is different in each state In some states a town is a town if the state says it is In other states for example Wisconsin a town is a town if it has special powers In other states for example Michigan the name town has no official meaning and people use it for any place with a lot of people 

In the six New England states a town is a smaller part of the county and in these states really a more important part than the county In Connecticut and Rhode Island counties are only on the map and have no power In the other four states counties are mostly places with law powers The counties with other functions are mostly in New Hampshire and Vermont In all six towns do things that in most states counties do In many of these towns town meetings are the main form of government so citizens can say what happens where they live by direct democracy

In New York a town is also a smaller part of the county but with less importance than in New England In New York a town gives people more direct power than its county giving almost all town services to places not in towns called hamlets and some services to places in towns called villages In New York a town usually has some hamlets and villages But because villages have power without towns they can be in two towns or even two counties Everyone in New York State who does not live in an Indian reservation or a city lives in a town and perhaps in one of the towns hamlets or villages 

In Virginia a town is similar to a city but it can have a smaller number of people in it By Virginia law cities are independent of counties towns are part of a county

In England and Wales the name city is only for places that have a Royal Charter saying they can have that name In the past cities usually had a cathedral 

English people often think that when a place has a cathedral it must be a city but it is not true today For example Chelmsford is a town but it has a cathedral

In the past a place was usually a town not a village when it had a regular market or fair There are some English villages larger than some small towns

A bag is a kind of container It can hold other things A bag is used for carrying things around It may be made from cloth leather plastic or paper A bag may have one or two handles or a shoulder strap Bags come in different shapes and sizes depending on that they will be used for A small bag that can be carried with a single hand is sometimes called a handbag purse or pocketbook Children can suffocate or stop breathing and die when they put certain kinds of bags over their heads due to having the supply of oxygen cut off 

Gaius Julius Caesar was a military commander politician and author at the end of the Roman Republic

Caesar became a member of the First Triumvirate and when that broke up he fought a civil war against Pompey the Great Winning the war Caesar became Dictator for life of the Roman Republic He was assassinated by his enemies in Rome 

At sixteen he was the head of his family and soon came under threat as Lucius Cornelius Sulla became Dictator 

Sulla set about purging Rome of his enemies Hundreds were killed or exiled and Caesar was on the list His mothers family pleaded for his life Sulla reluctantly gave in but stripped Caesar of his inheritance From then on lack of money was one of the main problems in his life Caesar joined the army and left Rome He only returned after Sullas death in 78 BC

On the way across the Aegean Sea Caesar was kidnapped by pirates and held prisoner He maintained an attitude of superiority throughout his captivity When the pirates thought to demand a ransom of twenty talents of silver he insisted they ask for fifty After the ransom was paid Caesar raised a fleet pursued and captured the pirates and imprisoned them He had them crucified on his own authority as he had promised while in captivitya promise the pirates had taken as a joke As a sign of leniency he first had their throats cut He was soon called back into military action

On his return to Rome he was elected military tribune a first step in a political career He was elected quaestor for 69 BC His wife Cornelia died that year After her funeral Caesar went to serve his quaestorship in Spain On his return in 67 BC he married Pompeia whom he later divorced In 63 BC he ran for election to the post of Pontifex Maximus high priest of the Roman state religion He ran against two powerful senators there were accusations of bribery by all sides Caesar won comfortably despite his opponents greater experience and standing 

After his praetorship Caesar was appointed to govern Roman Spain but he was still in considerable debt and needed to satisfy his creditors He turned to Marcus Licinius Crassus one of Romes richest men In return for political support Crassus paid some of Caesars debts and acted as guarantor for others Caesar left for his province before his praetorship had ended In Spain he conquered two local tribes was hailed as imperator by his troops and completed his governorship in high esteem Though he was due a triumph in Rome he also wanted to stand for Consul the most senior magistracy in the Republic Faced with the choice between a triumph and the consulship Caesar chose the consulship After election he was a consul in 59 BC

Caesar took power with Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus and Marcus Licinius Crassus These three men ruled Rome and were called the Triumvirate 

Caesar was the go between for Crassus and Pompey They had been at odds for years but Caesar tried to reconcile them Between the three of them they had enough money and political influence to control public business This informal alliance known as the First Triumvirate was cemented by the marriage of Pompey to Caesars daughter Julia Caesar also married again this time to Calpurnia who was the daughter of another powerful senator

Caesar proposed a law for the redistribution of public lands to the poor a proposal supported by Pompey by force of arms if need be and by Crassus making the triumvirate public Pompey filled the city with soldiers and the triumvirates opponents were intimidated

With the agreement of his partners Caesar became the governor of Gallia Gaul is the area which is todays Northern Italy Switzerland and France 

Caesar was the commander of the Roman legions during the Gallic War The war was fought on the side of Romes Gallic clients against the Germans who wanted to invade Gaul It was also to extend Romes control of Gaul Caesars conquest of Gaul extended Romes territory to the North Sea In 55 BC he conducted the first Roman invasion of Britain Caesar wrote about this eight year war in his book De Bello Gallico This book written in Latin is an important historical account 

These achievements got him great military power and threatened to eclipse Pompey The balance of power was further upset by the death of Crassus in 53 BC

In 50 BC the Senate led by Pompey ordered Caesar to disband his army and return to Rome because his term as governor had finished Caesar thought he would be prosecuted if he entered Rome without the immunity enjoyed by a magistrate Pompey accused Caesar of insubordination and treason 

Caesar and his army approached Rome and crossed the Rubicon a shallow river in north east Italy in 49 BC It was the point beyond which no army was supposed to go The river marked the boundary between Cisalpine Gaul to the north and Italy proper to the south Crossing the Rubicon caused a civil war Pompey the lawful Consul and his friends fled from Rome as Caesars army approached

Pompey managed to escape before Caesar could break capture him Caesar decided to head for Spain while leaving Italy under the control of Mark Antony Caesar made an astonishing 27 day route march to Spain where he defeated Pompeys lieutenants He then returned east to challenge Pompey in Greece where in July 48 BC at Dyrrhachium Caesar barely avoided a catastrophic defeat He then decisively defeated Pompey at the Battle of Pharsalus later that year

In Rome Caesar was appointed Dictator with Mark Antony as his Master of the Horse Caesar presided over his own election to a second consulship and then after eleven days resigned this dictatorship

In 48 BC he was appointed dictator again only this time for an indefinite period Caesar then pursued Pompey to Egypt where Pompey was soon murdered Caesar then became involved in an Egyptian civil war between the child pharaoh and his sister wife and co regent queen Cleopatra Perhaps as a result of the pharaohs role in Pompeys murder Caesar sided with Cleopatra He is reported to have wept at the sight of Pompeys head which was offered to him by the pharaoh as a gift In any event Caesar defeated the pharaohs forces in 47 BC and installed Cleopatra as ruler 

Caesar and Cleopatra celebrated their victory with a triumphant procession on the Nile in the spring of 47 BC The royal barge was accompanied by 400 additional ships introducing Caesar to the luxurious lifestyle of the Egyptian pharaohs Caesar and Cleopatra never married Roman Law only recognized marriages between two Roman citizens Caesar continued his relationship with Cleopatra throughout his last marriage which lasted 14 years in Roman eyes this did not constitute adultery and may have fathered a son called Caesarion Cleopatra visited Rome on more than one occasion staying in Caesars villa outside Rome across the River Tiber

In 46 BC Caesar was appointed dictator for ten years In two years he made numerous changes in Roman administration to improve the Republic Many of these changes were meant to improve the lives of ordinary people One example which has lasted was his reform of the calendar into the present format with a leap day every four years In February of 44 BC one month before his assassination he was appointed Dictator for life

On the Ides of March of 44 BC Caesar was due to appear at a session of the Senate Mark Antony fearing the worst went to head Caesar off The plotters expected this and arranged for someone to intercept him

Hinduism is thought to be the oldest major world religion that is still practiced today It was the first religion that had the idea of reincarnation The most important thing however is that Hinduism unlike Christianity or Islam is NOT a single religion which have almost the same faith and a unique holy book Actually it is the federation of a number of faiths which have evolved from people who lived in the Indian subcontinent It is a composite mixture of faiths One group accepts varna another declines One group accept vedas another declines One group accepts god another declines god itself But they are all called Hindus According to the Indian constitution the definition for a Hindu is whoever who lives in India and is not a Muslim or a Christian 

Gods energy is Devi the Divine Mother For worshipers of Vishnu who follow Ramunjacharayas philosophy Devi is Lakshmi the Mother of all and who pleads with Vishnu for mankind For worshipers of Shiva Devi is Parvati For Shaktas that is worshipers of Devi Devi is the personal form of God to attain the impersonal Absolute God For them Shiva is personified as God without attributes

Hinduism takes ideas from the Vedas the Upanishads as well as the teachings of many Hindu gurus through the ages Many different types of thought come from six main VedicHindu schools Bhakti sects and Tantric Agamic schools are very common paths within Hinduism

The sexiest Way or the Perennial PhilosophyHarmonyFaith is the one name that has represented Hinduism for thousands of years According to Hindus it speaks the idea that certain spiritual principles are true for all time past man made beliefs representing a pure science of consciousness This consciousness is not just that of the body or mind and intellect but of a soul state above the mind that exists within and beyond our existence the pure Self of all Religion to the Hindu is the search for the divine within the Self the search to find the One truth that really never was lost According to this belief somebody looking for truth will find it no matter who they are Everything that exists from vegetables and animals to mankind are subjects and objects of the eternal Dharma This inner faith therefore is also known as AryaNoble Dharma VedaKnowledge Dharma YogaUnion Dharma Hindu Dharma or simply the Dharma

What can be said to be common to all Hindus is belief in Dharma reincarnation karma and moksha of every soul through a variety of moral action based and meditative yogas Still more basic principles include ahimsa the importance of the Guru the Divine Word of Aum and the power of mantras love of Truth in many manifestations as gods and goddessess and an understanding that the essential spark of the Divine is in every human and living being allowing for many spiritual paths leading to the One Unitary Truth

An example of Hindu spirituality in daily life is the bindi which is a common marker for Hindu women It stands for different things For some it may represent opening a third eye that helps people gain knowledge Hindus all think it is important to learn things through meditating They believe this gives them an intuition beyond the mind and body something often associated with the god Shiva Men too may place a tilak mark on their foreheads usually on religious occasions Its shape may stand for devotion to a certain main god a U shape stands for Vishnu a group of three lines for Shiva It is not uncommon for some to meld both together in an marker signifying Hari Hara

Hinduism tells about a particular way of life to lead as a Hindu This is done by way of Yogas mainly as follows

The way to do all these have been described in the two main texts of Hindu Yoga the Bhagavad Gita and the Yoga Sutras The Upanishads also contain important texts about yoga

Hinduism believes in four main goals of life They are kama artha dharma and moksha It is said that all humans seek kama and artha but soon with maturity learn to govern these legitimate desires within a higher pragmatic framework of dharma or moral harmony in all

In Hinduism life of a human being is divided into four stages These stages are called Ashramas and they are

Little is known about how Hinduism started because it has been around since before history was written down It has been said to have come from what the Aryans believed The hundreds of faith and beliefs of Dravidians and Harappans living in the Indian subcontinent before the Aryans came to India came together under the Hindu name during the British Raj Different ideas of where the Veda come from and understandings of whether or not the Aryans were native or foreign to Indian soil can change estimates of Hinduisms age from 4000 to 6000 years

Historically the word Hindu comes from before Hinduism was thought of as a religion the term is of Persian origin and first referred to people who lived on the other side of the Sindhu or Indus river It was used to refer to not only ethnicity but also the Vedic religion as far back as the 15th and 16th centuries by such figures as Guru Nanak During the British Raj the terms use was made standard and eventually the religion of the Vedic Hindoos was given the name Hinduism In actuality it was merely a new name for a culture that had been around for millennia before

In a 1966 Supreme Court of India said exactly what Hinduism was for the purposes of the law The Courts ruling said what a number of conditions a person had to meet to be a Hindu

The nations of India Mauritius and Nepal as well as the Indonesian island of Bali have more people who are Hindus than people who are not Hindus These countries also have many Hindus

There are also strong Hindu communities in the countries of the ex Soviet Union especially in Russia and Poland The Indonesian islands of Java Sulawesi Sumatra and Borneo also have big native Hindu populations In its Yoga stream Hinduism is even more widespread all over the world with 30 million Hindus in the United States alone

According to one view the caste system shows how strongly many have felt about each person following his or her dharma or destined path Many Hindus say it goes against the true meaning of dharma However caste plays a big role in Hindu society although it is now losing favor and is illegal in India

In early Vedic periods the Brahmins began not letting young candidates become priests if they were in a lower caste This became more part of the culture over centuries until it became almost impossible to move up into a higher caste Even though people had tried to change things for years caste is so much of a part of in Indian culture that even people who convert to Christianity have been known to have different church meetings for different castes

The six Astika or orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy are Nyaya Vaisheshika Samkhya Yoga Purva Mimamsa and Uttara Mimamsa The non Vedic schools are called Nastika or heterodox and refer to Buddhism Jainism and Lokayata The schools that continue to affect Hinduism today are Purva Mimamsa Yoga and Vedanta See Hindu philosophy for a discussion of the historical significance of Samkhya Nyaya and Vaisheshika

The main purpose of the Purva Mimamsa line of thought was to make the Vedas more of a part of life and led to people understanding it better Adi Shankara and Swami Vivekananda followed this line of thought to explain the meaning of Hindu beliefs

The Yoga system is thought to have come from the Samkhya philosophy The yoga referred to here however is specifically Raja Yoga It is based on the sage Patanjalis text called the Yoga Sutra which is about the Yoga philosophy that came before Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita are also important writings in the study of Yoga

The Uttara Mimamsa school is perhaps one of the cornerstone movements of Hinduism and certainly was responsible for a new wave of philosophical and meditative inquiry renewal of faith and cultural reform Primarily associated with the Upanishads and their commentary by Badarayana the Vedanta Sutras Vedanta thought split into three groups initiated by the thinking and writing of Adi Shankara Most Hindu thought today in some way relates to changes affected by Vedantic thought which focused on meditation morality and centeredness on the one Self rather than on rituals and meaningless societal distinctions like caste See Vedanta for greater depth

Advaita literally means not two thus this is what we refer to as a monistic system which emphasises oneness Its consolidator was Adi Shankara expounded his theories largely based on previous teachings of the Upanishads and his own guru Govinda Bhagavadpada 

By analysis of experiential consciousness he exposed the relative nature of the world and established the non dual reality of Brahman in which Atman and Brahman are identified absolutely It is not merely philosophy but a conscious system of applied ethics and meditation all geared towards attaining peace and understanding of truth 

Adi Shankara denounced caste and meaningless ritual as foolish and in his own charismatic manner exhorted the true devotee to meditate on Gods love and apprehend truth 

See Advaita Vedanta for more

Ramanuja was the foremost proponent of the concept of Sriman Narayana as the supreme Brahman He taught that Ultimate reality had three aspects Isvara cit and acit Vishnu is the only independent reality while souls and matter are dependent on God for their existence Because of this qualification of Ultimate reality Ramanujas system is known as qualified non dualism

Like Ramanuja Madhvacharya identified god with Vishnu but his view of reality was purely dualistic in that he understood a fundamental differentiation between the ultimate godhead and the individual soul and the system is therefore called Dvaita Vedanta

Puja takes place in the Mandir Mandirs vary in size from small village shrines to large buildings surrounded by walls People can also visit the Mandir at any time to pray and participate in the bhajans Hindus also worship at home and often have a special room with a shrine to particular gods

Temple construction in India started nearly 2000 years ago The oldest temples that were built of brick and wood no longer exist Stone later became the preferred material Temples marked the transition of Hinduism from the Vedic religion of ritual sacrifices to a religion of Bhakti or love and devotion to a personal deity Temple construction and mode of worship is governed by ancient Sanskrit scriptures called agamas of which there are several which deal with individual deities There are substantial differences in architecture customs rituals and traditions in temples in different parts of India During the ritual consecration of a temple the presence of the universal all encompassing Brahman is invoked into the main stone deity of the temple through ritual thereby making the deity and the temple sacred and divine

The Bhakti school takes its name from the Hindu term that signifies a blissful selfless and overwhelming love of God as the beloved Father Mother Child or whatever relationship finds appeal in the devotees heart The philosophy of Bhakti seeks to tap into the universal divinity through personal form which explains the proliferation of so many gods and goddesses in India often reflecting the singular inclinations of small regions or groups of people Seen as a form of Yoga or union it seeks to dissolve the ego in God since consciousness of the body and limited mind as self is seen to be a divisive factor in spiritual realization Essentially it is God who effects all change who is the source of all works who acts through the devotee as love and light Sins and evil doings of the devotee are said to fall away of their own accord the devotee shriven limitedness even transcended through the love of God The Bhakti movements rejuvenated Hinduism through their intense expression of faith and their responsiveness to the emotional and philosophical needs of India They can rightly be said to have affected the greatest wave of change in Hindu prayer and ritual since ancient times

The most popular means of expressing love for God in the Hindu tradition has been through puja or ritual devotion frequently using the aid of a murti in conjunction with the singing or chanting of meditational prayer in the form of mantras 

Devotional songs called bhajans kirtan and arti are sometimes sung in conjunction with performance of puja This rather organic system of devotion attempts to aid the individual in connecting with God through symbolic medium It is said however that the bhakta through a growing connection with God is eventually able to eschew all external form and is immersed entirely in the bliss of undifferentiated Love in Truth

Altogether bhakti resulted in a mass of devotional literature music and art that has enriched the world and gave India renewed spiritual impetus one eschewing unnecessary ritual and artificial social boundaries See bhakti yoga for more

According to the most famous Western Tantrik scholar Sir John Woodroffe The Indian Tantras which are numerous constitute the Scripture of the Kaliyuga and as such are the voluminous source of present and practical orthodox Hinduism The Tantra Shastra is in fact and whatever be its historical origin a development of the Vaidika Karmakanda promulgated to meet the needs of that age Shiva says For the benefit of men of the Kali age men bereft of energy and dependent for existence on the food they eat the Kaula doctrine O auspicious one is given To the Tantra we must therefore look if we would understand aright both ritual yoga and sadhana of all kinds as also the general principles of which these practices are but the objective expression

The word tantra means treatise or continuum and is applied to a variety of mystical occult medical and scientific works as well as to those which we would now regard as tantric Most tantras were written in the late Middle Ages and sprang from Hindu cosmology and Yoga

Many Hindus are vegetarians because of their respect for life About 30 of todays Hindu population especially in orthodox communities in South India in certain northerly states like Gujurat and in many Brahmin areas around the subcontinent are vegetarian 

Most Hindus who do eat meat do not eat beef Some do not even use leather products This is most likely because many Hindus have relied so heavily on the cow for all sorts of dairy products tilling of fields and fuel for fertiliser that its status as a willing caretaker of humanity grew to identifying it as an almost motherly figure Thus while most Hindus do not worship the cow and rules against eating beef arose long after the Vedas had been written it still has an honored place in Hindu society It is said that Krishna is both Govinda and Gopala and Shivas attendant is Nandi the bull With the stress on vegetarianism and the sacred nature of the cow it is no wonder that most holy cities and areas in India have a ban on selling meat products and there is a movement among Hindus to ban cow slaughter not only in specific regions but in all of India

Hindus use many symbols and signs The two most important symbols used by Hindus are the Aum and the Swastika

Contrary to popular belief practiced Hinduism is neither polytheistic nor strictly monotheistic The various Hindu gods and avatars that are worshipped by Hindus are understood as different forms of One truth sometimes seen as beyond a mere god and as a formless Divine Ground akin but not limited to monism or as one monotheistic principle like Vishnu or Shiva

Whether believing in the One source as formless or as a personal god Hindus understand that the one truth may be seen as different to different people Hinduism encourages devotees to describe and develop a personal relationship with their chosen deity in the form of a god or goddess

While some censuses hold worshippers of one form or another of Vishnu to be at 80 and those of Shiva and Shakti at the remaining 20 such figures are perhaps misleading The vast majority of Hindus worship many gods as varicolored forms of the same prism of Truth Among the most popular are Vishnu Shiva Devi Ganesha Skanda and Hanuman

Worship of the said deities is often done through the aid of pictures or icons which are said not to be God themselves but conduits for the devotees consciousness markers for the human soul that signify the ineffable and illimitable nature of the love and grandeur of God They are symbols of the greater principle representing and are never presumed to be the concept or entity itself Thus Hindu image worship is a form of iconolatry in which the symbols are venerated as putative sigils of divinity as opposed to idolatry a charge often levied at Hindus For more details on this form of worship see murti

Hindus use several prayers and group of words Some group of words are called mantras These words are said to give the speaker a deeper concentration and understanding thus coming closer to Brahman A well known mantra is om or aum It symbolizes Brahman and is often the opening word in many prayers To pronounce a mantra well you should say it slowly and in a deep voice

There are many texts relating to Hinduism Most of them have been written in Sanskrit These texts are called Hindu scriptures Some of the important Hindu texts are

The Vedas are considered scripture by all Hindus While most Hindus may never read the Vedas they strongly believe that the search for eternal knowledge is important Classed with the Vedas are their famous commentaries the Upanishads 

The post Vedic Hindu scriptures form the latter category the most notable of which are the Mahabharata and the Ramayana major epics considered scripture by most followers of Sanatana Dharma their stories arguably familiar to the vast majoriy of Hindus living in the Indian subcontinent if not in other places also Other texts considered important by todays Hindus include the Devi Mahatmya an ode to Devi the Divine Mother and the Yoga Sutras a key meditative yoga text of Shri Patanjali There are also a number of revered Hindu Tantras and Sutras that command the respect of various Hindu sects of different persuasion some including the Mahanirvana Tantra Tirumantiram and Shiva Sutras

Bible study is intensive reading of the Bible

For Christians study of the Bible is often part of daily life A lot of other people are also interested in this piece of world literature

In Europe before the 16th century it was not possible for most people to study the Bible Books were written using only the languages Latin and Greek Only people who had learned to read those languages could study the Bible The Roman Catholic Church said people could not translate the Bible into other languages for example Italian or English because many people could not read and it took the lifetime of a monk by himself to translate the Bible 

When the Reformation started in 16th century Europe the Bible was translated into several languages Many books were printed in these languages People were then able to read the Bible in their own language

The medlar is a tree and the name of the fruit of this tree Its Latin name is Mespilus germanicus or German medlar but it is not from Germany It grows in the Near East and South Eastern Europe and the Romans took it to Germany Near the Caspian Sea people grew the medlar about three thousand years ago It came to Greece in about 700 BC and to Rome in about 200 BC It was an important fruit plant in Roman and medieval times But by 1600 1700 people started eating other fruits and not the medlar Today people do not grow it very often 

The medlar needs warm summers and mild winters and likes to grow in sunny dry places In the best places the plant can grow up to eight metres tall The medlar is deciduous it is not green all year Usually it is shorter than a tree It lives thirty to fifty years quite a short time Medlar leaves are dark green maximum fifteen centimetres long and three centimetres wide The plant has flowers in May and June The flowers are white The red brown medlar fruits are similar to apples and grow to two to three centimetres They are very hard and acidic and we can only eat them after the cold weather makes them soft

Atheism is about not believing any god or gods exist It is the opposite of theism which is the belief that at least one god exists A person who rejects belief in gods is called an atheist 

Atheism is not the same as agnosticism Agnostics say that there is no way to know whether gods exist or not but they may still believe in one or more gods A person may believe in a god by faith but still accept the philosophical position of agnosticism The theologian Kierkegaard is an example

Atheists often give reasons why they do not believe in a god or gods Three of the reasons that they often give are the problem of evil the argument from inconsistent revelations and the argument from nonbelief

The word atheism comes from the Greek language It can be divided into a a Greek prefix meaning without and theos meaning god and recombined to form without gods or godless In ancient Greece it also meant impious Starting in about the 5th century BC the word came to describe people who were actively severing relations with the gods or denying the gods Before that time the meaning had been closer to  or impious In modern times the word atheos in classical texts is sometimes translated as atheistic There is also the abstract noun atheism 

Cicero transliterated the Greek word into the Latin atheos This word was often used in the debate between early Christians and Hellenists Each side used it to label the other in a bad way

The English word atheism comes from the French wiktathismeathisme The word entered the language in the 16th century about 1587 The term atheist in the sense of one who denies or disbelieves the existence of God is older than atheism in English It was first mentioned about 1571 Atheist as a label of practical godlessness was used at least as early as 1577 Related words were created later deist in 1621 theist in 1662 theism in 1678 and deism in 1682 Deism and theism changed meanings slightly around 1700  they were influenced by atheism Deism was originally used as a synonym for todays theism but came to denote a separate philosophical doctrine

Karen Armstrong writes that During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the word atheist was still reserved exclusively for polemic The term atheist was an insult Nobody would have dreamed of calling himself an atheist Atheism was first used to describe an openly positive belief in late 18th century Europe specifically denoting disbelief in the monotheistic Abrahamic god In the 20th century globalization contributed to the expansion of the term to refer to disbelief in all deities though it remains common in Western society to describe atheism as simply disbelief in God

In many places it is a crime to be make public the idea of atheism Examples would be to claim the Bible could not be true or to speak or write that there is no god Many countries still have laws against atheism Atheism is becoming more common In some countries such as the United Kingdom Canada the Netherlands and the United States there are laws that protect atheists right to express their atheistic belief This means that atheists have the same rights under the law as everyone else Freedom of religion in international law and treaties includes the freedom to not have a religion

Today about 23 of the worlds population describes itself as atheist About 119 is described as nontheist Between 64 and 65 of Japanese describe themselves as atheists agnostics or non believers and up to 48 in Russia The percentage of such people in European Union member states ranges between 6 and 85

People disagree how atheism should be defined The main points of disagreement are whether someone who does not believe in one of the main world religions is an atheist and whether people who do not practise their religion can be called atheists

Atheism has sometimes been defined to include the simple absence of belief that any deities exist This definition is very general and includes people who have never heard about theistic ideas 

As far back as 1772 Baron dHolbach said that All children are born Atheists they have no idea of God Similarly George H Smith suggested that The man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god This category would also include the child who is able to grasp the issues involved but who is still unaware of those issues The fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist Smith coined the term implicit atheism to refer to the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it and explicit atheism to refer to the more common definition of conscious disbelief

Ernest Nagel contradicts Smiths definition of atheism as merely absence of theism acknowledging only explicit atheism as true atheism

Philosophers such as Antony Flew Michael Martin and William L Rowe have looked at strong atheism against weak atheism Strong atheism is the sure belief that no god exists Weak atheism is all other forms of not believing in a god or gods According to this idea anyone who does not believe in a god is either a weak or a strong atheist The terms weak and strong are quite recent the terms negative and positive are older They have been used more often in philosophical writing and in Catholic beliefs since at least 1813 Under this definition of atheism most agnostics are weak atheists

According to Martin agnosticism includes weak atheism Most agnostics disagree they think their view is different from atheism In their view atheism is no different from believing in a god because both require belief 

Agnostics say that it cannot be known if a god or gods exist In their view strong atheism requires a leap of faith The mathematician W K Clifford wrote an essay called The Ethics of Belief In this essay Clifford shows some examples how people can believe in things which go against what they see or feel One of these examples is that of a shipowner who transports emigrants The emigrants have to pay to be able to go on the ship The ship is old and in a bad state it needs to be fixed badly At first the shipowner thought about fixing the ship even though that this would cost a lot of money Before the ship sails he can overcome these doubts by telling himself that the ship has safely made many trips and survived many storms before so it would also be good for this trip so his fear is unfounded Unfortunately the ship sinks and all die The shipowner is greedy and takes the money the insurance pays for the ship According to Clifford the shipowner did something that is wrong when he made himself believe there were no problems with the ship he did so out of greed Even if the ship had made its trip safely the shipowner would have done something that is wrong According to Clifford it is always wrong to believe on insufficient grounds

Atheists commonly reply to this that there is no difference between an unproven idea about religion and one about other things and that the lack of proof that gods do not exist does not mean that any do any more than it means that any do not Scottish philosopher J J C Smart says that sometimes a person who is really an atheist may describe herself even passionately as an agnostic because of unreasonable generalised philosophical skepticism which would preclude us from saying that we know anything whatever except perhaps the truths of mathematics and formal logic So some popular atheist authors such as Richard Dawkins prefer to show the difference between theist agnostic and atheist positions by the probability assigned to the statement God exists

In everyday life many people define natural phenomena without the need of a god or gods They do not deny the existence of one or more gods they simply say that this existence is not necessary Gods do not provide a purpose to life nor influence it according to this view Many scientists practice what they call methodological naturalism They silently adopt philosophical naturalism and use the scientific method Their belief in a god does not affect their results

Practical atheism can take different forms

Theoretic atheism tries to find arguments against the existence of god and to disprove the arguments of Theism such as the argument from design or Pascals Wager These theoretical reasons have many forms most of them are ontological or epistemological Some rely on psychology or sociology

According to Immanuel Kant there can be no proof of a supreme being that is made using reason In his work Critique of pure reason he tries to show that all attempts of either proving the existence of God or disproving it end in a logical contradictions Kant says that it is impossible to know whether there are any higher beings This makes him an agnostic

Ludwig Feuerbach published The Essence of Christianity in 1841 In his work he postulates the following

The following phrases sum up Feuerbachs writing

Hippocrates was a Greek doctor He was probably born in 460 BC and died in 377 BC

Hippocrates is called the father of medicine He was the first person to write that people got sick for scientific reasons People used to believe disease was caused by angry gods

Hippocrates wrote about treating sick people His writings are still important to doctors today He said many ideas that doctors still study An idea he wrote about is patient confidentiality This means that doctors cannot tell anyone else what their patients tell them Another idea is that the doctor cannot do anything to kill a patient These kinds of ideas are part of medical ethics

The Hippocratic Oath is named after him This is a promise or oath doctors say This means they say they will do what is said in the Hippocratic Oath

Most medical schools today use a new version This means that some things are changed But the important ideas are the same

This is an example of a modern Hippocratic Oath This is used today at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine

I do solemnly swear by all I hold most sacred

Incommensurability is the idea that it is possible to see the world in multiple ways and that there is not a fair method to see which way is right Some people think that it is possible that scientific traditions can be incommensurable it is not really possible to say which one is right This idea has been defended by Thomas Kuhn He wrote when paradigms change the world changes with them Paul Feyerabend was another philosopher who said that incommensurability was possible in scientific topics He wrote that it is important to remember this because it means that it is possible to say things that are not scientific but also not wrong

So put in plainer English it means that two theories or even opinions are not comparable because they are in context with different people or situations and cannot be applied in both scenarios

Harvest means to collect what has been planted and grown in the ground It is usually done by farmers and in the fall season This is also called picking crops

It can also mean to collect other things than plants such as cultivated bivalves including oysters and scallops

ELISPOT stands for Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Spot Assay This is a laboratory technique for detecting biological cells that generate various substances These substances can include specific types of cytokines or antibodies The ELISPOT method is typically used with blood cells and is a helpful tool in studying the human immune system and various treatments for disease

In the ELISPOT technique tiny wells are used to contain the cells along with a variety of other substances The substances cause colored spots to form in the vicinity of the cells that secrete the substances in question  These spots can then be counted manually or automatically using specialized equipment with computer vision capabilities

The ELISPOT technique is very sensitive and can detect even a single substance producing cell It is also very versatile since it can be tailored to detect a wide variety of very specific secretions

The Aztecs were Native American people who lived in Mexico The Aztec Empire lasted from the 14th to the 16th century They called themselves Mexicans or Nahua The Aztecs spoke the language of Nhuatl Some parts of the Aztec culture used human sacrifices and the belief in mythical creatures The Aztecs had an extremely accurate calendar which consisted of 365 days They also had a religious calendar which was made up of 260 days They played 1 main sport which was called Tlachtili a game played using rubber balls and vertical hoops on opposite walls in the middle of the court The objective of the game was to shoot the ball into the hoop using your knees and the first team to score won the match

The Aztec capital was Tenochtitlan built on an island in ancient Lake Texcoco Tenochtitlan was one of the greatest cities of the world in that time

The Aztecs believed in several gods Quetzalcoatl Huitzilopochtli and Tezcatlipoca were the most important ones The Aztecs believed that the gods had created them and sacrifice was the most powerful way of giving back the gift of life The Aztecs also believed that the gods were in an almost eternal struggle The hearts and blood from the sacrifice fed the good gods to give them strength to fight the evil gods Sometimes the Aztecs killed humans because they wanted to please their gods Between 1519 and 1521 the Spanish leader Hernn Corts defeated the Aztecs and took their empire Some Aztecs did not want to fight against the soldiers of Corts because they thought they were gods

The Aztecs ate a lot of plants and vegetables that could be grown easily on the Mexican area The main food that they ate was corn which they called maize Another food that they ate was squash In the Aztecs market they sold fruit vegetable spices flowers edible dogs birds and cocoa beans

Aztec social structure was a hierarchy divided into five levels At the top was the Emperor also known as the leader of the Aztecs Underneath that level were the nobility and the priests These people made up about 15 percent of the population and had most of the power and riches All of these people were in the noble class The rest of the people were the merchants artisans soldiers farmers fishers women and slaves They were also known as the commoners Merchants traded goods for the Empire Farmers grew crops artisans made craftworks with feathers such as headdresses tunics and fans Slaves did what they were told to do by their owners People of the Aztec group were allowed to move into a higher level in the social structure with their own work and effort

Aztecs also had a lot of harsh punishments for crimes that seem simple to us now For the following crimes the punishment was death adultery wearing cotton clothes cutting down a living tree moving a field boundary making your land bigger making someone elses smaller major theft and treason They also created chocolate but their version was just a strong liquid that today you wouldnt call tasty

Today many Mexicans have Aztec and other Native American forefathers People still use Aztec symbols in Mexico On the Mexican flag there is a picture of an eagle on a cactus with a snake in its mouth This was an Aztec symbol Also the name Mexico is an Aztec word

The word billion and its matching words in other languages can mean one of two different numbers

Richard Milhous Nixon was the 37th President of the United States and the only president to resign from office

Nixon was born in 1913 in his familys home in Yorba Linda California and was raised as a Quaker Herbert Hoover was the only other United States President to belong to the Quaker faith Nixon was raised in Whittier California and went to school at Whittier High School Whittier College and Duke University He served in the Navy during World War II Later he got married and had 2 daughters

Nixon was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946 When in the House he was a member of House Un American Activities Commission a group of Congressmen that tried to expose people in the United States who might have been Communists

He was later elected a Senator in 1950 after running a controversial campaign against Helen Gahagan Douglas

In the 1952 presidential election Dwight D Eisenhower selected Nixon to be vice president People accused him of receiving illegal money contributions to his campaign and some people wanted Eisenhower to pick a different vice president but Eisenhower still kept Nixon Nixon after the accuasations made a speech saying that no matter what people accuse him of illegally receiving during the campaign he is still going to keep one campaign gift his dog named Checkers

The Republican Party decided to keep Nixon as their vice presidential candidate and when Eisenhower won the election Nixon became vice president of the United States from 1953 to 1961 During his vice presidency he was very busy and traveled across the world to places like South America While he was vice president he went to the Soviet Union and had a debate with the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev They were both arguing that their country was better

In the presidential election of 1960 he ran against Democrat John F Kennedy Kennedy was expected to win at first but as Election Day came closer and closer Nixon was catching up In the end Kennedy won but it was a very close election

In 1962 Nixon lost the election for governor of California to Pat Brown After losing Nixon said You wont have Dick Nixon to kick around anymore leading many experts to say that Nixons political career was over

In 1968 Richard Nixon defeated Hubert Humphrey in the presidential election and became president of the United States in 1969

Nixon took over the Vietnam War from Lyndon Johnson and continued it with the strategy of slowly withdrawing US troops so that the South Vietnamese troops could take over the fighting by themselves Nixon secretly bombed many enemy targets in Cambodia and North Vietnam while bringing home the American troops to make it easier for South Vietnam to win 

Nixon was very successful in diplomacy He began a policy called detente which reduced tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union The two countries would get along and sign treaties that would limit the production of nuclear weapons between both sides Nixon traveled to communist China and established a very good relationship with them Before that there was almost no relationship between the United States and China It opened up the door for decades of trade in the future which is why many items in the United States were made in China His diplomacy with China is seen as one of his greatest accomplishments Later under President Carter the US broke relations with the Republic of China and recognized communist China not Taiwan as the legal government of China

At home Nixon put many reforms into law He created the Department of Environmental Protection supported anti drug laws supported anti crime laws and supported anti discrimination laws When inflation was high he ordered that prices should be frozen for 90 days Although he was known as a conservative Republican before he became president while he was President he supported some of the liberal ideas that Democrats supported In 1974 Nixon made a speech that outlined a plan for universal health care

Nixon was re elected by a landslide in 1972 with most Americans approving of him but soon after Nixons reputation would be destroyed and most Americans would disapprove of him Due to a scandal called Watergate during which Nixon attempted to protect men to burglarize the Democratic National Headquarters Congress was going to put him on trial in a process called impeachment Nixon tried to cover up the scandal but eventually the Supreme Court ordered him to send his taped conversations to them Alexander Haig thought Nixon would be convicted and kicked out of office To prevent this Nixon resigned the Presidency in 1974

Nixons second vice president Gerald Ford gave Nixon a pardon of any crimes Nixon committed during Watergate Ford wanted to end the crisis as quickly as possible because the nation faced more important problems Many people blamed Ford for letting Nixon go unpunished and voted against him when he ran in the 1976 election

Nixons public image never recovered but he remained as a consultant to later Presidents and to other people in government and the media His memoirs were considered important reading His work in negotiating with China in the early 1970s was praised for improving relations between his country and theirs Nixon died of a stroke in 1994 about a year after his wife Pat died The house where he was born is now part of the Richard M Nixon Presidential Library and Museum He was buried at the library

Gerald Rudolph Ford was the 38th President of the United States He is the only president who has not been elected to the office of either President or Vice President He was from the state of Michigan but he lived his later years in California where he died

Ford served 25 years in the United States House of Representatives and was Minority Leader for many years When Richard Nixon was President his first Vice President was Spiro Agnew but Agnew resigned in 1973 because he took bribes while he was Governor of Maryland in the late 1960s Nixon then chose Ford to be his next Vice President Ford had to be approved by Congress since there was no Presidential election that year Because he had been in Congress for a long time other Congressmen knew him well and were happy to approve him as Vice President because they thought he was honest

However Ford was not Nixons first choice Some of his first choices were John Connally Nelson Rockefeller and Ronald Reagan But Nixon was worried that these other men might have trouble getting approved by Congress All of them had also run for President already or were planning to run soon Nixon did not want to help pick who would be the top Republican candidate in 1976 and Ford promised him that he was not interested in being President Ford always told reporters that he always dreamed of being Speaker of the House instead

Because of the Watergate scandal Nixon resigned on August 8 1974 Ford became the President He is the only President of the United States not to be elected to either the office of President or Vice President Once he became President he realized he could do a good job and decided to run for a full term in 1976

Ford had pardoned Nixon for his crimes in 1974 Many experts say that is one of the reasons why Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in the 1976 election which was very close Other reasons for the loss were a bad economy with a lot of inflation the Mayagez incident and the last US soldiers leaving Vietnam followed by Saigon and the rest of South Vietnam being taken over by the North Vietnamese both in 1975

Ford was adopted at a young age His birth name was Leslie King Jr

Ford died in his home in California on December 26 2006 at the age of 93 years and 165 days No other president ever has lived to be that old 

John Forbes Kerry is a Senator from Massachusetts and the Democratic nominee for President in 2004 He lost to George W Bush He has served in the senate for 23 years and has also served as the lieutenant governor of Massachusetts under Michael Dukakis Kerry is married to Teresa Heinz Kerry

Kerrys vice presidential candidate was John Edwards The ticket lost the election to George W Bush and Dick Cheney One of the reasons Kerry lost is because people said he was an elitist and also because a group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth attacked his service in Vietnam

The purpose of white blood cells is to fight infections and cancer They also remove poison waste and damaged cells from the body

The number of white blood cells increases when a person is fighting infection or disease and decrease when a person is healthy The white blood cell is very important Without them a person would not be able to live 

Lymphocytes are round white blood cells a bit bigger than a red blood cell Their center is round and they have little cytoplasm Part of the lymphatic system these target specific germs or poisons using their antibodies There are three known types of lymphocytes called T cells B cells and Natural Killer cells

Monocytes are reserve cells which turn into macrophages and dendritic cells which work together in tissues to fight disease Monocytes have a kidney bean shaped center and lots of cytoplasm They may appear as macrophages in a non round shape when they pass through tissue to eat germs junk cells and dead cells

The next three types of white blood cells are referred to as granulocytes since they all contain rough grain like particles that assist in attacking viruses and bacteria Granulocytes are also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes because of the shape of the nucleus which has three segments 

Neutrophils are the most abundant type of white blood cells in mammals 70 of leukocytes They are an essential part of the immune system They get to the site of an injury within minutes and make up much of the content of pus They have a short life span of a couple of days

The nucleus which looks like a string of beads does not take up stain strongly Like phagocytes they actually eat the bacteria and dead cells They also release a bunch of proteins which work to damage the bacteria

Basophils are rare granulocytes making up only 01 to 03 of leukocytes The nucleus is hidden by granules which turn dark blue in color when stained Basophils carry histamine and heparin and other protein chemicals They appear at the sites of ectoparasite infection or allergies Exactly how they operate is not yet clear

Eosinophils or less commonly acidophils are leukocytes that are one of the immune system components which combat parasites and certain infections Along with mast cells they work on allergy and asthma Eosinophils are round cells with a lobed nucleus and granules which turn red when stained These granules are protein chemicals that can be poured out to help destroy invaders

A special test called a Differential count shows how many white blood cells there are in a persons body and can also tell a doctor how much of each type are in there These are used to show what a persons body is currently fighting if it is fighting anything at all

Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell They help an organism to fight infections They occur in the immune system of all vertebrates 

Lymphocytes can be divided into two types

 Types 

Natural killer cells are a part of the immune system a person is born with They protect the organism from tumours and from cells infected by viruses Natural killer cells are made active by chemicals released by damaged cells called interferons

Natural killer cells can tell the difference between infected cells tumours and normal cells They recognise changes in the level of a surface molecule called MHC class I 

The NK cells then release cytotoxic granules which then destroy the altered cells 

T cells and B cells are the main cells of the adaptive immune response They tackle infections and they cause the immune system to remember the event

The function of T cells and B cells is to recognize foreign antigens Antigens are surface molecules on a cell Once they have identified an invader the cells respond to remove pathogens or pathogen infected cells 

B cells respond to pathogens by producing large numbers of antibodies which then destroy foreign objects like bacteria and viruses 

Some T cells called T helper cells produce cytokines that direct the immune response Cytokines signal to other immune cells that there is a foreign antigen present Other T cells called cytotoxic T cells produce toxic granules which cause the death of infected cells 

Once they are made active B cells and T cells produce memory cells Throughout the lifetime of an animal these cells will remember each specific pathogen encountered and are able to make a strong response if the pathogen is detected again Memory cells live a long time in the body and are how vaccinations work

Mammalian stem cells change or differentiate into several kinds of blood cell within the bone marrow This process is called haematopoiesis All lymphocytes come from a common basic lymphocyte cell before differentiating into their distinct lymphocyte types 

B cells mature into B lymphocytes in the bone marrow while T cells migrate to and mature in a distinct organ called the thymus After they mature the lymphocytes enter the circulation and lymphoid organs where they are able to sense invading pathogens and tumour cells

In the circulatory system they move from lymph node to lymph node This contrasts with macrophages which are rather stationary in the nodes

When white blood cells are counted the lymphocyte count is the percentage of lymphocytes present

An increase in lymphocyte concentration is usually a sign of a viral infection 

A low normal to low absolute lymphocyte count is found with infections after surgery or trauma

Human immunodeficiency virus infects and destroys T cells Without the key defence that these T cells provide the body becomes prone to infections that otherwise would not affect healthy people 

The extent of HIV progression is found by measuring the percentage of CD4 T cells in the patients blood The effects of other virus or lymphocyte disorders can also often be estimated by counting the numbers of lymphocytes present in the blood

An author is a person who writes a book story poem or other written work Their writing can be truth or fiction short or long Often author is a word for a person whose job is to write

Sometimes a person who creates something but is not a writer is called an author Someone who writes music may be called the author of that piece of music though we would usually call that person a composer The French word for author Auteur is another name for the director of a movie 

In biology the first person to write an article that gives a name to and describes a type of living thing is the author of that name 

Pedipalps are the two feelers on a spiders face Some spiders seem to have ten legs and not eight because these pedipalps look like an extra pair of legs But the pedipalps are more similar to arms Spiders often use these to hold small animals for them to eat

Male spiders also use pedipalps for mating for making baby spiders The male spiders put sperm onto a piece of web and then put their pedipalps into the sperm The pedipalps then hold the sperm and the spider can use it to mate with a female

In chemistry an ionic compound is a compound made of ions They have strong ionic bonds between particles The ions join together because they have different charges They are made when two or more atoms come close together and an electron goes from one atom to the other atom The electron does this because both atoms want a full outer shell

The ELISA method is a technique used in biochemistry to determine if a certain substance such as a specific cytokine or antigen is present within a sample It is sometimes abbreviated as EIA

This technique uses special antibodies that attach themselves to the substance These antibodies generate a specific color The amount of color indicates the amount of substance present

Another set of antibodies are used to capture the substance These antibodies adhere to both the substance and the testing container thus holding the substance in place

A more sophisticated and sensitive technique the ELISPOT method was derived from the ELISA techique

David Hume was a philosopher and historian from Scotland When he was still alive people thought of him as a historian He wrote a series of large books called The History of England But today people think of Hume as an important philosopher

In his books on philosophy Hume said that many of our beliefs do not come from reason Instead they come from our instincts or feelings For example reason does not tell us that one thing causes another Instead we see one thing and then we see another and we feel a link between the two Similarly reason does not tell us that someone is a good person Instead we see that the person is kind and friendly and we feel a special moral feeling Because Hume thought that these beliefs do not come from reason people call him a skeptical or anti rationalist philosopher

Hume was also skeptical about religion He was not a religious person and religious people did not like his opinions He did not believe in miracles He said that suicide was sometimes OK But Hume never said if he believed in God In 1776 when he was dying he was very nice to his friends and very calm about death Many people were amazed about this because they thought Hume was going to hell Today Humes books are very important to philosophers who are interested in religion

Todays philosophers sometimes use the term Humes fork to refer to Hume calling everything we can think about either a relation of ideas or a matter of fact

Another philosopher Immanuel Kant read some of Humes books and changed his mind about some important things Kant said Hume had made him wake up from a sleeping dogmatism the traditional metaphysics

Here are Humes most important books

A bath or bathtub is a thing people sit in when washing to wash their body The bath is usually in the bathroom A less common name for a bath is a washtub

In the UK a bath is also a place where people can sit in water for their health This is where the town name Bath comes from

A brush can be a lot of different things All brushes have a long part at one end to hold and hairs or bristles on the other end and we use them for cleaning making hair look good or painting 

There are a lot of sorts of brushes for cleaning for example toothbrushes or brushes for cleaning the floor

We use paint brushes for putting ink or paint on paper In computer software there are sometimes ditigal paintbrushes for making pictures too

Paint brushes can have three shapes

We can buy brushes in different sizes and materials Here are some sorts

The sizes of brushes used for painting and decorating are usually in mm or inches This shows how wide the head is 

Here are some sizes

We can buy brushes with natural or synthetic bristles Handles may be wood or plastic

Artists brushes usually have sizes with numbers but there is no standard

From smallest to largest the sizes are 

We use sizes 000 to 20 most often

Bristles may be natural  either soft hair or hog bristle  or synthetic

Artists brush handles are often wooden but the cheapest brushes may have plastic handles Many cheap handles are made of unfinished wood better quality handles are of finished wood

Starch is a complex carbohydrate Pasta potatoes and other starchy foods are made out of carbohydrates It is made of lots of sugars Plants use it to keep energy

Some good food sources of starch are cereals breads potatoes grains peas and beans Starch is also used for thickening sauces in cooking It is a white powder that is tasteless and odourless It can also be used for thickening cold foods when they are pre cooked

There are also different kinds of starch like laundry starch which gives clothing a smooth and crisp feel Sweat and dirt from a persons wrist and neck will stick to the starch on the clothes not to the fibers of the clothes and will wash away along with the starch Then after each laundry load the starch can be used again

Starch glues are used in wood cotton and bonding of paper Animals and humans have amylase so they can digest starch Starch was used in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries to stiffen the collars and ruffs of the fine linen which surrounded the neck Starch also requires heat to thicken The actual temperature depends on the type of starch

Hobbes mainly wrote about government and law  he was a political philosopher He tried to show that the best kind of government has one leader with total power But the most interesting thing about Hobbes was the way he argued He started by looking at human nature He said that humans are very selfish and that we are willing to hurt each other if we think it will help us He also said that naturally humans are all equal because we are all strong enough to kill each othereven a child can kill a strong man while he sleeps Then he imagined what things would be like without a government He said that it would be terriblea state of war There would not be enough stuff for everyone and people would disagree about who got what Some people would fight each other and everyone else would be very worried about their own safety No one would be able to trust anyone else or make plans for the future Life would be solitary poor nasty brutish and short 

Next Hobbes argues that it would be a good idea for everyone to stop fighting and choose a leader Everyone should agree to obey the leader and give him all their power Then the leader is supposed to make laws to keep things safe Once the leader is in place everyone has to obey him even those who disagree with him This is because everyone already agreed to obey him no matter what This plan of giving so much power to the leader is risky but Hobbes says that its still a good idea He says its better to be mostly safe under an all powerful leader than to be in a state of war

Hobbes wanted his argument to be like math with each step leading to the next But many people disagreed with his argument Some said that Hobbes was in favor of rebellion because he said that people were naturally equal Others said that humans are not as selfish as Hobbes thought Today most people do not like the idea of an all powerful government But Hobbess argument was a very important one and philosophers who are interested in government still study Hobbess books very carefully

Trevi an old town and comune of Italy in the province of Perugia in east central Umbria 4253N 1245E at 424 meters above sea level on the lower part of Mt Serano above the wide plain of the Clitunno river It is 10 km SSE of Foligno and 20 km N of Spoleto The 2003 count of people by the government said that there were 7800 people living in the comune about half of the people live in the town and the other people live in the country near town The frazioni of Trevi are Borgo Bovara Cannaiola Coste Pigge Manciano Matigge Parrano Picciche S Lorenzo S Maria in Valle

Most of the town is densely built with many buildings predating the 18th century It crowns a summit and when one is in the centre the streets are mostly gently sloping From the town one can see one of the best views in Umbria over 50 km to the west and on clear days as far as Perugia to the north and even Monte Amiata in southern Tuscany On the main train route from Rome to Ancona there is a station at the botton of Monte Serano servicing Trevi but the rapid Intercity services do not stop The train service from Florence to Rome by way of Perugia also stops there Local bus connections are not frequent Trevi is a pleasant place to visit and of recent accommodation and good eating has become available there are few restaurants but they are good and more numerous than in other nearby small towns 

In Roman times Pliny the Elder said Trevi was a city of the old Umbrians and an old stone with Umbrian writing was found in the comune at Bovara in the 1950s Treviae is also listed in the 5thcentury Bordeaux Itinerary We do not know the history of Trevi in very old times although some walls in the center part of the town on the hill are as old as the 1st century BC Trevi started to spread out away from the hill during the time of the Empire when Hadrian fixed the main road in the area the Via Flaminia this made a small town in the plain grow at a place now called Pietrarossa For hundreds of years people have been finding old things there there were Roman baths that people were probably using in the time of St Francis who came here and told people to bathe in them

In old times people say that Trevi ruled the valley below it all the way to the Colli Martani the line of mountains that run down the middle of Umbria Trevi had a bishop until the 11th century and was an important place belonging to the Lombards At the beginning of the 13th century Trevi made itself independent and became a free commune It often fought on the side of Perugia to defend itself against nearby Spoleto and fought wars with other communes in the area winning some and losing some It was invaded by Spoleto in the 14th century and by the Trinci rulers of Foligno In 1438 Trevi became part of the lands belonging to the Church as part of the legation of Perugia after that Trevis history was as part of the States of the Church then of the united Kingdom of Italy

Trevi was at its most prosperous in the 15th century the town was so important for those who wanted to buy and sell that people called it il porto secco the dry port In 1470 with Foligno Trevi became the fourth town in Italy to have a printing press managed by the first known printing company Many big renaissance palazzi of the town indicate the contemporaneous prosperity

Trevi is inside two walls of the Middle Ages at the end of the 20th century people found that the inside walls were Roman

Trevi has about twenty old churches some of which are interesting

The country area around the town has many Romanesque churches some of those on the plain were built on the Roman Via Flaminia and indicate the roads former route Some of the stone in these churches is old Roman and derives from buildings long gone

Trevis big museum is the Museo S Francesco next to the Gothic church S Francesco which is not used for worship any more It has a few Roman stones but mostly many Umbrian paintings from the late Middle Ages to the 17th century the best painting once was part of an altar and it is by Lo Spagna There is a very interesting group of exvotos painted by ordinary people not famous artists of the 16th century to the 18thcentury

The Museo della Civilt dell Olivo demonstrates the local olive culture how they are planted how they grow and how they are made into oil The Flash Art Museum is dedicated to contemporary art and is the seat of an international art magazine

The oldest big book on the history of Trevi is Historia universale dello Stato temporale ed ecclesiastico di Trevi 1233 pages by Durastante Natalucci Trevi 1745 It was translated into a more modern and readable Italian by Carlo Zenobi a local historian between 1987 and 1994 An important book for the plain below Trevi is Cannaiola Memorie storiche raccolte negli anni 187374 by Father Pietro Bonilli

Pro Trevi the towns volunteer tourism office has helped people write and print new books about the history plants and animals of Trevi and the country nearby

Nicomachos or Nicomachus is a Greek name It can mean

A logo is a picture or drawing that is used by a person group or company to mark who they are 

A company or group can use a logo on the things that they make like on the things they sell on letters and in advertisements When a person sees the logo picture that person knows that the thing they see the logo on came from that company

Logos can have letters and words in them Many logos have the name of the company or group in them

Most logos are very simple drawings with only a small number of colors Some logos are only black and white

In many countries companies and groups should tell their countrys government about the logo they are using If they do this the government can help stop a different company or group from using the same logo so that every one can be sure that the logo is only used by the people who used it first This is sometimes called a trade mark

Logos are not used only by companies Many schools have logos Some cities have logos Clubs can have logos Even people can have their own logos if they want the heraldic badge is probably the oldest form of logo in the world

A picture also called an image is a group of colored points on a flat surface that looks the same as something else For example a picture can look the same as an object or a person Pictures can also be drawings paintings or photographs People who make such pictures are called artists photographers or painters Pictures are very helpful Sometimes people say pictures are worth a thousand words

An image is something that can be seen but it is not physically there It can be a photograph a painting or a picture on a television or computer screen A lens can make an image of an object appear somewhere else Cameras use this to make the image that becomes a photograph

Most pictures today are really photographs Photographs are made with cameras A camera makes a picture that looks very real

When there were no cameras people had to make their own pictures by using paint brushes pencils crayons pens and other things that people can write or draw with

Pictures made with paint and brush are called paintings Before cameras some artists were able to make very real looking pictures with just paint Sometimes pictures made with pencil or pen are called sketches if they are made very fast and only look a little bit like the real thing

Usually pictures are put on paper Pictures made with paint are usually put on a strong rough fabric called canvas Sometimes pictures can be put on walls or other things even glass

In special or old places such as churches sometimes people can see pictures on windows made out of colored pieces of glass These are called stained glass

If people take a lot of pictures and show them one at a time very fast they can make a picture look like the picture are moving This is called a moving picture or a movie A television shows people a picture by using light shined on a glass screen A projector shines light from a light bulb through a kind of picture that the eyes can see through When light shines through this kind of picture onto a wall or another flat place the picture can be seen on that flat place

Some people can make pictures that do not look flat by taking two regular flat pictures at the same time People have to move their eyes in a special way so that they can see both pictures together When they look at the pictures the right way the picture does not look flat This is called 3D or three dimensional

Pictures and Diagrams can be used to explain how to use tools and thus a picture is itself a kind of tool

Building may be a noun or a verb Building is one of the most ancient human skills It is part of how we have survived and it is the clearest symbol of every civilization Although some other animals build simple structures eg birds ants and bees humans have learned to build in a great many different ways to suit different needs and local conditions We build mostly for shelter Buildings can shelter people or animals or machinery or anything The simplest building is just a roof to keep the space beneath dry or shady Adding walls gives more shelter from the wind or rain It also gives security 

By putting a window in a wall with or without glass we let light inside the building We leave a hole somewhere big enough to go in and out with a door which can be opened and closed Often the door will have a lock so the building can be left secure

If a building is to last for a long time it must have a foundation This is like the root of a tree which is sunk in the ground and supports the walls If the ground is soft the foundation must be very deep and strong

If a building is high enough it can have more than one floor People can climb from one floor to the next by a staircase or perhaps by a lift or elevator This is known as going upstairs or downstairs Buildings can also have a floor under the ground This is usually called a cellar or basement

So we build shelters places to live and to raise our young We also build places to work and to make things places to store things places to sell things places where sick people can go to be treated places to put people who break our laws We build to make life easier or to make money 

But we also design some buildings for a very different reason We build churches where a large number of people can gather to worship god or listen to what other people have to say Until we began to build skyscrapers churches were always the very largest tallest buildings of all except for castles The biggest churches of all cathedrals are even bigger than most castles

Big buildings have always symbolised power They are built to impress and to give a focus to our cities They are designed to make us feel small and to make those who own them appear big Banks and governments like to build tall impressive buildings for the same reason 

Buildings can be beautiful or ugly exciting or boring Architects are people trained to design buildings There have been many good architects and also many bad ones just as there have been good builders and bad Architecture can be an art form Look at the building where you are reading this Look at the shapes and shadows Is there enough light Do some rooms make you feel like staying in them while others make you want to hurry away Do they have interesting features Think about how you could have made the building better Almost anybody can become an architect if they want to badly enough but only a good architect or a good builder can make a beautiful building

A candle is a stick made of wax with a string straight in the middle If someone puts the string on fire the flame burns slowly but for a long time

Fire can burn most string very fast But in a candle the string does not burn fast because the fire melts the wax instead The wax sometimes drips down the side of the candle When the melted wax is far from the flame it gets hard again and can be used again in a new candle 

The flame is very hot since it is a very small real fire The light blue part of the flame can be as hot as convert1400CF It can still burn people and things If the fire spreads it can grow into a very big fire and even burn down a house or building 

If the flame is kept on the candle long enough the candle will slowly get shorter and shorter until it is gone The fire on a candle can be put out by blowing air on it There is also a special tool called a candle snuffer that covers the fire with a small metal cup and puts it out Today candle snuffers are usually only used in churches or in places where candles are up very high Stopping the fire stops the candle from burning until it is all gone

Before light bulbs candles were used so people could see at night Some people still use candles today when electricity is down or because they like the little amount of light that candles make Some people also like candles because they look nice or because they smell nice A special kind of candle called citronella can help keep bugs away

Candles are expensive and the amount of light that they give is small

Salamanders are amphibians They are the order Caudata There are about 500 different species 

Salamanders live in water and on land and look rather like lizards with four legs and a tail They hatch as larvae from eggs in the water At that stage they have gills that stick out 

Most salamanders live on land when they are adults after changing their shape On land salamanders are confined to moist habitats Their method of respiration varies Some salamanders stay in the water but look like adults These are called newts Some salamanders retain gills into sexual maturity such as the Axolotl This process is called neoteny 

Often salamanders may have a chemical defence to predators they are poisonous to eat In this case they will have warning colouration Otherwise if not poisonous they will usually have camouflage

Salamanders are the only tetrapods able to regeneate limbs as well as other body parts

Respiration differs between species of salamanders Species that lack lungs respire through gills In most cases these are external gills visible as tufts on either side of the head although the amphiumas have internal gills and gill slits Some salamanders that are terrestrial have lungs that are used in respiration although these are simple and sac like unlike the more complex organs found in mammals Many species such as the Olm have both lungs and gills as adults  

Some terrestrial species lack both lungs and gills and perform gas exchange through their skin a process known as valerian respiration in which the capillary beds are spread throughout the epidermis and inside the mouth Even some species with lungs can also respire through the skin in this manner

The skin of salamanders secretes mucus This helps to keep the animal moist when on dry land and maintains their salt balance while in water as well as providing a lubricant during swimming Salamanders also secrete poison from glands in their skin and some additionally have skin glands for secreting courtship pheromones

Hunting is yet another unique aspect of salamanders In the lungless salamanders muscles surrounding the hyoid bone contract to create pressure and actually shoot the hyoid bone out of the mouth along with the tongue The tip of the tongue is composed of a mucus which creates a sticky end to which the prey is captured Muscles in the pelvic region are used in order to reel the tongue and the hyoid back to its original position 

Many of the highly aquatic species however have no muscles in the tongue and do not use it for capturing prey while most other species have a mobile tongue but without the adaptations to the hyoid bone Most species of salamander have small teeth in both the upper and lower jaws Unlike frogs even the larvae of salamanders possess these teeth

To find their prey salamanders use trichromatic color vision in the ultraviolet range Permanently subterranean salamanders have reduced eyes which may even be covered by a layer of skin The larvae and the adults of some highly aquatic species also have a lateral line organ similar to that of fish which can detect changes in water pressure Salamanders have no external ear and only a vestigial middle ear

Salamanders can drop their tail to escape predators The tail will drop off and wriggle around for a little while and the salamanders will either run away or stay still enough to not be noticed while the predator is distracted Salamanders routinely regenerate complex tissues Within only a few weeks of losing a piece of limb a salamander perfectly reforms the missing structure

There are ten families in the order Urodela divided into three suborders

Newts are small amphibians a kind of salamander They are found in North America Europe and North Asia

Their mother lays eggs and leaves them Tadpoles are born from those eggs 

Newts have three life stages First as a tiny aquatic larva which gradually undergoes metamorphosis Then they leave the water for a year as a juvenile called an eft They go back in the water to breed as adults 

In some species the adults stay in water for the rest of their lives Others are land based but return to water each year to breed

Many newts produce toxins in their skin secretions as a defence against predators They have bright skin colours as a warning to other animals

Taricha newts of western North America are particularly toxic the Rough skinned newt Taricha granulosa of the Pacific Northwest produces more than enough tetrodotoxin to kill an adult human Recently a 29 year old man in Coos Bay Oregon who had been drinking heavily swallowed a rough skin newt for a dare he died later that day despite hospital treatment

Most newts can be safely handled provided that the toxins they produce are not ingested or allowed to come in contact with mucous membranes or breaks in the skin After handling proper hand washing techniques should be followed due to the risk from the toxins they produce and bacteria they carry such as salmonella It is illegal to handle or disturb Great Crested Newts in the UK without a licence

The term newt has traditionally been used as a functional term for salamanders living in water and not a systematic unit The relationship between the genera has been uncertain though they may be a natural systematic unit Newer molecular analysis tend to suggest they actually do form a clade Newts only appear in one subfamily of salamanders the Pleurodelinae However some of the genera sometimes listed as Pleurodelinae are not newts

In biology poisons are substances that can cause problems to organisms This is usually done by a chemical reaction The effect of the poison varies with the quantity that is absorbed by the organism A dose of poison can cause harmful effects or injuries and sometimes even death Stuff or substance which has the properties of a poison is poisonous or toxic If poisoning causes death it is lethal poison

Legally and in hazardous chemical labeling poisons are especially toxic substances Less toxic substances are labeled harmful irritant or not labeled at all 

In medicine and zoology toxins and venoms are different from poisons Toxins are the result of a biological process Certain organisms use venoms for hunting or as a defense If an organism is poisonous it is harmful to eat If it is venomous it has a harmful bite or sting For some very deadly bites humans have developed effective antivenoms

Very often it is only the quantity of a substance that makes the difference Drinking alcoholic drinks may lead lead to aggressive behaviour problems with speech and different forms of amnesia This effect is called intoxication People who drink even more often are in shock At the same time alcohol can be used as a disinfectant

Another example Drinking water may be deadly Drinking about ten litres of waters can lead to death for an adult Water is not poisonous it is the effect it has that is in this case People will die from a lack of sodium Drinking the water in smaller doses will give the body time to replace the sodium it loses 

Sometimes poisons have an antidote The antidote of a poison will slow or reverse its effects Note that the antidote may itself be a poison As an example Atropine can be used as an antidote against certain nerve gases like tabun or sarine or against certain insecticides It is also used as a drug In high doses Atropine is a poison Atropine is a core medicine in the World Health Organizations Essential Drugs List

There are other types of dangerous materials These are

Pollution also sometimes is poisonous For example large amounts of potato peeling scraps or milk can kill organisms in waterways because they contain so much nutrients for microbes that the microbes consume all oxygen from the waterway

In wars some countries use poison gases against their enemies Poison gases such as chlorine gas and mustard gas were used in World War I Corrosive poison gases cause serious burns to the skin eyes and lungs Nerve agents can kill by poisoning

Powder is very small dry pieces or grains When we press some dry solids very hard or when we cut something up into lots of small pieces we can sometimes make powder 

For example people sometimes put face powder on their faces when they want to look good Sometimes sports players put powder on their hands to make them dry We put curry powder in our food to make it taste stronger We put washing powder in the washing machine when we want to have clean clothes People use gunpowder to make bombs and fireworks

To powder is also a verb Mary powdered her face When a person says I am going to powder my nose they usually mean that they are going to use the toilet

Many animals develop in separate stages A larva develops from the egg in those animals It is a separate life stage from the adult reproductive stage A larva does not look like the adult animal and changes shape as it grows up There may be several larval stages before the adult form Tadpoles maggots and caterpillars are larvae

Marine organisms with a larval stage often release large numbers of eggs and sperms into the water column After fertilisation the eggs develop into tiny larvae The larvae develop and grow for some time before metamorphosing into adults Most marine invertebrates and many fish have a pelagic larval stage or pelagic eggs These live in the plankton and may be transported long distances

Probably the most widely accepted theory explaining the evolution of larval stages is the need for dispersal Sessile organisms such as barnacles and tunicates and sea floor groups like mussels and crabs need some way to move their young into new territory since they cannot move long distances as adults Many species have relatively long pelagic larval stages During this time larvae feed and grow and many species move through several stages of development For example most barnacles moult through six nauplius larva stages before moulting to a cipris when they look to settle The larvae eat different food from the adults and disperse

The other consideration is the small size of the eggs If animals lay many small eggs then the young stages cannot live the life the adults lead They must live a separate life until they have the size and capability to live as an adult This is what the larvae do

A long standing theory is that in transformed larvae of sea squirts lies the origin of vertebrates Tunicates are sessile but their larvae are mobile and have some features found in early vertebrates The process of paedomorphosis where juvenile features are retained in the adult is the proposed mechanism Genome analysis does show that the tunicates are the closest living relatives of vertebrates

Amphibians are a group of four legged animals They form the class Amphibia They live in shallow water and on land and must lay their eggs in water They have a larval stage in water and the adult stage usually lives mostly on land 

Early amphibia from the Carboniferous were quite large predators with flat skulls The amphibia which survive today are much smaller and more specialised forms Frogs and toads newts and salamanders and caecilians are all amphibians 

As amphibia grow from a larva to an adult they change shape This is metamorphosis They lose their gills and tails and grow front and hind legs Larval frogs toads or salamanders are called tadpoles They then grow appendages to become the amphibian they are today

Adult females lay as many as 4000 eggs usually in the water or in wet places They eat other animals especially insects Amphibians are cold blooded which means that their body temperature does not adapt to the weather

In terms of species numbers amphibians are still quite successful They are just limited in the habitats they can live in There are about 5700 living species of amphibia For comparison there are about 4000 mammalian species

A father is a male parent of someone Most animals including human beings are born from a mother and a father The father of a persons husband or wife is their father in law

In some cultures father means a leader The founders of a country are sometimes referred as Fathers Creators or inventors are sometimes called fathers

In some religions such as the Jewish religion or Christianity the God is called Father In the Christian belief God is three Persons Father Son and the Holy Spirit Father can also be used as a title for Catholic priests The daddy is the father 

If a man and a woman get married then in many Western countries the woman and their children will use the mans last name For example if the woman is called Sasha Dooley and the man is called Ben Allen from birth and they get married then she will become Sasha Allen and the man will still be Ben Allen They might have children named John Allen and Mary Allen

Gills are what fish amphibians and some other animals use to breathe in water They have feathery parts that water moves across in the animals body which contains dissolved oxygen after the animal has swallowed the water The oxygen is absorbed into the animals blood When this happens carbon dioxide moves out of the animals blood and into the water through the gills

Fish and frog gills are hidden on the sides of their heads Sharks have many gills slits on their necks Baby salamanders have gills that stick out like leaves from their heads

A frog is an amphibious animal They belong to the order Anura

Frogs can live on land and in fresh water Frogs cannot survive in salt water They hatch as tadpoles from eggs which are laid by a female frog The eggs are called frogspawn Tadpoles have tails and gills When they grow up they lose their tails and gills and grow four long legs Grown frogs can jump far with their legs They have long tongues that they use to catch bugs They make a sound called a croak They sometimes live in tree and some types of frog are capable of making poison Frogs live all over the world apart from Australia Different types of frogs are native to different countries and have different characteristics that relate to the environment of this country If an overseas species of frogs is introduced to another country the ecosystem can be hugely affected 

A chemical compound is a chemical made by joining together atoms of different chemical elements The different atoms are joined by chemical bonds The elements stick together so strongly that the compound behaves like one substance What chemical is made depends on what atoms it is made of and how they are joined together 

Chemical compounds can be liquids like water which is made from atoms of hydrogen and oxygen joining together They can also be solids like sodium chloride that contains sodium and chlorine atoms We get compounds from natural sources such as plants or make them in laboratories Compounds can be made from others by scientists and these are called synthetic chemicals

When different compounds are mixed together they can have a chemical reaction The compounds may join together to make one compound or change into several new compounds

Chemists are people study compounds and find new ways to do chemcial reactions They make chemicals in order to find new ways to do things like to make a better glue or to make new medicines or to make things clean for example They also use compounds to find out more about the laws of chemistry 

Sometimes people use the word chemical just to talk about compounds that are dangerous Many chemical compounds can be dangerous but are safe if they are used the right way We all use chemicals every day and these chemicals have to be tested to make sure they are safe Most dangerous chemicals are only used by scientists who have had special training in how to handle and use them These chemicals might be poisonous corrosive explosive they may catch fire easily or they may react with other substances

Some people who work in factories are near chemicals when they work and some of them can be dangerous Those people should do special things to make sure they are safe and sometimes they have to wear special clothes that stop the chemicals from hurting their body

Wood is the main substance in trees Wood is used for construction of buildings or furniture and also for art It is also used for making fires and heating Paper is made from wood by a chemical reaction

Wood is very simple to cut but it is also very strong A lumberjack is a person who cuts down trees After a tree falls the wood in it can be cut into long straight pieces called lumber Lumber can then be used to make posts or put together with nails screws or even glue to make wooden frames for other shapes 

Wood comes in many different kinds Oak and maple are widely used types of wood

For a long time and even today many buildings mostly houses have been made of wood To build a house with wood lumber is put together into frames that are the shape of each wall floor and roof of the house Then the frames are placed into the shape of a house Then the frames can be covered to make solid walls Sometimes the walls are made of more wood 

When the outside of a house or building is covered in wood the wooden pieces are usually flat and stacked These pieces are called shingles Wood is also sometimes used in other parts of the house like doors and staircases Wood is also used to make fences

People also make many kinds of furniture with wood like chairs dressers tables and desks

When someone builds something with wood they usually paint it Paint protects and beautifies the wood Some people like the look of wood so they put clear paint called varnish on it 

Some people make art with wood Sometimes sculptures are built with wood 

Regular pencils are made of wood with dark graphite inside for writing

A place that has many trees in it that are close together like a forest is sometimes called the woods when it is not very big

Wood can be turned into paper in large factories called paper mills The wood is first chopped into small chips and cooked with chemicals in large vessels The chemicals separate a substance called cellulose off the wood The cellulose is then added with other chemicals and additives and pressed into paper in large machines called paper machines Most paper is made from pine spruce and eucalyptus

Chalk is a type of limestone Air and water do not wear chalk away easily so when chalk is next to the sea it often makes a large cliff The White Cliffs of Dover in Kent England are a good example of this When chalk is near the top of the ground it often makes chalk hills Chalk holds water so these chalk hills have a lot of water in them and when the weather is very dry water comes slowly from the chalk Chalk is mostly formed from the calcareous skeletons of countless tiny planktonic algae called coccoliths It was laid down in the Upper Cretaceous period Chalk can write on a chalk Board

Blackboard chalk is not real chalk It is really gypsum but often people call it chalk People use it for drawing on hard things because it is soft If this chalk is rubbed on something hard or rough it will leave a mark People often write with chalk on a chalkboard or blackboard A chalk eraser or water can be used to clean the chalk marks away so the board is blank again Shops usually sell blackboard chalk in sticks that are about 5 cm long

There are also big pieces of soft chalk for children to write on the ground with for example on concrete or on asphalt It is usually okay to write on the ground with this kind of chalk because the rain will wash the chalk away

Tailors chalk is not real chalk either It is really talc Tailors use it to draw on material when they are making clothes

People in the military say a chalk is when an aeroplane is carrying a special load especially a group of soldiers in a single aeroplane US Army Ranger Chalk Four was a group that was hurt in the Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia

Utilitarianism is a theory in philosophy about right and wrong actions It says that the morally best action is the one that makes the most overall happiness or utility

The theory was made popular by 18th and 19th century British philosophers like Francis Hutcheson Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill but the idea goes all the way back to ancient times

Bentham wrote about this idea with the words The greatest good for the greatest number but did not use the word utilitarianism It was Mill a follower of Benthams ideas who named the idea 

A village is a place where people live normally in the countryside It is usually larger than a hamlet and smaller than a town or city In the past villages were where most people lived After the Industrial Revolution when people started making a lot of things in factories people lived more in towns Moving to towns is called urbanization

There have been many sorts of villages and ways of village life But usually villages were small with only 5 to 30 families Homes were together so people were with friends and felt safe They grew food on the land by the village

In England the biggest difference between a hamlet and a village is that villages have a church The difference between a village and a town is that the town has a marketCndateJanuary 2012

There are a lot of villages which people say are the biggest village in England Some are Bulkington in Warwickshire Cranleigh in Surrey Cottingham in the East Riding of Yorkshire both Haddenham and Wendover in Buckinghamshire Braunton in Devon Birchington in Kent Horsforth in West Yorkshire Street in Somerset Bembridge on the Isle of Wight Ruskington in Lincolnshire and Kidlington in Oxfordshire

In twenty US states a village is a sort of local government similar to a city but with less power and for a smaller place But this is not so in all the United States In many states there are villages which are bigger than the smallest cities in the state The difference is not the population it is how much power the different sorts of places have and what they do for people living there

In New York state a village is a place which is usually in a town There are villages that are part of more than one town Some villages are in two counties

In many states a village is only a place where people live with no legal power similar to a hamlet in New York state The name for these is unincorporated villages

Chelmsford is a town in the county of Essex England It is 30 miles northeast of London about halfway to Colchester It is nearly in the centre of the county and it is the county town of Essex but it is not the biggest or the oldest town in the county It is also the centre of the borough of Chelmsford which is a bigger place than the town

Chelmsford has the smallest cathedral in England John Dee who wrote the English version of Euclid went to the Cathedral school in the sixteenth century Chelmsford is also home to some of the Anglia Ruskin University campuses

The number of people in and around the town is 156000 about one third of that number live in the town 

About 10000 people from Chelmsford travel to London every day This makes Chelmsford the busiest ordinary railway station in England

The A12 road from London which the Romans first built between London and Colchester went through the town but now goes around the east so the number of cars in the town is smaller

Chelmsford has been an important centre for industry since the 19th century It became home to the UKs first electrical engineering works and its first ball bearing factory

In 1898 Guglielmo Marconi the father of radio opened the Worlds first radio factory in Hall Street with about 50 workers In 1920 the factory was also the home of the first official sound broadcasts in the UK In 1922 the worlds first regular radio broadcasts started at the Marconi Research Centre at Writtle near Chelmsford

Places of interest in and near Chelmsford are for example Writtle where Robert I of Scotland was perhaps born and Pleshey where the ruins of a castle in William Shakespeares play Richard II are

Hylands House and Park west of the town is an old country house People can visit it and in the last years it has been the place for a popular yearly music festival 

The old Palace of Beaulieu is also nearby

In 1199 the Bishop of London gave a Royal Charter for the town to have a market But there have been people living here since pre historic times The Romans also lived in Chelmsford An octagonal temple is under the Odeon roundabout

In World War II bombs hit Chelmsford a number of times The worst single loss of life happened on Tuesday December 19 1944 The 367th V 2 rocket which hit England fell near the Hoffmans ball bearing factory 39 people were killed and 138 hurt 47 of them badly A lot of buildings were destroyed and hundreds more were damaged

From over 600000 years ago the early River Thames went through the place where Chelmsford is now from Harlow to Colchester Then it went over todays North Sea and went into the Rhine 

Chelmsford is twinned with these

Gangnihessou was the first of twelve kings of Dahomey in Africa Gangnihessou might have been the king around the year 1620 One of his symbols was a bird called gangnihessou after his name His other symbols were a drum and sticks used for throwing or hunting He had a younger brother called Dakodonou who was a king Some historians thing instead of being a king himself Gangnihessou might have led people by giving advice to his brother

Tomorrow is the day that comes after today

In daily speech tomorrow does not mean only a single day but days in future Sometimes it is a symbol and synonym of the future

Contract bridge or simply bridge is a trick taking game that is played with four players It is played with 52 cards

The main competition is the Bermuda Bowl that Italy and North America won many times

No is a negative term It means someone is denying or turning away something

In both sentences and talking the words No and the word Not can both be used though the word No is mainly used when speaking to other people

Examples

Trotsky was a socialist and a Marxist In 1905 there was a revolution in Russia Trotsky helped organize a committee of workers in St Petersburg which was called the Soviet When the leader of the Soviet was arrested Trotsky became leader of the Soviet in his place Trotsky helped to expand on the idea of Permanent Revolution which is a theory originally thought up by Karl Marx

After the revolution Trotsky left Russia for his own safety In 1917 he returned to Russia because of the Russian Revolution He helped to bring about communism in Russia and defend it during the Russian Civil War He was in charge of the army at this time When the leader of the Bolsheviks Vladimir Lenin died Trotsky became involved in a power struggle with Joseph Stalin for the leadership of the party He lost and Stalin came to power He had to leave Russia because of Stalin who was now his own enemy and wanted to harm Trotsky Stalin had a Soviet spy murder Trotsky in Mexico in 1940

Devon is a county of England It is sometimes called Devonshire although this is not its correct name It is in the southwest of the country Devon is the second largest county in England and has the longest road network of any county in England

After the last ice age Devon was one of the first places in England where people started to live Archaeologists have found many old places in Devon with ancient buildings For example many ruins of old buildings have been found in an area called Dartmoor which is now a National Park

Devon gets its name from the Dumnonii a name that the invading Romans gave to the Celtic tribe in that area The Romans invaded Devon about AD 50 The name Dumnonii means a person who lives in a deep valley and it comes from the hills and valleys of the area The Roman army stayed in Devon for about 25 years Their base was in the city of Exeter

It was a long time before anyone else invaded Devon Saxons came to Devon in the 7th century and the King of Wessex may have attacked in 614 There was a conflict between Devon and Wessex for 200 years Some historians think that Wessex won the war by about 715 but others think this did not happen until at least 936 Eventually Wessex took control but the Kings of Devon still had some power

A person living at the time called William of Malmesbury said that in Exeter both Britons and Saxons were equal in 927 but that King Athelstan of Wessex then chased the Britons from Exeter From place names and church dedications it seems that the British did not go far and later came back into Exeter because an area in the city was called Britayne until recently

A large number of Devon placenames include the word combe This word comes from the Brythonic language and is like the Welsh word cwm Another typical Devon word is tor which is also Brythonic and like the Welsh word twr Both of these words are often found in neighbouring counties but Devon has the greatest number Overall Devon has a number of other placenames that are Brythonic and others that come from Old English and a few that come from Norse Devons placenames are like those of western Somerset and eastern Cornwall which was also part of the old kingdom of Dumnonia

Starting in the 9th century groups of Viking raiders tried to invade Devon This continued until the Norman Conquest The name of Lundy Island comes from the Viking language which was called Norse The Vikings are remembered for moving the cathedral from Crediton to Exeter

Devon is less wealthy than many parts of England for example the south east This is because the traditional industries of Devon for example fishing mining and farming are declining The European Union has given parts of Devon help For example grants of money have been given to help new industries grow Tourism has become more important recently as a part of the economy of Devon

An epidemic of Foot and Mouth disease in 2001 led to many farmers losing their cattle so they lost a lot of money Other industries also lost a lot of income because of this

Franz Ferdinand Karl Ludwig Josef of Austria Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria Este was an Archduke of Austria and from 1896 until his death heir presumptive to the Austro Hungarian emperor He was assassinated in Sarajevo A result of this was the Austrian declaration of war against Serbia which triggered World War I

Black Hand or Crna Ruka officially Ujedinjenje ili Smrt was a secret group of Serbian nationalists It was founded in 1911 in Serbia 

Their aim was to create a country from other countries where Serbs lived including Bosnia Herzegovina which was a part of Austria Hungary since 1908 

Five members of the The Black Hand were in Sarajevo Serbia on 28 June 1914 where Archduke Franz Ferdinand the heir to the throne in Austria Hungary visited with his wife Ferdinand was driven through the city in a convertible car The members of the Black Hand attempted to kill Ferdinand by throwing grenades at his car One of the grenades bounced off his car and exploded under the car following Ferdinands One of the members swallowed poison and attempted to jump into the river however the poison was old and the river was shallow so he was arrested One of the men a Bosnian student called Gavrilo Princip went to a cafe after failing to kill Ferdinand 

The Archduke and his wife decided to go and visit the people who were injured in the explosion in hospital however the driver took a wrong turn and stopped outside the cafe where Princip was eating Princip saw this and went outside He took out a gun and shot at Ferdinand two bullets hit the archduke one hit his wife and the other hit the car Both Ferdinand and his wife died shortly after

Austria Hungary blamed Serbia for the assassination Austria Hungary then declared war on Serbia and Russia joined the war on Serbias side because the people of Serbia were Slavic like Russia and the Slavic countries had agreed to help each other if they were attacked Since Russia is a large country it had to move soldiers closer to the war but Germany feared that Russias soldiers would also attack Germany Russia did not like Germany because of things Germany had done in the past to become stronger Germany declared war on Russia and used a plan to attack Russia that had been created before the war but it also involved attacking France and Belgium France and Great Britain joined the war because Great Britain had agreed to help Belgium if it were ever attacked by someone else

This quickly led to a full scale war Austria Hungary declared war on Serbia Both countrys allies became involved in the war and soon most of Europe became involved

The Black Hand also killed King Aleksandar Obrenovic and Queen Draga Masin

Bonsai is the art of growing small trees in pots This is done by growing the tree in a small pot or tray and pruning the branches and roots to keep the tree small over time Bonsai trees are trained to grow into a shape that is pleasing to look at The best bonsai trees appear to be old and to have a shape that seems like a real tree except much smaller

The word bonsai means tree in tray in the Japanese language Bonsai is a very old art form in Japan It is a Japanese form of the older Chinese art called penjing Penjing is a Chinese art form that also uses trees growing in pots Other nations also have arts like bonsai and penjing

People like bonsai because it is nice to look at and because it is fun to grow a bonsai tree A bonsai tree can live for a very long time longer than a person can live In a family a bonsai might be started by a grandparent then given to a parent then given to a child over many years

A bonsai starts with a small tree This tree can be grown from a seed or can be found already growing in a yard or a park or the forest It can also be bought from a plant store

To make the bonsai the small tree is taken out of the ground Its roots are carefully cleaned of dirt The roots may be trimmed a little to help them fit in a small pot The branches may also be trimmed to make the tree smaller Then it is put in a bonsai pot which has low sides Fresh soil is put in the pot to cover the bonsai trees roots Then it is watered and put outdoors to live

Good trees to make into bonsai have small leaves If the leaves are too big the bonsai will not look like a small tree A good bonsai tree will have old looking bark and old looking roots too

The art of bonsai began in Japan over one thousand years ago It was brought to Japan from China around the year 800 AD At first bonsai were planted in large pots like the Chinese used But the Japanese later put them in very low almost flat pots This change made the tree itself the most important thing in the art form not the fancy pot or small houses or statues of people which other nations used with their small trees in pots 

At first only the rich and noble people of Japan had bonsai One family could have many bonsai which would grow in pots in the garden outside of the house A servant might take care of all the bonsai and would learn a lot about how to grow bonsai The rules about how to grow a bonsai properly were not well known and were not shared with other people Later more people began to grow bonsai Some were holy people like monks Some were Japanese families who were not noble or really rich but who had enough money and time to grow one or two bonsai in their gardens or house yards This larger group of people began to share what they learned about the rules of bonsai and so more people could join in growing bonsai By the twentieth century the rules of bonsai were very well known in Japan and many people could afford to grow their own bonsai

A tree that could be used for bonsai is not small in nature If left to grow in the open soil a bonsai tree would grow as big as any other tree But in a pot the tree will not grow very big To help keep it small the owner of the bonsai trims its leaves and branches every year Every two or three years the bonsai owner lifts the bonsai out of its pot and trims the roots Then the owner puts the bonsai back in its pot with some new soil

A bonsai grower checks the soil of every bonsai pot once every day If the soil is nearly dry the grower waters it until it is wet from the top of the soil to the bottom of the pot Every few weeks the grower adds a little fertilizer to each bonsai trees soil In the winter this happens less often 

A bonsai can live to be older than a large tree of the same species if it is grown with care A bonsai needs good care and a bonsai with poor care will not be healthy and might die To keep a bonsai strong it must grow outdoors like a real tree It must never get too dry or stay too wet It must never get too hot or too cold If it gets a plant sickness like a fungus it must be cured quickly If it gets bugs like aphids the bugs must be cleaned off or killed quickly

In the art of bonsai a sense of beauty patience and good care are all needed The plant the shape of the plant as well as the arrangement of soil and the kind of pot used are important

For the Japanese each bonsai has a shape partly the shape and direction of the trunk and partly the shape of the whole tree with its branches and leaves The most common shapes are known as styles Here are the most common shapes

Psychology is the study of the mind and of thought feeling and behavior It deals mainly with humans but also sometimes with animals Because psychology is difficult to study as a whole psychologists often only look at small parts of it at a time Psychology has much in common with many other fields and overlaps with many of them Some of these fields are medicine biology computer science and linguistics

Psychology has been split up into smaller parts called branches These are subjects in psychology that try to answer a particular group of questions about how people think Some branches of psychology that are often studied are

Psychology is often treated as a type of science and a lot of psychologists use many of the same types of methods that researchers from other natural and social sciences use 

Psychologists will make theories to try to explain a behavior or pattern they see Based on their theory they will make some predictions They may then carry out an experiment or collect other types of information that will tell them whether their predictions were right or wrong 

Some types of experiments cannot be done on people because the process would be too long expensive dangerous unfair or otherwise unethical There are also other ways psychologists study the mind and behavior scientifically and test their theories Psychologists might wait for some events to happen on their own they might look at patterns among existing groups of people in natural environments or they might do experiments on animals

Psychology shares other things with natural sciences as well For example a good psychological theory may be possible to prove wrong Just like in any natural science a group of psychologists can never be completely sure that their theory is the right one but if a theory can be proven wrong and yet other psychologists do not successfully prove it wrong then it is more likely that the theory is accurate This is called falsifiability

Scientific psychologists use many different tools as part of their daily work and to carry out their studies Psychologists use surveys to ask people how they feel and what they think They may use special devices to look at the brain and to see what its doing Psychologists also often use computers so that they can carefully measure when and how people behave usually in response to pictures words symbols or other stimuli Psychologists also use statistics to help them analyze the data that they get from their experiments

Not all psychology is scientific psychology Psychodynamic psychology and depth psychology do things like interpreting peoples dreams to understand the unconscious mind as in older approaches to psychology begun by Sigmund Freud or Carl Jung

Humanistic psychology and existential psychology also believe that it is more important to understand personal meaning than to find causes and effects of mental processes and behaviors

Psychologists are people who work in the field of psychology A psychologist may work in either basic research or applied research or if he or she is a clinical psychologist or counseling psychologist they may be a therapist Basic research is the study of people or animals to learn more about them Applied research is using what was learned from basic research to solve real world problems

To become a psychologist a person must first get a basic degree at a university and then go to graduate school A Masters degree either MS or MA allows beginning work like a school psychologist A Doctorate degree takes a longer time because it includes studying more material and writing a research paper called a dissertation The doctoral graduate uses the initials PhD or DPhil after his or her name Some clinical psychologists earn a Doctor of Psychology degree and use the initials PsyD after their name The American Psychological Association says that a person needs a PhD or PsyD to call himself or herself a psychologist

The words psychologist and psychiatrist may be confused with each other A psychiatrist has graduated from medical school and uses the initials MD Usually a psychologist cannot prescribe drugs for a patient only a psychiatrist or another MD can do this

For the Lady Gaga song see Telephone

A telephone is an electric tool Using a telephone two people who are in different places can talk to each other Early telephones needed to be connected with wires Now telephone calls can be sent with radio This is also called wireless 

Most people believe that the telephone was invented in 1876 by Alexander Graham Bell He was a 29 year old Scotsman living in the USA But Antonio Meucci developed and patented a working telephone in the USA in 1871 This was five years earlier than Bell Meucci was unable to find someone to provide him with the money to finance his project His wife was sick and had to stay in bed Meucci invented his teletrofono to talk to her while he worked in his workshop

The name Vie means vine in Romanian It is the part of the city where the richest and most important people live Vie is on the hills overlooking Oradea Vie is popular with the elite for two main reasons it is close to Oradea within walking distance of the railway station and the city centre and it is peaceful and has fresh air Vie has many mansions In the north of Vie at the top of the hills there are also farms that grow grapes for making wine

Vie also has the County Hospital of Oradea the tuberculosis hospital and the mental hospital In communist times blocks of flats were built at the bottom of the hills

The border between Vie and the city centre of Oradea is the railway station and railway tracks Everything above the main railway station of Oradea is considered to be part of Vie Despite its nearness to the railway station and Oradea Vie is not easy to reach by public transport because many of its roads are unpaved and very steep Some parts of the quarter are within walking distance of the railway station and the main supermarkets and shops of Oradea but others are more only easy to get to by car There is a bus service that serves the three hospitals in the region and the houses among them

Like Rogerius Nufrul is like a mini city with supermarkets large blocks of flats and more It is on the eastern outskirts of Oradea and is near to Bile Felix the famous spa resort It is possible to get to Nufrul by tram and bus It is perhaps the fastest growing area because of its position many highways and national roads lead from Oradea to other Romanian cities and pass through Nufatilderul For example Nufrul was home to the second McDonalds in Oradea as well to many supermarkets that were not in central Oradea Even though Nufrul has a lively market and excellent transport education and shopping it is not as nice as central Oradea because it was planned and rebuilt in communist times

The name Nufrul means water lily in Romanian It has this name because there are many water lilies in the area

Rogerius is located at the western end of the city near Bor on the Hungarian border It is the citys largest district other than the city centre and is home to many communist era housing estates as well as a large market You can get to Rogerius by tram from the city centre and other parts of Oradea as well as by bus It is also the first part of Oradea visitors will see when coming from Western Europe or Hungary through via Bor The western part of Rogerius has factories from Communist times including a chemical factory called Sinteza

Unlike many of the other outer quarters of Oradea Iosia does not have many large apartment blocks and is still fairly rural It is located in the citys far southwest The quarter is one of the most beautiful in Oradea and has most of the facilities and amenities of the city For tourists it shows what Romanian country life is like while still being in the city close to all the excellent facilities that Oradea is home to

There is a public transport system run by Regia Autonom Oradea Transport Local There are three tram lines and some bus routes The city has three train stations central Vest and Est Vest Station is in the quarter of Ioia and the central station is in the city centre near the quarter of Vie

The city has many Baroque buildings It was part of the Austro Hungarian Empire many times in history

The city centre is beautiful and worth visiting as well as many other sites

There are around 100 churches in Oradea and three synagogues Only one of the synagogues is still being used Oradea also has the biggest Baptist church in Eastern Europe

Henry Ford was an American engineer and businessman He started making cars in 1896 and founded the Ford Motor Company He developed the idea of a system in which each worker has the duty to do one small part of the process of making something His idea made it possible to produce cars in large numbers This was called the assembly line This is still a very popular way of making many things in factories It was quite innovative at the time and it allowed him to produce many cars quickly and at a cheaper price than other car companies could He married Clara Bryant and had one child named Edsel Bryant Ford Ford left home for Detroit Michigan to start his mechanical career

In 1903 Ford helped start the Ford Motor Company He was the first vice president of the company The company sold its first car on July 23 1903 Ford became president of the company in 1906

In 1908 Fords company began making the Ford Model T car Ford said that he wanted to make a motor car for the great multitudeThis meant that he thought that most Americans should be able to afford to buy a car and not just a few rich people In order to reach this goal he chose to make the design as simple as possible All his cars would be made the same way In fact Ford would start making them all the same color  black It cost 850 to buy a Model T car Even though that was a lot of money back then it was still very cheap for a car Many people wanted to buy Model T cars In fact so many people wanted to buy them that Ford was having a hard time making enough cars to sell one to everybody who wanted to buy one

Ford helped come up with an idea called the assembly line and started using it in his factories in 1913 Because of the assembly line making new cars would not take as long He put a moving belt in his factory Cars moved along the belt and workers put on one part at a time Each worker would only be responsible for putting one part on cars

The assembly line was a big success Cars did not take as long to make and they were cheaper to buy now too By 1916 it only cost 360 to buy one of Fords cars and more than three times as many people were buying his cars now The Ford Model T changed America It made it easier for people to live in the city instead of the country

Ford was also known for his political views He had been against World War I because he thought that it was a waste of time He also believed that Jewish people were causing problems in the world This belief is called Anti Semitism In 1919 he took over a newspaper called the Dearborn Independent He began publishing articles that blamed Jews for problems in the world Later he would blame Jewish bankers for starting World War II

George Orwell was an English writer His real name was Eric Arthur Blair He used the name George Orwell for his novels

He was born in India during the British Empires rule of India He is best known for two novels that he wrote in the late 1940s Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty Four In those works he said that totalitarianism especially Stalinism was very bad

Orwell fought in the Spanish Civil War with the antifascist troops These troops were against the dictatorship of fascist governments

Orwell died of tuberculosis in London

Eric Arthur Blair was born on 25 June 1903 in India His great grandfather Charles Blair had been a rich gentleman who had married Lady Mary Fane and he was supported by money from slave plantations in Jamaica His grandfather Thomas Richard Arthur Blair was a clergyman His father Richard Walmesley Blair worked in the Indian Civil Service His mother Ida Mabel Blair grew up in Burma Eric had two sisters Marjorie his first sister was five years older than he was Avril was five years younger When Eric was one year old Ida took him to England

Eric grew up with his mother and sisters Except for a short visit he did not see his father again until 1912 The family moved to Shiplake before World War I There Eric became friends with the Buddicom family especially Jacintha Buddicom They read poetry and hoped to become famous writers At this time he also liked fishing and watching birds with Jacinthas brother and sister

When he was five Eric was sent to a convent school where Marjorie went to It was a Catholic convent His mother wanted him to go to public school but his family was not rich enough to pay for it Idas brother Charles Limouzin was asked to help find the best school to help Eric prepare for better things He suggested St Cyprians School in Eastbourne Sussex Limouzin who was a good golfer came to know the school and its headmaster at the Royal Eastbourne Golf Club The headmaster helped Blair win the scholarship to pay for his education He also let Blairs parents pay only half the usual amount of money However Blair hated the school

Genghis Khan was one of the world most powerful military leaders ever who joined with the Mongol tribes and started the Mongol Empire His children and his grandchildren etc passed down his throne and started the largest empire in the world 

Genghis Khans grandson Kublai Khan was the first ever emperor of the Yuan Dynasty in China No one knows where the burial site of Genghis Khan is He was a Mongol Emperor who was very successful in battle killing many enemies such as the Jin Dynasty He was a very strong and powerful Emperor who occupied much of China and the some surrounding countries of China 

Genghis Khan was not born with the name Genghis he was actually born with the name Temujin After being a very successful tribes leader and conquering a lot of land people referred to him as Genghis meaning Universe ruler Over the next few decades Genghis led a massive military campaign conquered vast areas killing many people giving him a reputation in the history books as a brutal monster 

Temjin was related on his fathers side to Khabul Khan Ambaghai and Qutula Khan who had headed the Mongol confederation When the Chinese Jin Dynasty switched support from the Mongols to the Tatars in 1161 they destroyed Khabul Khan Genghiss father Yesgei emerged as the head of the ruling clan of the Mongols but this position was contested by the rival Tayichiud clan who descended directly from Ambaghai When the Tatars grew too powerful after 1161 the Jin switched their support from the Tatars to the Keraits

Because of the lack of records there is very little information about the early life of Temjin The few sources that provide insight into this period often conflict

Temjin was born in 1162 in a Mongol tribe near Burkhan Khaldun mountain and the Onon and Kherlen Rivers in modern day Mongolia not far from the current capital Ulaanbaatar The Secret History of the Mongols reports that Temjin was born with a blood clot grasped in his fist a sign that he was destined to become a great leader He was the second oldest son of his father Yeskhei a minor tribal chief of the Kiyad and an ally of Ong Khan of the Kerait tribe and the oldest son of his mother Hoelun According to the Secret History Temjin was named after a Tatar chieftain whom his father had just captured The name also suggests that they may have been descended from a family of blacksmiths

Yeskheis clan was called Borjigin and Hoelun was from the Olkhunut the sub lineage of the Onggirat tribe Like other tribes they were nomads Because his father was a chieftain as were the ones before him Temjin was of a noble background

No accurate portraits of Genghis exist today and any surviving depictions are considered to be artistic interpretations Persian historian Rashid al Din recorded in his Chronicles that the legendary glittering ancestor of Genghis was tall long bearded red haired and green eyed Rashid al Din also described the first meeting of Genghis and Kublai Khan when Genghis was shocked to find that Kublai had not inherited his red hair Also according to al Din Genghiss Borjigid clan had a legend involving their origins it began as the result of an affair between Alan ko and a stranger to her land a glittering man who happened to have red hair and bluish green eyes Modern historian Paul Ratchnevsky has suggested in his Genghis biography that the glittering man may have been from the Kyrgyz people who historically displayed these same characteristics Controversies aside the closest depiction generally accepted by most historians is the portrait currently in the National Palace Museum in Taipei Taiwan After his death his 3rd son Ogodei has succeeded him He had 4 queens and Ogodei was born from his first wife 

Joseph Stalin was the adopted name of the Communist dictator Iosif Dzhugashvili He was the second political leader of the Soviet Union after Vladimir Lenin He was a totalitarian ruler and stayed in power by removing anyone he thought might be a threat to him His ideas and policies turned the Soviet Union into a powerful modern nation the largest state on earth but also led to the deaths of millions of people This form of communism was later called Stalinism

Ioseb Vissarionovich Jugashvili was born in a small one room house in Gori Georgia His father made and fixed shoes His father was often drunk and used to hit his wife and his son until his death in a fight in 1890 Joseph had smallpox when he was young This left his face scarred Later photographs were often changed to hide the scars His left arm was also shorter because of an accident He was educated at the Gori church school Stalin studied to be a priest at a seminary in Tbilisi He was an active student reading many books especially books that were not allowed by the seminary This included books by Karl Marx He joined a Marxist group in 1898 the Mesame Dasi or Group Three

He left school in 1899 and got a job at the Tbilisi Physical Institute He joined groups that were trying to start a revolution to remove the Tsar They wanted a different type of government The police raided his house in 1901 while hunting for people who opposed the government Stalin escaped but went into hiding so the police could not find him He organized anti government activities such as May Day marches and protests He became a Bolshevik He supported a violent revolution and did not support the Mensheviks The secret police caught him in April 1902 and exiled him without trial to Siberia He lived in the village of Novaya Uda

He soon escaped from Siberia This led to many later claims that he was a police spy The arrest of another Bolshevik Stephan Shaumyan a rival of Stalin increased these beliefs At the end of 1905 he went to a meeting in Finland and met Vladimir Ilich Lenin Lenin was not what Stalin had expected The government arrested and exiled Stalin several times in the next ten years This increased his power in the Bolshevik party and he was elected to the Central Committee of the party in 1912 He was promoted to a position at StPetersburg

Stalin was a member of the Bolshevik Party but did not do much in the Russian Revolution of 1917 He was writing and editing Pravda the party newspaper He had a number of organizational jobs in the Communist Party In 1922 he became General Secretary He was able to give jobs to people he liked in the Communist Party These supporters helped him become the leader after Vladimir Lenin died in 1924

Stalin tried to collectivize farms Collectivization meant taking the land from owners of all farms and joining it into large farms run by the government Communist officials then let farmers work the new farms and told them to turn the harvest over to the government They did not work well Because they were not paid much money and whatever they grew went to the state the workers did not try their best The best farming worked on very small bits of land given to the peasants to grow what they liked On these pieces of land farmers could keep what they grew In 1938 these parts of land were 4 of Soviet farmland However they gave 20 of its produce

Stalin cooperated with Hitler before the World War II and finally in 1939 they both made an agreement to conquer Poland and divide it between themselves This is how World War II broke out

But later on in 1941 Hitler turned against Stalin and attacked the Soviet Union trying to conquer it After this happened the USSR began working with the Allies to defeat Germany Ultimately Germany lost but USSR had more casualties than any other country during the war

When the World War II was over the Soviet army ended up occupying many countries in Europe such as Poland Czechoslovakia Hungary and part of Germany imposing communism on these countries

Stalin continued to rule over the Soviet Union until he died Stalin also militarized Russia by focusing the countrys time and energy towards weapons vehicles and the armed forces 

Stalin died of a stroke in the year 1953 He was followed by Lavrentiy Beria Nikita Khrushchev and Georgi Malenkov The three of them began a process called De Stalinization which meant taking apart the political system that Stalin made

Stalin is a very controverisal figure in history Many historians see him as a ruthless dictator while others praise him as the Father of the Soviet State He has been criticized for his role in the Holodomor A recent poll in Russia listed him as the third most popular person in Russian history In 2006 a poll stated that almost half the adults in Russia thought Joseph Stalin was a good person

San Marino is one of the smallest countries in the world It is found in southern Europe fully surrounded by Italy Fewer than 30000 people live there Its total area is 61km2

San Marino is the worlds oldest republic that still exists It was started in AD 301 by a skilled builder called as Saint Marinus Its written constitution was adopted on October 8 1600 The very small nation was recognized by Napoleons France in 1797 and by the other European nations at the 1815 Congress of Vienna

Even though it is an independent country it depends very much Italy Since the 19th century when Italy was unified San Marino has been fully surrounded by Italy

The biggest industry in San Marino is tourism Selling postage stamps is an important source of income too San Marino is not a member of the European Union but the euro is used in San Marino

People in San Marino speak the Italian language Most people in San Marino believe in Roman Catholicism

An orbit is the path that an object takes in space when it goes around a star a planet or a moon It can also be used as a verb For instance The earth orbits around the Sun The word revolves has the same meaning 

Many years ago people thought that the sun orbits in a circle around the earth Every morning the sun came up in the east and went down in the west It just seemed to make sense that it was going around the earth But now thanks to people like Copernicus and Galileo Galilei we know that the sun is the center of the solar system and the earth orbits around it Since a satellite is an object in space that revolves around another object the earth is a satellite of the sun just like the moon is a satellite of the earth The sun has lots of satellites orbiting around it like the planets and thousands of asteroids comets and meteoroids The earth just has one natural satellite but there are lots of broken wikt linkartificeartificial satellites orbiting the earth

When people first began to think about orbits they thought that all orbits had to be perfect circles and they thought that the circle was a perfect shape But when people began to study the motions of planets carefully they saw that the planets were not moving in perfect circles Some of the planets have orbits that are almost perfect circles and others have orbits that are longer and less like a perfect circle

An orbital period is the time that it takes for one object  that is satellite  to orbit around another object For instance the Earths orbital period is one year 36525 days

Johannes Kepler wrote mathematical laws of planetary motion which gave a good idea of the movements of the planets because he found that the orbits of the planets in our solar system are not really circles but are really ellipses Which is why planets orbits are described as elliptical The more elliptical an orbit is the more eccentric the orbit is

Isaac Newton used his own ideas about gravity to show why Keplers laws worked the way they did

Funeral is an official ceremony of burying someone who has died Most religions have their own style of funeral ceremony

A funeral ceremony can be held in the house of the dead a church a temple or a public place The family and friends of the dead come together remember the dead and comfort each other If it is a religious ceremony they say a prayer for the dead so that his or her soul may rest in peace There are lots of different traditions that different religions use Sometimes at funerals the family or friends of the dead person want to pray or say something nice about them At Christian funerals the priest or preacher may say From earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust Modern funerals have greatly changed over time Present day funeral or memorial services may often be more like a thanksgiving for the life of the dead person rather than just thinking about the sadness of death

At many present day funerals there is a video tribute played before after or during the funeral service Memorial folders or prayer cards are handed out at many funeral services and this too is a way to make a funeral service personal At funerals it is not uncommon to see a life reflection table Family members bring favorite pictures or memorabilia to display as another reminder of the deceased Headstones are bought so that everyone can see who has been buried in a specific grave They usually tell the name date of birth and the date of death 

The Georgian Uprising of Texel was an insurrection by Soviet Georgian soldiers on the island of Texel The uprising was against the Germans who had taken over the Dutch island during the Second World War The event is sometimes described as Europes last battlefield

The island was very important in the German Atlantic Wall the line of defences along the Atlantic coast It was strong and had many defences The Georgians were soldiers from the Soviet Republic of Georgia who had been captured on the Eastern front They were now fighting for the Germans so that they did not have to stay in camps for prisoners Their job was to help the German troops

On the night of 4 April5 April 1945 they thought that the Allies would land soon They took over the island and killed 400 German soldiers Some parts of the island stayed under German control and the Georgian soldiers could not capture them More Germans were able to come to the island to help defeat the Georgians After a few weeks of very tough fighting the Germans took control of the island again

Unfortunately the British and Canadians who were warned of the events on Texel by escapees who fled by boat to England did not believe them and did not take any action in order to stop the fighting 

On Texel this is called the Russian war Approximately 800 Germans 500 Georgians and 120 Tesselans were killed Lots of farms were burned Even after the Germans surrendered in the Netherlands and Denmark on 5 May 1945 and after the full German surrender on 8 May the fighting continued Canadian soldiers stopped the fighting on 20 May

The Georgian survivors did not have a happy ending They were sent back to the Soviet Union Stalin said that because the soldiers had been captured by the Germans they had not fought until they died so they were traitors Most of the two million Soviet prisoners who were sent back to the Soviet Union by the Allied forces after the end of the war were executed when they got there 

Neutrinos are a type of elementary particle that exist all across the universe Physicists study these particles but they are hard to find because they have a very small chance of interacting with regular matter We used to think that they have no mass but a few years ago physicists found that they have a very small mass much lighter than electrons By finding neutrinos we can learn about the structure and the history of the universe

Neutrinos are very difficult to detect They are very unlikely to collide with other particles as they travel through space or through matter Unlike negatively charged electrons neutrinos have no charge This means that they are unaffected by the electromagnetic force too

They are commonly generated in particle accelerators the sun nuclear reactions and other stars They are generated whenever there is a nuclear reaction in the form of Beta decay This process starts off with one neutron and ends with one electron one proton and one neutrino

The 3 types of neutrinos are named after the previous three leptons There is the electron neutrino the muon neutrino and the tau neutrino Each neutrino has an antiparticle called an antineutrino Therefore there is an electron antineutrino a muon antineutrino and tau antineutrino

The three types of neutrinos change into each other over time so an electron neutrino could turn into a tau neutrino and then back again This is called neutrino oscillation This was first suggested as there were only a third of the number of electron neutrinos coming from the sun as theories of the time said there should be

Most neutrinos passing through the Earth emanate from the Sun About 65 billion solar neutrinos per second pass through every square centimeter perpendicular to the direction of the Sun in the region of the Earth

In September 2011 neutrinos apparently moving faster than light were detected Since then the experiment has undergone extensive critique and efforts to replicate the results because confirming the results would change our understanding of the theory of relativity Following the results of the September 2011 observation of faster than light neutrino velocities the faster than light neutrino anomaly the value of the neutrino velocity is the subject of theoretical and experimental studies In September 2011 the OPERA collaboration released calculations showing velocities of 17 GeV and 28 GeV neutrinos exceeding the speed of light in their experiments In November 2011 OPERA repeated its experiment with changes so that the speed could be determined individually for each detected neutrino The results showed the same faster than light speed More analyses and studies are underway

A play is a piece of writing which we see at a theatre or on television or hear on the radio Plays often show conversations between people We usually watch a play instead of reading it

The people who we see in a play are actors in a theatre they stand on a stage so the people watching can see them better A director helps the actors to work better or tells them how he wants the play to be

Plays can be very interesting because we can understand them in many ways When the writer  the playwright  makes the play he can not say how the actors or director will use it Sometimes the playwright is also the director or an actor Molire for example was often an actor in his plays But the director can change the play in different ways the actors costume the music how people say things how they move or what they hold Modern directors can direct plays by Shakespeare and these old plays seem modern now too

There are a lot of sorts of play but there are six important sorts

Symbolic can also be called expressionistic Its all about how the writer or director presents ideas in a very different point of view

Phrasal verb is the name given to an English verb which is composed of two or three words One verb is combined with a preposition or an adverb Sometimes a phrasal verb can have a meaning that is very different to the meaning of at least one of those two or three words separately Some text books call these verbs multi word verbs Phrasal verbs are used more frequently in everyday speech than in formal official writing or speaking 

Here are some examples

Maria didnt know the word so she looked it up in the dictionary

Oh no weve run out of milk Ill have to buy some more

Farmers have to get up early in the morning

The rocket took off with a loud roar

Often these phrasal verbs have a one word equivalent in other languages In Spanish to get up can be translated as levantarse in French as se lever etc

Many students of English as a foreign language panic when they hear the term phrasal verbs but in fact phrasal verbs are just vocabulary to memorize and not some strange secret grammatical formula In fact many native speakers of English do not know the term phrasal verb at all even though they probably use them very often

There are four different types of phrasal verbs These are

Instead of separate or separable some text books use the word split or splittable

A useful piece of advice to confused students of English is this

If you do not know if a phrasal verb is separable or inseparable ALWAYS use a noun or noun phrase and do not try to separate the verb

A season is a part of the year In most parts of the world we say there are four seasons in a year spring summer autumn or fall and winter In some countries people say there are a different number of seasons for example some people in Australias Northern Territory use six seasons

In places which are tropical and subtropical people more often speak about the rainy season and the dry season This is because the rain changes more than the temperature

Summer is a warm season because the days are longer and the Sun is high in the sky giving direct light to the ground  Winter is a cold season because the days are shorter and the Sun is low in the sky giving indirect light to the ground Both the changes in the length of the day and the height of the Sun at noon are caused by the tilt of the Earths spin axis with respect to the plane of the Earths path around the Sun At any time in any season the northern and southern hemispheres have opposite seasons

The date at which each season begins is different in different countries In the United States people say the seasons begin at the solstices and equinoxes The summer solstice is the longest day of the year and the winter solstice is the shortest The equinox is the time when the day and the night are the same number of hours assuming the sun were a point of light at its center Since civil dawn occurs when the edge of the sun first appears over the horizon and civil dusk occurs when the edge drops over the horizon the civil length of day is 12 hours long several days prior to the equinoxes In the USA summer begins at summer solstice winter at winter solstice spring at the spring equinox and autumn at the autumnal equinox

In Britain people traditionally say that the seasons begin about seven weeks earlier spring begins on Candlemas summer on May Day autumn on Lammas and winter on All Hallows The Irish calendar is similar but Spring begins on February 1

In Denmark spring begins on March 1 summer on June 1 autumn on September 1 and winter on December 1 In Australia summer begins on December 1 autumn on March 1 winter on June 1 and spring on September 1

In the Chinese Calendar the solstices and equinoxes are in the middle of each season

Carisbrooke Castle is the Isle of Wights only remaining medieval castle It was built on a Roman site The castle earthworks were begun in 1070 The shell keep was built on the site some 70 years later None of the Norman domestic buildings now remain The gatehouse with its drum towers dates from the 14th and 15th centuries 

In 1377 the French landed on the island but the castle was not attacked 

During Elizabethan times the threat of a Spanish invasion was avoided when the Spanish Armada was turned away at a nearby battle However the castle was considerably altered to resist the new artillery Outer lines of defence were built enclosing the old castle The curtain walls bastions and bulwarks remain in good condition to this day 

Charles I was held prisoner at the castle in 1647 An attempt to escape failed when he got stuck in the bars 

Later the castle was the occasional residence of the governor of the Isle of Wight and it became home to Princess Beatrice youngest daughter of Queen Victoria when she was governor

Atlantis is a name for a large island or small continent that supposedly had been in the Atlantic Ocean a long time ago but sank into the sea and disappeared

The story of Atlantis first appears in the stories Timaeus and Critias by the Greek philosopher Plato In all of his books Plato used many interesting stories to help explain his ideas about government and philosophy No other ancient writer gave specific details about Atlantis until after Plato wrote so most people today think that Plato just made up this story

After Plato the idea of Atlantis was mostly forgotten until 1882 when a writer named Ignatius Donnelly wrote a book saying that Atlantis was real and that the culture of Atlantis had started many other ancient cultures such as the Egyptian and Mayan 

After Donnellys book many people became interested in Atlantis and began to say that it had aircraft submarines powerful energy crystals and other things that are not known from ancient times

By studying the types of rock that are found in the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean scientists are sure that there was never really any large island or small continent there so many people today think that Plato may have heard a story about another place and moved it to the Atlantic Ocean in his book

Different people have thought that many places all over the world have been the place of the real Atlantis Curiously many cultures from around the world who had no contact shared a similar story of a civilization sinking into the sea

Adjectives and Adverbs can be comparative in English and some other languages When people are talking about two or more nouns they can compare them The word which explains how they compare is called the comparative They can also compare actions using adverbs

Examples

Many words can be made into a comparative by adding er to the end of the word 

Words that end with the letter Y can still be made into a comparative but people change the Y to an I and then add ER

Some words cannot be made into a comparative by adding ER Instead we use the word more in front Most of these words have three or more syllables such as beautiful reliable 

If people are not sure about a word it is always acceptable to say more such as more beautiful more expensive

Warning The ER ending and the word more together cannot be used 

Asbestos is a set of six natural minerals The most common form of asbestos is white asbestos which makes up 95 of the asbestos found in buildings It occurs naturally in all parts of the world It is fibrous heat resistant and non flammable These properties made it very attractive as a component in building materials and other products such as insulation and automobile brake pads People have used asbestos throughout history Ancient Egyptian people used asbestos Asbestos is extremely dangerous for human health as it can cause breathing and lung problems if people are around it for a long period of time

Asbestos was linked to cancer in the early 1970s and was replaced by other materials in most applications by 1980

There are six types of asbestos

A syllable is a unit of pronunciation uttered without interruption loosely a single sound All words are made from at least one syllable

Monosyllables have only one vowel sound polysyllables have more than one If a syllable ends with a consonant it is called a closed syllable If a syllable ends with a vowel it is called an open syllable Patterns of syllables can be shown with C and V Closed syllables are shown as CVC open syllables CV Some languages like English have many kinds of closed syllables Some languages like Japanese have few kinds of closed syllables 

Notice that the consonant and vowel notation does NOT match the letters of English spelling in a one to one relationship

There are many words in English that have only one syllable

There are many more words that have two or more syllables

Some languages do not use an alphabet with letters Instead each sign may stand for a syllable For example Japanese can be written using Kana A writing system based on syllables is called a syllabary

An umbrella is a hand tool that is used to stop rain from falling on a person It is also used to make shade and protect people from sunlight An umbrella made for protection from the sunlight is called a parasol

Netnews is a kind of online service that shares articles between a group of computers over a network One kind of netnews is called usenet Usenet was in use before the Internet and is still very active today Usenet provided a way for people to write articles on many different topics and share them with people all over the world It is different from the web because articles are sent to all the computers in the community An article on a webserver stays on one computer until a person gets it with their web browser

The community of computers comprising a Usenet typically does not include those of end users eg home personal computers Rather that community consists of a group of cooperating servers End users must have access to a member of the server community to read and post Such access is typically achieved through the news feature of their email program or web browser or through a special program that specializes in netnews Configuring the program requires the URL of a server and often a user ID and password

The servers in the Usenet community are independent in the sense that each gets to decide what portions of the Usenet they will serve to their users and how long postings will last on the server For example some servers may leave out the adult groups Because postings have to be transmitted from computer to computer a given posting takes some time to be available on all servers Further they may disappear from active groups on busy servers in a matter of days or weeks

Because Usenet groups are frequently used to share large files servers may have bandwidth and download limits If you use a commercial service it may offer a range of limits at different prices

Query your Internet Service Provider to determine whether their servers are members of the Usenet community or whether they provide free access to one of the commercial services that offers access You may have to seek out your own commercial service because many providers have their own alternative AOL and MSN have their Communities ATT uses Yahoo Groups

A netnews service may not even be a community of computers Any user could configure their personal computer to offer a netnews service Organizations often offer their own netnews service independent of Usenet to support their customers and members For example newsmicrosoftcom is a very large community of Microsoft users and developers that help each other out

Netnews groups have a long history and their own netiquette Look for FAQ and netiquette postings to see the rules for any given group

Groups may be moderated or unmoderated Expect a lot of off topic and potentially offensive material on the unmoderated groups which are the majority of Usenet

Diagonal is a kind of straight line A diagonal line does not go straight up down or across 

In mathematics diagonal has different meanings For example in geometry a diagonal is any line that goes between the corners of a polygon So a square has two diagonals and a five sided shape has five diagonals

Kwashiorkor is a type of protein energy malnutrition If a child uses up energy from carbohydrates and lipids their body may begin to use protein for energy 

The body breaks down protein into energy that can be used They then do not have enough protein for other functions in their bodies Children from aged 1 4 years usually get this but rarely adults and older children get it It is common in places like Africa Symptoms include having a pot belly swollen face and hair that is dark then light then dark This can be cured by having a protein rich diet

Popocatpetl is an active volcano and the second highest mountain in Mexico after Pico de Orizaba It is convert5426mft0abbronlkon high People often call it Popo Popocatpetl is the Aztec word for Smoking Mountain Popocatpetl was an Aztec warrior who loved Iztacchuatl Iztacchuatls father sent Popocatepetl to war in Oaxaca He promised him his daughter as his wife if he returned Iztacchuatls father told her that her lover had died in battle She died of sadness When Popocatpetl returned and found out about the death of his lover he killed himself by stabbing a knife into his heart The gods covered them with snow and changed them into mountains Iztacchuatls mountain was called La Mujer Dormida because it looks like a woman sleeping on her back Popocatpetl became the volcano Popocatpetl raining fire on Earth in anger at the loss of his lover

Popocatepetl is one of the most active volcanoes in Mexico It has had more than 20 big eruptions since the arrival of the Spanish in 1519 A major eruption happened in 1947 On December 21 1994 the volcano threw out gas and ash which was carried as far as 25 km away by the wind This led to people having to leave nearby towns Scientists began to check the volcano for an eruption In December 2000 tens of thousands of people were made to leave the area by the government based on the warnings of scientists The volcano then made its largest display in thousands of years

The North Sea is a sea in northern Europe It is part of the Atlantic ocean The North Sea is between Norway and Denmark in the east Scotland and England in the west Germany the Netherlands Belgium and France in the south 

The Skagerrak connects the North Sea to the Baltic Sea In the south the North Sea becomes the English Channel a sea between England and France This is called the Dover Straits and is very busy with ships

The border between the North Sea and the Skagerrak is at an imagined line between Lindesnes in Norway and Hanstholm in Denmark In the North the North sea is open towards the Atlantic The border between the two is an imagined line from Northern Scotland to the Shetlands and then to lesund in Norway According to the Oslo Paris Treaty of 1962 it is a bit more to the west and the north though The treaty puts it at 5 East longitude and 62 North latitude That is at the parallel of the Geirangerfjord in Norway

On average the North Sea has a depth of only 94 metres About 80 million people live near the North Sea at most 150 km away from the coast Together with the English Channel in the south the southern North Sea is the busiest body of water in the world The most ships pass through it

Well known rivers that drain into the North Sea include the Tay the Forth the Tyne the Wear the Elbe the Weser the Rhine and Meuse or Maas the Scheldt the Thames and the Humber 

The Kiel Canal one of the worlds busiest artificial waterways connects the North Sea with the Baltic

Its name comes from its relationship to the land of the Frisians They live directly to the south of the North Sea and to the west of the East Sea the former South Sea and the today reclaimed Middle Sea But the spread of the naming could also be from the view of the cities of the Hanseatic League Some of its main cities like Lbeck Bremen or Hamburg had basically the same view

In classical times this body of water was also referred to as the Oceanum or Mare Germanicum meaning German Ocean or Sea This name was commonly used in English and other languages along with the name North Sea until the early eighteenth century By the late nineteenth century German Sea was a rare scholarly usage even in Germany In Danish the North Sea is also named Vesterhavet meaning Western Ocean as it is west of Denmark

Most of the North sea is on the European Continental shelf On average the depth is about 93 to 94 meters only In the south it is very shallow only 25 to 35 meters In the north in the bathyal zone north of the Shetlands this depth increases to between 100 and 200 metres In the south the depth is at most 50 metres An exception to this is the Norwegian Trench It is deepest there with a depth of 725 metres The most shallow part of it is a sand bank called Dogger Bank In the southern part there are many sand banks

Looking at the satellite picture it is easy to see the geographic divisions of the North Sea

The southern north sea is composed of the Southern Bight before the coast of Belgium and the Netherlands and the German Bight before the coastline of Germany The Dogger Bank is the limit between the southern and central parts The Waddenzee runs all the way from Den Helder in the Netherlands to Esbjerg in Denmark 

The Dogger Bank covers an area about half the size of the Netherlands There the North Sea has a depth of between 13 and 20 metres only The area is very famous for fishing With some storms there are even waves breaking there

The Norwegian Trench has an average depth of around 250 to 300 metres at the entrance to the Skagerrak the depth increases up to 725 meters Along the trench is the Norwegian Current which brings most of the waters of the North Sea into the Atlantic ocean Also most of the waters of the Baltic Sea flow northwards here

About 200 km east of the Scottish city of Dundee there are more trenches known collectively as the Devils hole Generally the water is about 90 meters deep there The trenches very often are only a few kilometers in length In these trenches the depth increases to up to 230 meters 

In the Dover Strait the water is about 30 meters deep At the end of the English Channel this depth increases to about 100 meters

In the last ice age the North Sea was covered by large areas of ice called glaciers About 20000 years ago the ice melted and the North Sea was formed

In the 1960s geologists found large areas of oil and natural gas under the North Sea Most of the oil fields are owned by the United Kingdom and Norway but some belong to Denmark the Netherlands and Germany Drilling began in the 1960s and led to a famous argument between England and Scotland about how the revenue from the oil should be spent

People have been fishing in the North Sea for thousands of years However so many fish are now caught there that new ones may not be able to grow fast enough to keep the fishery going 

Terns Atlantic puffins razorbills kittiwakes and other seabirds live on the North Sea coast Many coastal areas are protected nature reserves

A letter can be different things

There is a paper format called Letter or US Letter It is mainly used in the United States Most other countries use the DIN paper sizes The most common DIN paper size is A4

In some languages for example English we write a letter for all the sounds of the alphabet when we write A B C D etc these are letters or letters of the alphabet Other languages do not use letters for writing Chinese for example uses ideograms 

In English and many other languages the smallest part of writing is the letter We use letters to make words In some languages for example Spanish there is usually one letter for one sound This is easy to read In other languages for example English we can use several letters for one sound or one letter for several sounds This is difficult for learners to read Here are some examples

English French Spanish and many other languages use the Latin alphabet for writing In this alphabet there are often two different letters for a sound For example A and a In other alphabets for example the Cyrillic alphabet there is only one letter for a sound The letters are ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

Annelies Marie Anne Frank Frank is one of the most famous Jewish people who died in the Holocaust Her diary is seen as a classic in war literature and is one of the most widely read books today Several plays and films have been made about it

Anne was born in the city Frankfurt am Main in Weimar Germany She lived most of her life in or around Amsterdam in the Netherlands She was officially seen as a German until 1941 This was when she lost her nationality because of the anti Semitic rules of Nazi Germany She became famous around the world after her death when her diary was printed It showed her experiences hiding during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II

The Frank family moved from Germany to Amsterdam in 1933 This was the same year as the Nazis grew powerful in Germany By the beginning of 1940 because of the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands they were trapped in Amsterdam Persecution of Jewish people increased in July 1942 and the family decided to hide They hid in the secret rooms of her father Otto Franks office building After two years they were betrayed and taken to concentration camps Anne and her sister Margot were later taken to the Bergen Belsen concentration camp There they both died from typhus in March 1945

Otto Frank was the only person in his family who survived He went back to Amsterdam after the war and found that Annes diary had been saved He helped print it in 1947 It was translated from Dutch and first printed in English in 1952 as The Diary of a Young Girl It has been translated into many languages The diary had been given to Anne on her 13th birthday It tells of her life from 12 June 1942 until 1 August 1944

Anne Frank was born on 12 June 1929 in Frankfurt Germany She was the second daughter of Otto Frank a German businessman and Edith Frank Hollnder Margot Frank was her older sister The Franks were Jews and they lived with many Jewish and non Jewish citizens Anne and Margot grew up with Catholic Protestant and Jewish friends The Frank family did not follow all the customs of Judaism Edith Frank was very religious though her husband was more interested in studying He had a large library and both parents encouraged the children to read

On 13 March 1933 elections were held in Frankfurt and Adolf Hitlers Nazi Party won Acts of Antisemitism began almost immediately The Franks were afraid of what might happen to them if they stayed in Germany Therefore later that year Edith and the children went to Aachen They stayed there with Ediths mother Rosa Hollnder Otto remained in Frankfurt but after getting an offer to start a company in Amsterdam he moved there to begin the business and to find a place to live with his family The Franks were included in the 300000 Jews who ran away from Germany between 1933 and 1939

Otto Frank began working at the Opekta Works Opteka was a company that sold pectin Otto Frank found an apartment on the Merwedeplein in Amsterdam By February 1934 Edith and the children had arrived in Amsterdam and Anne and Margot began going to school Margot went to public school and Anne went to a Montessori school Margot liked maths and Anne enjoyed reading and writing Her friend Hanneli Goslar later remembered that from when she was young Anne often wrote though she tried to hide what she wrote and did not like talking about it Margot and Anne had very different personalities Margot was polite quiet and thoughtful while Anne was brave energetic and friendly

In 1938 Otto Frank started a second company Pectacon Pectacon sold herbs salts and mixed spices that were used to make sausages Hermann van Pels worked at Pectacon as a helper about spices He was a Jewish butcher In 1939 Ediths mother came to live with the Franks She stayed with them until she died in January 1942

In May 1940 Germany invaded the Netherlands The government began to hurt Jews by making rules and laws about their freedom The Frank sisters were both studying well and had many friends But a new law that Jewish children could only go to a Jewish school made them move to a Jewish school The companies that Otto Frank worked at still gave him some money but they became poorer It was not enough to support their family

Time recorded in the diary 

For her 13th birthday on 12 June 1942 Anne Frank got a book she had shown her father a few days ago It was actually an autograph book with red and green cloth and a small lock on the front but Frank decided to use it as a diary She began writing in it almost immediately Most of her first writings are about normal parts of her life but she also wrote about some 

In July 1942 the Zentralstelle fr jdische Auswanderung ordered Margot Frank to come to be taken to a work camp Otto Frank told his family that they would hide in rooms above and behind the place where his company worked on the Prinsengracht The Prinsengracht was a street next to one of Amsterdams canals where some of his most trusted employees would help them The notice to Margot made them move a few weeks earlier than they had expected

Annes father Otto Frank was scared that the Nazis would find him and his family He wanted to protect his family He spoke to some of the people who worked in his business One of them was a young woman of about 33 years old and was named Miep Gies Otto Frank needed help  he was going to turn the top floor of his business into a secret hiding place for himself and his family called The Secret Annex Miep and the others would have to help them keep their secret and bring them food They hid in their secret hiding place for two whole years without being discovered by the Nazis Anne Frank left all her other belongings in Frankfurt

Miep agreed to help In 1942 the Frank family together with the Van Pels and a dentist named Fritz Pfeffer moved into the Secret Annex that they had prepared They planned to stay there until the end of the war They hoped the war would end soon but it did not They spent around two and a half years in their hiding place never able to go out into the sunshine During the day they had to be very quiet because the business continued downstairs and not all the workers knew that the Frank family was in hiding in the upper part of the building

A few months before the Franks went into hiding Anne was given a diary for her birthday She called her diary Kitty and wrote in it about all the things that were happening to her and to her family Anne was only a young girl but she knew how to write beautifully She wrote about all the things that young girls think about  how she was getting along with her friends and parents boys her life and emotions After a while Anne had a strong ambition to be a writer She hoped to write a book that everyone would read

After 2 years a thief had come and took not much but after about two and a half years in hiding not long before the end of the war the thief was caught and in exchange of not going to jail or death he told the Nazis that a Jewish family  the Franks  were in hiding Nazi soldiers came into the Franks secret hiding place They sent the Franks and the others to a concentration camp Miep Gies found Annes diary and put it into a drawer She wanted to keep it safe until after the war She hoped that Anne would return and she would be able give her her diary back

However that was not to be Annes father Otto Frank lived through the war and came back to Amsterdam He hoped that his family had survived too  but they had not Of all the family only he survived His wife was killed at Auschwitz Anne and her older sister Margot died at Bergen Belsen concentration camp from typhus a disease  only a few weeks before the camp was freed by the Allied forces Mr Frank lived through much pain And when he got out he found Annes diary and published it

Miep Gies was with Otto Frank when he got the letter telling him that his two daughters were dead Now she knew that Anne would never return for her diary She went to the drawer where the diary was kept and she gave it to Otto Frank People who were close to Anne read the diary They told Otto Frank that he should publish it Anne had wanted to be a famous writer Now people would be able to read her book and they would also learn about the difficult time that the Jews had during the war and about the wonderful people who helped them

Otto had Annes diary printed It became one of the worlds most widely read books It has been printed in over 20 languages and people across the world have read and enjoyed this true story Today for an admissions fee you can visit the house in Amsterdam where Anne Frank and her family hid during the war You can also see the diary that she wrote

In mathematics the Pythagorean theorem or Pythagoras theorem is a statement about the sides of a right triangle

Temperature is how hot or cold a thing is Our bodies can feel the difference between something which is hot and something which is cold To measure temperature more accurately a thermometer can be used Thermometers use a temperature scale to record how hot or cold something is The scale most often used is in degrees Celsius sometimes called centigrade In the USA degrees Fahrenheit are more often used while scientists mostly use kelvins to measure temperature because it never goes below zero

Scientifically temperature is a physical quantity which describes how quickly molecules are moving inside a material In solids and liquids the molecules are vibrating around a fixed point in the substance but in gases they are in free flight and bouncing off each other as they travel In a gas the temperature pressure and volume of the gas are closely related by a law of physics

When they invented temperature scales scientists found there were certain things which were always around the same temperature 

Temperature is not the same as heat Heat is energy which moves from one thing to another Temperature is a measure of the movements of the molecules inside a thing If the thing has a high temperature it means the average speed of its molecules is fast A thing may have a high temperature but because it contains very few or light atoms it has very little heat

The amount of heat that is needed to make a substance one degree higher is called its heat capacity Different substances have different heat capacities For example a kilogram of water has more heat capacity than a kilogram of steel This means that more energy is needed to make the temperature of water 1 C hotter than is needed to make the temperature of steel 1 C hotter

Temperature is also important in weather and climate It is related to the amount of heat energy in the air Isotherm maps are used to show how temperature is different across an area Temperature will be different during different times of day different seasons and in different places It is affected by how much heat reaches the place from the suns rays how high the place is above the level of the sea and how much heat is brought to the place by the movement of winds and ocean currents

Tux is a mascot of the Linux operating system a cartoon penguin made by Larry Ewing in 1996 Wherever he is seen it means such a system can work with Linux He is also a character in some Linux games like Super Tux

Mein Kampf was a book written by Adolf Hitler and Rudolf He Rudolf He helped Hitler write the book but he is not mentioned as an author The book consists of two parts The first part was written by Hitler while he was in jail in Landsberg am Lech He was put in jail after a failed putsch in 1926 He wrote the second part after his release from jail From 1926 to 1930 both volumes were sold separately at the price of 12 Reichsmark each In 1930 both volumes were published as one book 

There were several editions between 1925 and 1945 With each new edition the text was revised as well This was done to clarify those parts of the text that were unclear Probably Ghostwriters around Hitler did this work

In the book Hitler describes his view of greater Germany He also describes his future plan for Jews When he came to power in 1933 he realized some of those plans This resulted in a genocide known as The Holocaust The book was given away for free at civil registry offices during the time when the Nazi government had power in Germany The reason for giving the book away for free was because in part the book was propaganda and giving it away free was a way of trying to recruit members

After the Second World War the book was made illegal to reprint or sell new copies in Germany and Austria It is not illegal to own a book and it is also not illegal to sell or buy such books second hand

Computer graphics are visual representations of data displayed on a monitor made on a computer Computer graphics can be a series of images or a single image

Computer graphics are very useful They are used for movie making video game and computer program development scientific modelling and design for catalogs and other commercial things Some people even make computer graphics as art 

Computer graphics can be 2D or 3D Each subset has its own use but is created in a different way Different computer programs have to be used to make different types of graphics

2D computer graphics are usually split into two categories vector graphics and raster graphics 

Vector graphics use lines shapes and text to create a more complex image If a vector graphic image is made very big on the monitor it will still be as good as its regular size This is one of the reasons vector graphics are liked so much Vector graphics are made with programs like Adobe Illustrator and were used for some older computer games Today they are often used for when computer graphics have to be printed out 

Examples of vector graphics

 ImageTheStructorr Lamborghini GallardosvgA car ImageSparlampesvgA compact fluorescent light bulb 

Raster graphics use pixels to make up a larger image This does not mean the artist has to change a single pixel at a time  raster programs often have tools like paintbrushes paint buckets and erasers to make a picture Programs used to make these include Adobe Photoshop and Corel Paint Shop Pro These are often used as part of what the user sees when she uses a computer program

Sometimes people do use only pixels to make an image This is called pixel art and it has a very unique style

Examples of raster graphics

 ImageThe GunkpngA pixel art image of The Gunk ImageRosa Gold Glow 2jpgPhotographs are raster images 

3D graphics are graphics that look like objects because they are three dimensional This means the computer thinks it has a height a length and a depth and displays them as this Some programs used to make 3D graphics are Bryce 3D Studio Max Maya and Blender and 3D graphics are used many times in movies and TV shows and video games

Examples of 3D graphics ImageGlasses 800 editpngA bunch of drinking glasses ImageElephants Dream s6 bothjpgA picture of the movie Elephants Dream which was made with Blender

Franklin Delano Roosevelt was born on January 30 1882 in the Hudson Valley town of Hyde Park New York

Roosevelt was the Assistant Secretary of the Navy under Woodrow Wilson He was nominated the vice presidential candidate under James M Cox in 1920 Cox and Roosevelt lost to Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge

In 1921 Roosevelt got sick with polio a disease that paralyzes people He never walked again but Roosevelt remained physically fit becoming an avid swimmer Roosevelt became a champion of medical research and treatment for crippling illnesses but kept his illness as hidden as possible from the public fearing discrimination His disability did not limit his political career Roosevelt was elected the Governor of New York in 1928 His wife Eleanor Roosevelt helped his career by traveling and meeting people when Roosevelt could not She became famous as his eyes and ears meeting thousands of ordinary people and bringing their concerns to Roosevelt

Roosevelt won the election against the unpopular incumbent Herbert Hoover and became president in early 1933 

He started a series of popular programs known as the New Deal to fight against the Great Depression The New Deal gave people jobs building roads bridges dams parks schools and other public services Also it created Social Security made banks insure their customers gave direct aid to the needy and made many regulations to the economy Because of this he was re elected in a large victory in 1936 and continued the New Deal The United States did not fully recover from the Great Depression until it entered World War II

Roosevelt was elected a third term in 1940 He gave weapons and money to the Allies fighting in World War II as a part of the Lend Lease program at this time but the United States was still technically neutral in the war During December 7th 1941 Japan launched a strong attack on the Pearl Harbor military base in Hawaii Franklin Roosevelt declared war on Japan and entered the United States into World War II Roosevelt also signed an order allowing Japanese Americans to be sent to internment camps against their will While still president he died on April 12 1945 Vice President Harry Truman became president World War II continued for almost four more months but American victory was already assured

Colombia has made many advances in medicine Many foreigners come to the country to get health services such as organ transplants or plastic surgery Doctor Manuel Elkin Patarroyo of Colombia discovered a medicine against malaria He donated his discovery to be used in Africa and Latin America He did not want to make business of it instead he wanted to use it to help people

The land where Colombia now stands has been home to people for more than 20000 years The first people had many groups cultures and languages There are many tools caves and things of those peoples In Colombia the peoples were similar to those of Asia because the scientists say that the first men came to America from Siberia or South East Asia more than 50000 years ago The peoples of Colombia where called Arawak Caribe and Chibcha But they have many other groups The most famous were the Muiscas El Dorado legend comes from the Muiscas the king of the Muiscas used to bath in the Guatavita Lake and he used a lot of gold for it The Spaniards heard about and the people told them that there was a great golden city somewhere Since then they started to look for El Dorado The International Airport of Bogot is called El Dorado International Airport because the legend was born in Colombia The descendants of the first peoples of Colombia live integrated with others Some groups live in the forest but many live in countryside and in the cities

The Spaniards lead by Christopher Columbus discovered America in 1492 Columbus saw the coasts of Venezuela Colombia and Panama and he gave them his own name But it was Alonso de Ojeda the first to do an exploration in the area of Gulf of Darin After that the Spaniards founded the first European cities in the American continent Santa Marta in 1525 and Cartagena de Indias in 1533 It was from Colombia that the Spaniards conquered the Incas of Peru They founded the city of Popayn in 1536 and they conquered the Confederation of the Muiscas In Bacat the capital of the Muiscas the Spaniards founded the city of Santa Fe in 1538 In 1550 the Spaniards declared the territory as a colony and its capital was Santa Fe de Bogot but in the first decades it depended from Peru Soon after it was declared a Viceroyalty

Antonio Nario was one of the most important persons to lead a movement for the independence of Colombia He was a politician journalist and soldier

On November 11 1810 the city of Cartagena de Indias declared its dependence from Spain

Colombia had an election in May 2006 in which President lvaro Uribe was re elected He will be president until May 2010 Uribe was the first President in Colombia to win a second election in over 100 years

On Saturday August 7 2010 Juan Manuel Santos became Colombias latest elected president Santos won the election on June 20 by a landslide He promised to preside over a government of national unity that will bring social prosperity for all Colombians 

Colombia is known for its coffee coal and emeralds It is also the biggest supplier of Plantains to the United States There are a few armed conflicts in Colombia Most rebel groups finance their operations with the trade of illegal drugs

Abel Janszoon Tasman was a Dutch sea explorer He discovered Tasmania and New Zealand while on voyages in 1642 and 1644 in the service of the VOC He also discovered large parts of Australia 

He was born in Groningen Holland He went to Batavia to work for the VOC in 1633 He went back to Holland in 1636 He went back to Batavia with his wife Jannetie Tjaerss 2 years later He went north to Japan in 1640 In 1642 Tasman went south to Palembang

Tasman set sail from Batavia with the ships Heemskerck and Zeehaen on August 14 1642 He was told to search for New Holland He was hoping to find gold silver and other riches On November 24 1642 he discovered the west coast of Tasmania which he called Van Diemens Land He named it after Anthony Van Diemen Governor General of the Dutch East Indies Tasman sailed around to the east coast of Van Diemens Land and claimed the land for the Dutch on December 3 1642 The ships then sailed west and discovered New Zealand His ships were attacked by Maori in large war canoes and 4 sailors died Tasman then sailed north east to Tonga and Fiji He then sailed north west to New Guinea and got back to Batavia in June 1643

In 1644 Tasman sailed from Batavia with the ships Limmen Zeemeeuw and Bracq He sailed along the west coast of New Guinea and then the coast of Australia from Cape York to North West Cape He went back to Batavia in August 1644 He showed that Western Australia and Queensland were part of the same country He was not able to get through Torres Strait but his maps were used for the next 200 years

Tasman made more trips including to Sumatra in 1646 Siam in 1647 and Manila in 1648 He purchased a lot of land in Batavia where he died in October 1659

Several places have been named after him including Tasmania the Tasman Peninsula Tasman Island and the Tasman Sea

Artificial intelligence is the study of mental processes through the use of computer models The name was made when it was the topic of a 1956 Dartmouth Conference by John McCarthy It is about making computers decision making and train of thought that seems more human McCarthy says that is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines

The idea behind AI is not to make a computer smart by knowing more information It is to build a machine that can act as if it were smart Very often AI is closely connected to mathematical logic the ability to prove things and simplifying mathematical formulae Sometimes AI is meant to be a simulation of human intelligence often as a part of research in the area of psychology

One of the earliest descriptions of AI was the Turing machine A Turing machine is any machine that takes a set of input data performs some fixed calculations that must be chosen before the machine runs and comes out with a predictable output This machine is the basis of modern computers

Thinking machines and artificial beings appear in Greek myths such as Talos of Crete the golden robots of Hephaestus and Pygmalions Galatea Human likenesses believed to have intelligence were built in every major civilization animated statues were worshipped in Egypt and Greece 

A computer programmer is a person who makes computer programs using a programming language Programmers are also called software developers coders or hackers

A programmers main jobs are writing program source code testing if it works and debugging the program if there are problems Programmers often use software tools such as text editors and IDEs to help them work

Programming is a unique profession because a programmer can work from a computer anywhere in the world This is called telecommuting  doing work on the Internet instead of in an office

Some programmers are famous because their software is used by many people One example is Linus Torvalds who created an important part of the Linux operating system

Programming can be done in many different languages and can look very different but do the same thing An example of this is the Hello world program

A programming language is a type of written language that tells computers what to do Programming languages are used to make all computer programs and computer software A programming language is like a set of instructions that the computer follows to do something

A programmer writes source code text in the programming language to create programs Usually the programming language uses real words for some of the commands so that the language is easier for a human to read Many programming languages use punctuation just like a normal language Many programs now are compiled This means that the computer translates the source code into new languages such as assembly language or machine language which are much faster and easier for the computer to read but much harder for a person to read

Computer programs must be written very carefully If the programmer makes mistakes or the program tries to do something the programmer did not design it to do the program might then crash or stop working When a program has a problem because of how the code was written this is called a bug A very small mistake can cause a very big problem For example forgetting a period or typing a plus sign instead of a minus sign can cause a bad bug

There are many types of programming languages Most programming languages do not follow one type alone so it is difficult to assign a type for each language The examples of each type are given in each section below because they are the best well known examples of that type

Declarative programming languages describe a problem but they usually do not say how the problem should be solved The problem description uses logic solving the problem often looks like automatically proving a system of logical axioms Examples for such programming languages are Prolog XSLT LISP and SQL

Imperative programming languages describe a system of state changes At the start the program is in a certain state and the computer is given steps to follow in order to perform an action Following the steps causes the program to change state

In general declarative programming languages are more readable and easier to understand Imperative programming languages are more common because they are easier to use

Functional programming looks at programming like a function in mathematics The program receives input some information and uses this information to create output It will not have a state in between and it will also not change things that are not related to the computation

Procedural programs are a set of steps or state changes

Stack based languages look at the some of the programs memory like a stack of cards There are very few things that can be done with a stack A data item can be put on the top of the stack This operation is generally called push A data item can be removed from the top of the stack This is called a pop You can look at the item at the top of the stack without removing it This is called a peek

If a program is written as push 5 push 3 add pop it will put 5 on the top of the stack put 3 on top of the 5 add the top two values replace the 3 and 5 with the 8 and print the top An example for a programming language that is stack based is the language Postscript

Object oriented programming languages place data and functions that change data into a single unit This unit is called an object Objects can interact with each other but one object can not change another objects data This is usually called encapsulation or information hiding Most modern programming languages are object oriented An example of this is Java

Flow oriented programming sees programming as connecting different components These components send messages back and forth A single component can be part of different programs without the need to be changed internally

Every programming language has rules about what it can and can not do These include

Most languages have official standards that define the rules of how to write the source code Some programming languages have two or more standards This can happen when a new standard replaces an old one For example the Perl 5 standard replaced Perl 4 in 1993 It can happen because two people made two standards at the same time For example there are several standards for APL

Object Oriented Programming is a form of programming where all parts of the program are objects Objects are pieces of memory with the same structure that can be used again and again A bank account bitmap or hero from a video game could all be objects within a program Objects are made up of properties and methods which are things the object can do A Dog object might have properties like height and hairColor Its methods might include bark and wagTail

All objects are created from templates called classes You can think of a class as a mold from which objects are made The class defines all the properties and methods that its objects will have Objects created from a class are called instances of the class A class can extend another class which means that it takes all the properties and methods of the class but can add its own

Here is an example of what a class might look like in a programming language

Notice that the Dog class extends the Mammal class so all dogs will have the properties of a mammal like hairLength and methods like eat or sleep

Object oriented programming is used in many of todays most popular programming languages such as Java Objective C C Python Ruby Javascript and ActionScript

This program asks the user his or her age and responds based on what the user typed If the user typed something that is not a number the program says so If the user typed a number less than zero the program says so If the user says he or she is older than 100 years old the program says Thats old If the user typed a correct age the program says back to the user how old he or she is

Visual Basic is a programming language developed by Microsoft for their operating system Windows

The BASIC language is said to be easier to read than other languages It is a widely understood high level programming language written using simple English like words and syntax

It is an interpreted language code can be run immediately after being written Having an interpreter makes it simpler to use as there is no need for the computer to compile the code possibly finding errors to fix before the compiled version can be run

Once the code is working it can be compiled into an exe file so that it will run on all modern Windows computers whether VB is installed or not The language allows a beginning programmer to produce professional looking Windows applications as it includes drawing tools to create normal Windows forms VB also includes advanced features  concepts and structures which allow programs to be adapted for use with the Internet

Visual Basic was first released in May 1991 for Windows Many versions have been released since then These are listed below

Visual Basic NET is the next series of products in Microsofts successful Visual Basic range of products It makes creating programs easier because it is possible to drag and drop controls into the program

It runs on the NET Framework and features another long line of programs For the full list of editions in the NET series click here

Booting is what happens when a computer starts up When you boot a computer your processor looks in system ROM for instructions and does them They normally wake up add in cards and searches for the boot device The boot device either loads the operating system or gets the operating system from someplace else

People use the word boot to mean to start a computer or other device with electronics built in For example if a person wants to ask a friend to turn on a satellite phone they would say could you boot up the satellite phone

Most operating systems call the first device it uses a boot device This is because the computer is making itself go as in the idiom When we start a computer we can often see the simple instructions the computer uses to start then more complicated pictures or software 

The phrase to boot in this meaning is short for to bootstrap This use is part of net jargon along with similar multi use words like net or web Often the computer is just called a box so a phrase like to boot the box means to start the computer

Tea is a drink that is popular all over the world It is made by soaking the dried leaves or flowers of the plant Camellia sinensis in hot water Tea can have other herbs spices or fruit flavours in it like lemon

Sometimes the word tea is used for other drinks that have been made by soaking fruit or herbs in hot water like rosehip tea or camomile tea 

There are two main types of tea black tea and green 

To make black tea workers take the leaves and spread them out on shelves where they can dry Next they are rolled and broken into pieces and put into a room where they absorb oxygen Chemical reactions change the taste and style of the tea Finally the leaves are dried with hot air until they turn brown or black Most black tea comes from Sri Lanka Indonesia and eastern Africa When black tea leaves are brewed in boiling water the tea made from them looks deep dark red so another name used for black tea especially in China is red tea 

Green tea is made by putting freshly picked leaves into a steamer This keeps them green Then they are crushed and dried in ovens India is the biggest maker and user of green tea

Tea is mainly grown in China India Pakistan Sri Lanka Taiwan Japan Nepal Australia Argentina and Kenya 

Tea can also be used as another word for an afternoon meal as in I am having tea in a short while The word also applies to afternoon tea a small snack meal served sometimes usually featuring sandwiches cakes and tea This small snack meal is also called tea time

Interlingua is a planned language using words that are found in most West European languages It was made by IALA  a group of people that worked on it for more than 20 years and they finished and published the first dictionary in 1951 Interlingua was created on the base of languages English French Spanish Portuguese and Italian

Inter is the same root word like you see in the words interaction interface and so on and it means between or to each other lingua means language They chose the name Interlingua because they wanted it to be used for people of different countries to talk to each other easily Because Interlingua was made by people to be easy it is easier than natural languages to learn

Many thousands of people know Interlingua and Interlingua speakers say that millions can understand it without having to learn it first

There are two other planned langages in the world that have more than 1000 speakers Esperanto and Ido Those two were made before Interlingua Some people think that Esperanto and Ido are easy to learn because they have no exceptions but other people think Interlingua is easier because the makers chose all the words to be easy to understand for people who know English French Spanish Portuguese or Italian plus languages like Occitan and Romanian languages that used to be Latin the language used in Rome a long time ago

Actually people that use Interlingua say that their language is actually new Latin just simpler and modernized

Azerbaijan also includes Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic an enclave which is next to Armenia to the north and east Iran to the south and west and Turkey to the northwest

Most of Azerbaijans land is located in Western Asia and is called an Asian country by the United Nations 

However because it is close and its history is related to Europe Azerbaijan is also a member of a number of European groups including the Council of Europe since 2001

More than 90 of the people are ethnic Azerbaijanis Minorities include Russians Georgians and other minorities Also Shia Islam is by far the largest religion in the country followed by Sunni Islam There are also a small amount of Christians Jews agnostics and atheists

Ancient Azerbaijan was named Caucasian Albania and was relatively independent under RomanByzantine and Persian control 

After the Arab conquest in the 7th century the country has been always under Muslim influence when its population became Muslim until the Russian Empire entered the Caucasus region 

From 1920 to 1991 Azerbaijan was a Communist country as a member of the Soviet Union

Since the early 19th century many Russians settled in Azerbaijan but after the end of the Soviet Union with the independence of Azerbaijan which is back in control most Russians and other minorities have left the country and are continuing to leave the country

An actor is a person who acts or has a role in a movie television show play or radio show Sometimes actors only sing or dance or sometimes they only work on radio A woman actor is also an actress but today most people use the word actor for both men and women

The first time we know an actor worked was in 534 BC probably on November 23rd The changes in calendar over the years make it hard to say exactly when the Greek actor Thespis became the first person to speak words as a character in a play at the Theatre Dionysus This was a big change in storytelling Before then people sang and danced stories but no one had been a person in the story Today we call actors thespians because of Thespis

In the past the name actor was only for men Women only began performing often in the 17th century When they began people called them the actresses In the ancient world and in the Middle Ages people thought it was bad for a woman to act People thought this until the 17th century In the time of William Shakespeare men and boys played womens roles but we think perhaps women also acted secretly 

Today the name actor is for both men and women because some people think the name actress is sexist But people also use the name actress very often

Women actors sometimes act the roles of young boys because in some ways a woman is more similar to a boy than a man is A woman usually plays the role of Peter Pan for example In pantomime a sort of play for children the most important young man is also a woman Opera has some pants roles which women traditionally sing usually mezzo sopranos Examples are Hansel in Hansel und Gretel and Cherubino in The Marriage of Figaro

Mary Pickford played the part of Little Lord Fauntleroy in the first film version of the book Linda Hunt won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in The Year of Living Dangerously in which she played the part of a man 

In comic theatre and film people often use a man for a womans part or a woman for a mans part  this has a long history Most of Shakespeares comedies have examples of this Both Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams were in popular comedy films where they played most scenes as men in womens clothes pretending to be women

Voice acting is a special type of acting It is most commonly used in animation for both television and movies Voice actors are the people who make the voices for the characters They may also create the voices used for narration in non animated works

Muhammad ibn Musa al Khwarizmi was a Persian mathematician who lived in Baghdad around the year 830 He invented algebra and wrote a book about algebra Therefore he is often called the father of algebra He also wrote a book on the Indian numbers and how to add and subtract them During the Middle Ages mathematicians in Europe read his book They called these numbers Arabic numbers and used them instead of the Roman numbers It is easier to do mathematics with Arabic numbers The Roman numbers also has no number zero

He wrote a book on Algebra named Al Jabr Wal Muqibla in which he introduced his own number system And also introduced Arabic numerals His books were translated in Greek and Latin languages They named his books So said Algorizmi The word Algorithm is derived from the word Algorizmi

Muhammad ibn Musa al Khwarizmi worked at the House of Wisdom this is where people worked on translating scientific works

Ptolemy is the English name for Claudius Ptolemaeus He was a Greek who probably lived and worked in Alexandria in Egypt He lived from about 85 to 165 AD He is famous for his work on astronomy and geography

Very little is known about his personal life

He was an astronomer mathematician and geographer He described in his writing the Greek or geocentric view of the universe The Greeks thought that the Earth was the center of the universe He also thought out and described the apparent motions of the planets as they were known in his time

Ptolemy explained and extended Hipparchuss system of epicycles and eccentric circles to explain his geocentric theory of the solar system Ptolemys system involved at least 80 epicycles to explain the motions of the Sun the Moon and the five planets known in his time He believed the planets and sun moved around the Earth in this order Mercury VenusSun Mars Jupiter Saturn 

This system became known as the Ptolemaic system It predicts the positions of the planets accurately enough for naked eye observations so it seemed accurate at the time This is described in his book Mathematical Syntaxis a thirteen book mathematical treatment of the phenomena of astronomy It contains a wide variety of information ranging from earth conceptions to sun moon and star movement as well as eclipses and an explanation of the length of months The Almagest also included a star catalog containing 48 constellations using the names we still use today

In addition to his well known works in astronomy Claudius Ptolemy was very important in the history of geography and cartography He was influential up to the 16th century when his ideas were disproved by Nicolaus Copernicus Ptolemy of course knew that the Earth is a sphere Ptolemys is the first known projection of the sphere onto a plane His Geography remained the main work on the subject until the time of Christopher Columbus But he had Asia extending much too far east which may have been a factor in Columbuss decision to try to reach India by sailing west from Europe

The Ptolemaic explanation of the motions of the planets remained the accepted wisdom until the Polish scholar Copernicus proposed a heliocentric view or sun centered view in 1543 It should be noted too that Ptolemys system is actually more accurate than Copernicuss The heliocentric formulation does not improve on Ptolemys until Keplers Laws are also added

Ptolemy may not actually have believed in the reality of his system He may have thought of it only as a method of calculating positions

Moctezuma II also known as Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin and often called Montezuma in English was the Aztec emperor from 1502 to 1520 His name comes from the Nahuatl Motecuhzoma it means he who is leader because of his fury In Spanish he is called Moctezuma

When Hernn Corts arrived in Mexico in 1519 Moctezuma thought he was the god Quetzalcoatl and did not want to fight against him Corts took Moctezuma prisoner When the Aztecs wanted Corts to get out of their capital Tenochtitlan in 1520 Cortes told Moctezuma to calm down his people When doing that he died The Spaniards said he was killed by the Aztecs while the Aztecs said Corts killed him The Spanish said that the Aztec people threw rocks at him killing him this was the Spanish The Aztecs said that they found his body in the streets with a lot of cuts made with a sword after the Spanish left His own tribe killed the first Moctezuma

Antonio Lpez de Santa Anna Prez de Lebrn was a Mexican general and dictator Under his rule of Mexico it lost half its territory Santa Anna was 11 times president He fought two wars against the United States In the war against the Texas he won the famous battle of the Alamo but later he lost the battle of San Jacinto and was taken prisoner by the Americans He also lost the second war with the United States

Apartheid was a political system in South Africa which was in use in the 20th century mainly between the 1940s and the 1980s In the system the people of South Africa were divided by their race Even though black people were the majority in the country a small number of white people ruled them and held most political offices There were laws that kept up the racial separation The system of apartheid in South Africa was banned in 1994 The last president under apartheid was Frederik Willem de Klerk After this Nelson Mandela became the first non white president Both were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts Today the term apartheid is sometimes used to speak about similar systems in other countries

During apartheid people were divided into racial groups and kept apart by law The system was used to deny many rights of non white people The laws allowed the white minority to keep the black majority out of certain areas Black people had to carry special papers or have permission to live and work in particular areas The government separated mixed communities and forcibly moved many people Many laws were made for example people of different races were not allowed to get married black people could not own land and black people could not vote 

Many countries and the United Nations did not agree with the South African governments policies There were protests in South Africa like in Sharpeville in 1960 and in Soweto in 1976 The Soweto uprising started because Africans were forced to study some subjects at school in Afrikaans Many black people did not like Afrikaans because it was not the first language of black people but the language of the apartheid government

Finally after much struggle the South African government ended apartheid in 1994 After that equal rights were shared among both black and whites Nelson Mandela stood up to apartheid and became president when apartheid was ended Although granted equal rights since 1994 90 percent of the countrys poor people are non white and so poverty remains a big problem

Apartheid is an Afrikaans word meaning separateness

The aim of apartheid was to separate all the people of South Africa into small independent nations But the National Party government did not want to spend a lot of money on this project Also they wanted to keep most of South Africas land for white people Especially the rich parts of the country like the gold mines of Johannesburg They also wanted black people to work in these mines for little money However they did not want black mens families to live in the same area

The Dreyfus Affair was one of the biggest scandals in the history of France It happened at the end of the 19th century It was about Alfred Dreyfus a Jewish officer in the French army

In 1894 Dreyfus was accused of being a spy and accused of crimes against France People thought he wrote letters to the Germans telling them about secrets of the French army 

His punishment was to be sent to a prison island in South America for the rest of his life

When he was in prison people thought he was innocent They proved that another soldier Major Esterhazy was guilty But the army did not want to admit that it had been wrong They refused to free him Finally the evidence that Dreyfus was innocent became so strong that the government had to demand a new trial But at the new trial the army again found him guilty But the President of France who did not want an innocent man to suffer any more pardoned Dreyfus in 1899

Dreyfus was released Seven years later he was officially declared innocent and allowed back into the army

The affair divided France into people who thought Dreyfus really was a spy and people who thought he was innocent Many of those who thought Dreyfus was a spy hated Jews and believed that he was a criminal because he was a Jew and that a Jew could not be a good Frenchman this belief is called anti Semitism Others thought that the army could not be questioned The other side believed that an innocent man should not be imprisoned and feared that Dreyfuss enemies were also enemies of France

Baseball is a sport played by two teams that each have nine players In baseball one team throws a small round ball called a baseball and the other team tries to hit it with a club called a bat Teams get points by running and touching markers on the ground called bases 

Many people in North America South America and East Asia play baseball In the United States baseball is called the national pastime because so many people in the United States spend a lot of time playing or watching games

Baseball got started in the United States in the 1700s and 1800s Historians are not sure exactly who invented it

A game of baseball is played by two teams on a baseball field Each team has nine players There are also umpires who watch everything carefully to decide what happened and make sure everyone follows the rules 

On a baseball field there are four bases The bases form a line that goes around the field to the right from the starting base The starting base is called home plate Home plate has five sides First base is on the right side of the field second base is at the top of the infield third base is on the left side of the field and home plate is at the back of the field where the catcher plays In major league games there are usually four umpires with one standing near each base In important games like playoffs two more umpires are usually added and stand farther down each baseline toward the outfield

The game is played in innings Professional and college baseball have nine innings In an inning each team has one turn to bat and try to score runs worth one point When one team bats the other team plays defense and tries to get three players on the other team out The team that is playing defense always has the ball This is different from other team sports When the team on defense gets three players out it is their turn to hit Then the team that was batting starts playing defense and the team that was playing defense starts batting After nine innings the team that has the most runs is the winner If the teams have the same number of runs they play more innings until one team wins At the start of the game the home team pitches while players on the visiting team bat Only one player can bat at a time

The baseball field or diamond has two main parts the infield and the outfield The infield is where the four bases are The outfield is beyond the bases from the view of home plate The lines from home plate to first base and home plate to third base are the foul lines and the ground outside of these lines is called foul territory A ball that is hit with a bat and flies between the foul lines is a fair ball A ball that is outside the foul lines is a foul ball and if caught in the air by the team on defense is an out If the ball hits the ground in foul territory rather than being caught in the air the batter continues to bat and anyone on base must return to their base If the batter has fewer than two strikes a foul ball counts as a strike

The most important part of the game is between the pitcher and the batter The pitcher throws or pitches the ball towards home plate The pitcher normally throws the ball close enough for the batter to hit it If the pitcher throws the ball over home plate and between the hitters knee and chest the pitch is a strike unless the batter hits the ball The pitch is always a strike regardless of where it is if the batter swings the bat and misses so the batter must have good aim with the bat Three strikes are a strikeout and this is one way to make an out A pitch that the batter does not swing at and which is not a strike is a ball On the fourth ball thrown by a pitcher the batter walks to first base so it is important to pitch well 

The catcher for the pitchers team waits behind the batter and catches any ball that the batter does not hit The catcher uses signals to tell the pitcher where to throw the ball If the pitcher does not like what the catcher says he will shake his head which signals no If he agrees with what the catcher has signaled he will nod his head which signals yes

There are many ways to get batters out and runners can also be gotten out Some common ways to get batters out are catching a batted ball in the air whether in fair or foul territory throwing the ball to the defensive player at first base and a strikeout Common ways to get a runner out are tagging the runner while the runner is not on a base and a force out When the fielding team has put out three of the batting teams players the half inning is over and the team in the field and the team at bat switch places

The batting team wants to get runs In order to get a run a player must bat then become a base runner touch all the bases in order and then touch home plate So first the batter wants to make other players get to home plate or to run the bases himself The batter also tries to hit the ball between the foul lines so that the fielding team cannot get anyone out After the batter hits the ball if it lands outside of the foul lines it will be called a foul ball

A base runner who touches home plate after touching all previous bases in order and without getting out scores a run

If the batter hits the ball over the fence without touching the ground it is a home run The batter and any base runners are allowed to advance to the home plate and score a run The fielding team can do nothing to stop them

The team in the field tries not to let the team at bat get any runs The fielding team has a pitcher and a catcher This pair is often called the battery The remaining seven fielders may stand anywhere in the field However there are usually four infielders that stand around the infield close to the bases and three outfielders who stand around the outfield

The four infielders are the first baseman second baseman shortstop and third baseman The first baseman and third baseman stand close to first base and third base The second baseman and the shortstop stand on either side of second base

The first basemans job is to make force plays at first base In a force play another infielder catches a ball that has touched the ground and throws it to the first baseman The first baseman must then touch the batter or the base with the ball before the batter can touch first base Then the batter is out First basemen need to have quick feet stretch well be quick and know how to catch wild throws First base is one of the most important positions as 90 of the plays are there

The second basemans job is to cover the area to the right of second base and to back the first baseman up The shortstops job is to cover the area between second and third bases This is where right handed batters usually hit ground balls The shortstop also covers second or third base and the near part of left field The shortstop is usually the best fielder on the team The third baseman needs to have a strong throwing arm This is because many times the batter will hit a ball toward third base The third baseman must throw the ball very quickly to the first baseman to get the runner out Because the balls that go to third base are usually hit very hard the third baseman must also be very quick

The three outfielders are called the left fielder the center fielder and the right fielder because they stand in left field center field and right field Left field and right field are on the left and right sides if you look out from home plate Center field is straight ahead from home plate Center field is very big so the center fielder is usually the fastest The center fielder usually decides who should catch fly balls

The team can decide where to put the infielders and outfielders Players often shift their positioning because of how the game is going They may change positions at any time

Teams can change pitchers during a game Teams change their pitchers often because its hard for a pitcher to do a full game of nine innings A pitcher can sometimes throw a no hitter where no one on the opposite team gets a earned hit A team can use as many pitchers as it wants to but it is rare to use more than eight in a game The ways that a pitcher throws the ball are called pitches Most pitchers use two or more different pitches Pitchers change their pitches so that the batter will not know exactly what kind of pitch will be thrown This makes it more difficult for the batter to hit the ball Pitchers can make the ball move differently faster or slower closer or farther from the batter higher or lower Pitches are usually categorized into three categories fastballs change ups and breaking balls

There are many types of breakoff speed pitches such as the slurve curve slider splitter sinker screw 2 seam cut 2 seam screw knuckle knuckle curve change up circle change up palm ball and others

When throwing the ball the pitcher must touch the pitchers rubber with his foot The pitchers rubber is on top of the mound So the pitcher cannot take more than one step forward when he throws the ball That makes the pitcher throw the ball slower Most major league pitchers can throw the ball up to ninety miles per hour Throwing a baseball that fast can be bad for the body Pitchers can end up with a lot of injuries

The batting team wants to get runs The batting team sends its players up to home plate in a special order This order is called the lineup Each team chooses its lineup at the start of the game After the game starts the team cannot change the order But the team can use a player who was not on the lineup The new player has to change with an original player The new players name is written in the lineup where the original players name was After the ninth player has batted the first player in the lineup starts again If a runner comes to home plate he scores a run Then he is not a base runner After scoring a run the player must leave the field until it is his turn again So a player can only score one run for each time he bats

Since people began to have more free time baseball has become the national pastime of America About 12 million people play baseball in the United States

Richmond began as an important village of the Powhatan Confederacy and was briefly settled by English colonists from Jamestown in 1609 and in 161011 English settlers returned to found a permanent town in 1737 It became the capital of the Colony and Dominion of Virginia in 1780 During the Revolutionary War period the city was known for Patrick Henrys Give me liberty or give me death speech in 1775 at St Johns Church and the passage of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom written by Thomas Jefferson During the American Civil War Richmond served as the capital of the Confederate States of America The city entered the 20th century with one of the worlds first successful electric streetcar systems

The American Civil War also known as the War Between the States was a civil war in the United States of America Eleven Southern slave states declared their secession from the United States and formed the Confederate States of America also known as the Confederacy Jefferson Davis led the Confederate states as they fought against the United States The Union states were all those in which slavery was not legal and five states in which slavery was legal

In the presidential election of 1860 the Republican Party led by Abraham Lincoln was actively against expanding slavery beyond the states in which it already existed The Republican party won in that election This made seven Southern states declare their independence from the Union even before Lincoln became president on March 4 1861 Both outgoing President James Buchanan and Lincoln disagreed with the legality of the secession considering it rebellion No nation ever recognized the Confederacy as a separate nation

Fighting started when the Confederates bombarded a Union fort within the territory claimed by the Confederacy The war was fought mostly in the South and because both sides were American was one of the deadliest in US history The Union won the war resulting in the end of slavery in the United States

The Confederate States claimed ownership of all forts and other federal buildings within their territory Fort Sumter in South Carolina remained in Union hands On April 12 1861 Confederate forces bombarded and forced the surrender of Union forces inside the fort Following this President Lincoln called for volunteers from each state to take back the captured forts defend Washington DC and suppress the rebellion Swiftly four more states joined with the Confederates rather than supply forces to suppress them

There were two important areas where the American Civil War was fought  in the west and in the east 

In the eastern area there was the US capital Washington DC and the Confederate capital Richmond Virginia These two cities are only about 90 miles apart In this area the Confederate military leader from 1862 until the end of the war was Robert E Lee Lee was a great general and won many battles Many times his actions prevented the smaller number of Confederate troops from being badly beaten or destroyed by the Union troops Even though the North had more soldiers they could not capture Richmond until the end of the war in 1865 

In the western area there was the great river the Mississippi Ulysses S Grant won many battles here One of the earliest battles to take place in the western area was the Battle of Shiloh The North captured almost all the cities on the Mississippi River but the Confederacy still held Vicksburg an important city and fort On the 4th of July 1863 following a long siege Vicksburg surrendered to Grant This divided the Confederacy into two This victory is considered to be one of the turning points of the war

There were also battles west of the Mississippi River in the area called the Trans Mississippi Two battles which are considered important are the Battle of Wilsons Creek and the Battle of Pea Ridge After the Union captured Vicksburg this area became isolated from the rest of the South

Another major turning point occurred at about the same time in the east After several victories General Lee decided to invade the North Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia went into Pennsylvania The Confederate army met the Union army near Gettysburg Pennsylvania The Battle of Gettysburg was fought over a three day period July 1 3 in 1863 The invasion was stopped by Grant and Lee and the Confederate army were pushed back to the South 

Lincoln decided that Ulysses S Grant was his best general He put Grant in control of all the Union armies and made William T Sherman general of armies in Georgia While Grant attacked Lee again and again Sherman burned Atlanta and Savannah Lee held out time and time again but eventually the number of Union soldiers was too much for the smaller Confederate army Lee decided he had too few soldiers to keep on fighting and he surrendered to Grant on April 9 1865 near Appomattox Court House

Following Lees surrender many other Confederate armies surrendered as well The last Confederate general to surrender was Brigadier General Stand Watie on June 23 in Oklahoma Some Confederates did not want to become part of the United States again these people moved to Mexico and Brazil

Inflation occurred on both sides The prices on everything were raised and caused people in both the North and the South to go hungry if they could not afford the newly priced food This suffering was an important factor in the Souths surrender

Many soldiers died for both sides during the war The South was hurt the most because most of the war was fought there The Souths economy was hurt very badly too The Union Army stayed in some Southern states for many years This time is called Reconstruction Reconstruction ended in 1877

Also soon after the war several constitutional amendments were made by the US government and passed with enough support from the people Slavery was ended by the 13th Amendment The 14th Amendment makes it clear that all people born in the United States are citizens with equal rights that cannot be taken away unless they do something against the law The 15th Amendment says that people in the United States cannot be kept from voting because of their race Other facts are that Generals Grant Hayes Garfield Harrison and McKinley became presidents or ran for the office

Tutankhamun was a Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt from about 1334 BCE to 1323 BCE He became Pharaoh of the 18th dynasty during the New Kingdom at 9 years old Tutankhamun ruled only 9 years and died very young at 18 so he is known as The Boy King He was married to his half sister Ankhesenamun daughter of Queen Nefertitihis step mother

The word independence means not having to depend on anyone or anything else It also means to be strong and be able to survive alone The word is usually used in a good way

Anything can be independent When people talk about independence it is usually about people countries or different areas of science

A country gets its independence when it is no longer part of another country Sometimes countries get their independence in a war like when the United States beat Britain in the American War of Independence Countries can also get their independence peacefully like Canada did Help from another country may be needed to get independence like in World War II when the allies freed many countries that had been controlled by armies of Nazi Germany Italy and Japan 

Singapore gained independence from Malaysia in 1965 The newest country to get its independence was Montenegro In June 2006 it became independent from Serbia and Montenegro This was done by a peaceful vote although many other countries in the area fought wars Other countries that became independent not long ago are Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992 Eritrea in 1993 and East Timor in 2002 However some countries have political parties that discuss whether their country should become independent Some examples of these are the Scottish National Party or the Puerto Rican Independence Party

Anubis is the Greek name for the ancient god in Egyptian mythology who looks like a man with the head of a jackal Jackals are predators that look like dogs and live in Africa

People did not like jackals in ancient Egypt because the animals messed up graves The Egyptian people wanted to end this by deifying themfactdateJuly 2010 Deifying means in this case that they created a god that was a jackal as well Therefore the god of the dead Anubis looked like a dog or jackal Anubis was the god of the dead because the jackals were often in graveyards at night This made the people think that the jackals protected the dead people in the graves The priests who mummified the dead kings were also dressed up as jackals Now that the jackal had become a holy animal dogs and jackals were kept as pets in the temples After their death they were mummified and placed in the temples Anubis was the protector of the mummies against the challenges in the netherworld After a while Anubis became solely the god of mummification because he invented mummification by using it to preserve Osiris Because Osiris was the first mummy and the first to go to the netherworld he became king of it The Egyptian people believed that Anubis helped with the ceremony that was performed with people once they arrived in the netherworld In this ceremony the heart of the dead was weighed against the feather of truth to see if the deceased had been a good person in life If they had been a bad person in life then they would go to a place where there would be food floating above their heads just out of reach If they ever got close to reaching it then demons would dig holes at their feet that they would fall into so that they could never get their hands on the food

In later times during the Ptolemaic period as their functions were similar Anubis came to be identified as the Greek god Hermes becoming Hermanubis The centre of this cult was in uten haSa ka Cynopolis a place whose Greek name simply means city of dogs In Book XI of The Golden Ass by Apuleius we find evidence that the worship of this god was maintained in Rome at least up to the 2nd century Indeed Hermanubis also appears in the alchemical and hermetical literature of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance

Although the Greeks and Romans typically scorned Egypts animal headed gods as bizarre and primitive Anubis was sometimes associated with Sirius in heaven and Cerberus in hell

Atum was the creator of everything in ancient Egyptian mythology He represented the very first history nothing existed yet except for him According to the myth he rose up out of the chaotic waters of Nu and used his own female side to create Shu and Tefnut For a while his two children were lost at sea Atum sent his removable eye the Udjat Eye to go look for them When they returned Atum cried tears of joy Where these tears hit the ground is where men formed Out of the two elements water and air the other gods and goddesses were born The Egyptians believed he was the father of all the gods Atum was fist the partner of the earth then the partner of the setting sun

Warships come in many different sizes Here is a list of different kinds of warships from the largest to the smallest of World War II

A submarine is a special kind of warship able to go under the sea 

An aircraft carrier is like an airport on a ship

Modern warships come in the same class of ship as they did in World War II but the sizes are different From largest to smallest

Other warships are used to supply ammunition food and other supplies to the larger warships Some warships exists because they have powerful computers that can spy on nearby ships Usually these kinds of ships are smaller and do not have many guns or missiles themselves

An equilibrium market price is the price at which there is no tendency for it to change 

When price is lower than the equilibrium price quantity demanded will be greater than quantity supplied There will be a tendency for the price to increase

When price is higher than the equilibrium price quantity supplied will be greater than quantity demanded There will be a tendency for the price to decrease

Equilibrium market price is attained when the quantity demanded equals quantity supplied It is sometimes called market clearing price

The Latin motto E pluribus unum was suggested by the first Great Seal committee in 1776 The preferred English translation is Out of many one Consultant and artist Pierre Du Simitire chose the Latin motto and his design expresses this theme

This motto was well known to literate Americans of the 18th century It appeared in the Gentlemans Magazine published monthly in London since 1731 The legend E pluribus unum was used on the title pages of the annual volumes that contained a collection of the years twelve editions of the magazine

In Thomsons 1782 sketch for the final design Charles Thomson put this motto on a scroll held in the bald eagles beak

E pluribus unum is a clear reference to the thirteen colonies united into one nation symbolized by the shield on the eagles breast As explained in the official description of the Great Seal the thirteen vertical stripes represent the several states all joined in one solid compact entire supporting a Chief which unites the whole represents Congress The Motto alludes to this union

Samba is a kind of music dancing and singing originally from Brazil It began as a musicdance movement in the 1920s

Samba is a lively rhythmical dance of Brazilian origin in 24 time In ballroom dance there are three steps to every bar making the samba feel something like a 34 timed dance The timing is one a two with the values about one beat 14 beat 34 beat

There are two main types of samba that differ from each other the modern ballroom samba and the traditional samba of Brazil Traditional Brazilian samba includes the samba which is danced solo at Carnival In that case the dancers take just one step on each beat

The ballroom samba has its origins in Brazil at the beginning of the 20th century Many steps can be traced back to the Maxixe danced in 1910s A book published in France in 1928 already described how to perform the samba The modern ballroom dance was created in England mostly with steps adapted from those seen in Brazil This version is now danced all over the world in international competitive dancing as regulated by the World Dance Council

Ballroom samba like other ballroom dances is a form adapted for its suitability as a partner dance The dance movements which do not change depending on the style of samba music being played borrows some movements from Afro Brazilian traditional dances such those used in candombl rituals

The ballroom samba is danced to music in 24 time The basic movements are counted either 1 2 or 1 a 2 and are danced with a slight bouncing action This action is created through the bending and straightening of the knees with bending occurring on the beats of 1 and 2 and the straightening occurring on the a Samba is notable for its constantly changing rhythms however with cross rhythms being a common feature Thus common step values

The following applies to the type of samba done during street carnivals where the musicians will move along with the dancers sometimes on foot sometimes on a motorized float or platform

The music is played with different instruments bass drums snare drums a whistle other types of untuned percussion and different varieties of bells

Other sections are when the apito blasts one rhythm and all other instruments respond using another rhythm called a call and response section and a Samba piece can have instrument solos when one instrument is playing an exciting rhythm The apito caller signals the end of one section and the beginning of the next by blasting a short call Pieces always have clear beginnings and ends

Ballroom sambas are usually played by standard ballroom dance bands with one or two extra percussion instruments

A nuclear weapon is a weapon that suddenly releases the energy in the nucleus of certain types of atoms When triggered these devices release a huge amount of energy in the form of an explosion Nuclear weapons are also known as atomic bombs atom bombs or A bombs Nuclear weapons are very powerful and one nuclear weapon can destroy a city They get their energy by changing some of their matter into energy This is called a nuclear explosion Nuclear explosions are difficult to ignite and control and require uranium or plutonium that has been enriched for reactive isotopes These isotopes are not concentrated enough in natural uranium to cause explosions

The first nuclear weapons were created by the United States during World War II and used against the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan This is the only time in history when nuclear weapons have been used in combat This development was called the Manhattan Project The Manhattan Project took place in Los Alamos New Mexico The first atomic bomb was tested at the Trinity site at White Sands in southern New Mexico

Nuclear weapons are made from the elements uranium or plutonium Certain forms of these elements can be made to undergo nuclear fission and have a nuclear chain reaction This produces a very large amount of energy and radiation and will kill any people or animals within several kilometers Much of the radiation is X rays which heats air to produce a huge nuclear fireball The rapid expansion of the fireball produces a dangerous shock wave that destroys houses or buildings even several kilometers away It will eventually kill people farther away than several kilometers depending on how much radiation the person received The mutations in the DNA cause cancer and radiation poisoning Nuclear bombs release fallout which is nuclear material and dust that has been irradiated and became radioactive This poisonous dust is blown by the winds for tens or hundreds of kilometers and can remain dangerous for several years

A hydrogen bomb or fusion bomb is a nuclear weapon which utilizes hydrogen isotopes as another type of fuel Hydrogen bombs can be many hundreds of times more powerful than fission bombs Despite the name in hydrogen bombs in use the hydrogen is only there to produce enough neutrons to also detonate a casing made of natural uranium The fuel in hydrogen bombs is thus mostly unrefined uranium

The delivery of the nuclear weapon to its target is as complex as making one A nuclear explosive device can be placed in a bomb or into a missile which is called a nuclear missile Nuclear bombs can be carried by aircraft Nuclear missiles can be carried by aircraft submarines or trucks or they can be placed into underground missile silos Strategic bomber aircraft like the B 36 Peacemaker B 52 Stratofortress and B 2 Spirit are used to carry nuclear weapons They are also carried by missiles such as intercontinental ballistic missiles or submarine launched ballistic missiles Some missiles travel to the border of space and then launch a number of separate nuclear weapons back toward the ground and each one can travel to a different target This is called a MIRV Warhead or Multiple Independent Reentry Vehicles Very large nuclear bombs have been produced by in practice a MIRV can produce as much damage from several smaller explosions

Nuclear weapons cost a lot of money to make because the materials they are made of are very rare and it takes many scientists to make them But many countries have managed to create nuclear weapons Many countries in the world possess nuclear weapons today In the order that they first made nuclear weapons they are United States Russia United Kingdom France China India and Pakistan Israel is thought to also have nuclear weapons but the government says they do not Many people said that North Korea had nuclear weapons and they have said that they do but now they say that they will not make any more In North Korea held their first official nuclear test South Africa once had nuclear weapons but now says that it has destroyed them all Iran is believed to be making nuclear weapons but they say they are just making nuclear energy When countries get or try to get nuclear weapons it is called nuclear proliferation Some of those countries may have lost their nuclear weapons There are 92 atom bombs lost at sea from all countries with a nuclear arsenal The bombs were lost in 15 different cases However there could be more lost bombs

Diamonds are actually made of pure carbon the same chemical element as graphite fullerene and coal But diamonds are very hard and in crystalline form

Because many diamonds are beautiful people make jewelry using them

Diamonds are very effective electrical insulators but also very good conductors of heat

Diamonds are made deep in the earth where there is an intense amount of pressure and heat that makes the diamond form The intense heat and pressure is forming the liquid ore to make volcanic eruptions which surfaces and becomes diamond crystals Sometimes magma having diamonds will come near the top of a volcano People find diamonds where volcanoes were a long time ago Sometimes people find diamonds on the top of the ground But in places like South Africa they must dig deep down into a diamond mine to get diamonds Diamonds were first found in India

In 1863 Abraham Lincoln set aside the last Thursday of November as a national Day of Thanksgiving American immigrants brought the customs and practices of the American Thanksgiving to Canada beginning on April 5 1872 The United States Congress permanently established the fourth Thursday of each November as a national holiday in the year 1941 and Canadian Parliament later established the second Monday of each October as a national holiday in the year 1957

Although not as famous the first day of Thanksgiving actually took place at Berkeley Hundred Virginia in 1619  a year before the Mayflower brought the Pilgrims to Massachusetts

The Pilgrims were early settlers on the east coast of North America They traveled from England on a ship called the Mayflower and made their new home in what is now Plymouth Massachusetts 380 km northeast of what is now New York 

Many of the Pilgrims died during their first winter in North America They were cold and did not have enough food The following year though the Native Americans who were from the Wampanoag tribe helped them grow crops At harvest time in the winter of 1621 they were very thankful that they had a good crop of food to eat during the coming winter They thanked God and the Indians for teaching them how to grow the local foods

They invited three of the Wampanoags who had helped them to their feast They were Squanto Samoset and Chief Massasoit The Wampanoags brought their families This was over 90 people There were so many people that the Pilgrims did not have enough food to make the meal so the Wampanoags brought along their own food for the feast

The Wampanoags brought turkey duck fish deer berries squash and cornbread They also brought vegetables that they had farmed and shown the Pilgrims how to care for

The Thanksgiving holiday is a four day holiday over the weekend Families and friends usually eat a special meal together This meal also usually includes mashed potatoes cranberry sauce pumpkin pie several casseroles and stuffing The food eaten today for Thanksgiving is very different from the food that was eaten at the First Thanksgiving in 1621

Every year prizes called Nobel Prizes are given to people who have done very well in different areas These areas include Literature Science and Peace They were established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel which dictates that the awards should be administered by the Nobel Foundation For many people winning a Nobel Prize is a very special thing in their lives People who have won a Nobel prize are called Nobel laureates

Each prize winner gets a medal a diploma and a sum of money that has changed over the years In 1901 the winners of the first Nobel Prizes were given 150782 SEK which is equal to 7731004 SEK in December 2007 In 2008 the winners were awarded a prize amount of 10000000 SEK The awards are presented in Stockholm in an annual ceremony on December 10 the anniversary of Nobels death

The Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel sometimes called the Nobel Prize in Economics was not a part of Nobels will It was started in 1969 by Sveriges Riksbank the Bank of Sweden Since this prize was not in Nobels will and is not paid for by his money it is not a Nobel Prize However it is awarded together with the other Nobel prizes

Since the establishment of the Nobel Prize four people have received two Nobel Prizes

As a group the International Committee of the Red Cross has received the Nobel Peace Prize three times in 1917 1944 and 1963 The first two prizes were specifically in recognition of the groups work during the world wars and the third was awarded at the year of its 100 Year Anniversary

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has won the Peace Prize twice in 1954 and 1981

A number of families have included multiple laureates

A graph is a picture designed to express words particularly the connection between two or more quantities You can see a graph on the right

A simple graph usually shows the relationship between two numbers or measurements in the form of a grid If this is a rectangular graph these two measurements will be arranged into two different lines at right angles to one another One of these lines will be going up The other one will be going right These lines meet at their ends in the lower left corner of the graph

Both of these axes have tick marks along their lengths You can think of each axis as a ruler drawn on paper So each measurement is indicated by the length of the associated tick mark along the particular axis

Another word for graph is chart or diagram However a chart or a diagram may not relate one quantity to other quantities Flowcharts and tree diagrams are examples of charts or diagrams that are not graphs

Lets say you wanted to make a graph showing your height as you were growing up You might show your height in centimeters on the vertical axis and your age in years on the horizontal axis

For example say you were 60 centimeters tall at age 1 85 centimeters tall at age 2 and 95 centimeters tall at age 3 You would draw an imaginary straight line passing through the 50 centimeters height mark on the vertical axis Then you would draw a second imaginary line passing through the age of 1 year on the horizontal axis At the place where the two imaginary lines meet you would then draw a dot Really the imaginary lines are usually replaced by graph paper The drawing of this intersection is called plotting the point 50 centimeters for year 1

You would then plot 85 centimeters for year 2 and 95 centimeters for year 3 If you had more heights for more years you would plot years 4 5 and so forth When you had enough points on your graph you could draw a line through each of the plotted points making your graph a line graph For example the line graph at the upper right shows the unemployment rate on the vertical axis and the year on the horizontal axis

Lets say you wanted a single graph showing both your height and your brothers height This could be expressed as two sets of plotted points one for you and one for your brother You could use different colors to tell your plot from your brothers Or you might plot the Gross Domestic Product as a second line against the same years on the unemployment graph above This would show you the relationship between GDP and unemployment

Graphs make information easier to see This is especially true when two or more sets of numbers are related in some way

For example the unemployment rates graph at the beginning of this article could be expressed in the form of a table Like this

But a long string of numbers makes it difficult to see the underlying meaning It is much simpler to understand when the table is expressed in the form of a graph In particular it is easier to see the relationships between the two sets of data For example by looking at the graph you can see at a glance that unemployment was relatively low in the late sixties but relatively high in the early eighties

Scientists and engineers use graphs so that they can get a better understanding of the broad meaning and importance of their data Salesmen and businessmen often use graphs to add importance to their points in a sales or business presentation Graphs with many plotted points may be created on a computer rather than being drawn by hand

Mathematicians use graphs that plot themselves without taking measurements For example the formula x y says that the value of x will always be equal to the value of y If you plot this formula as a graph with x as the horizontal axis and y as the vertical axis you will get a graph that looks like a straight line angled at precisely 45 degrees The use of these graphs forms a branch of mathematics called analytic geometry

Usually graphs are created on specially designed paper called graph paper This paper has evenly drawn horizontal and vertical lines on it On the right is an example of a sheet of graph paper

Different types of graphs require different forms of graph paper What we have been talking about in the article above is the commonest form of graphs and graph paper It is known as rectangular or Cartesian graphs However the evenly drawn vertical and horizontal lines on the paper are not the graph itself but are part of the graph paper The graph is the set of plotted points along with its axes

There are various types of graphs other than Cartesian These include bar graphs pie graphs polar graphs scatter graphs three dimensional graphs logarithmic graphs and many others

Collision detection is a program used on computers to help it understand when two objects will hit into each other When a computer shows two things on the screen or controls two things in real life it sometimes needs a special program to detect where objects to understand where things are This might be used to help make sure things like planes do not hit each other or just to display a videogame 

It is also called CD or interference detection

Berkeley Software Distribution is a kind of the UNIX operating system that is distributed for free since 1989 It was started by people in Berkeley California USA in the year 1977 Now people from around the world work on it

There are many different kinds of BSD that many people have worked on Some of them are NetBSD FreeBSD OpenBSD and Mac OS X

Jacques Cartier was a French trader and explorer He was born on December 31 1491 in Saint Malo a small town in Brittany and lived until September 11557 He sailed three times to Canada looking for gold 

He was the first European man to see Prince Edward Island the St Lawrence River and also Hochelaga where the Wendats and other First Nations tribes lived In 1534 he reached Newfoundland and explored coast of Labrador

European countries raced to take the land and riches from the New World Spain and Portugal were already getting large profits when King Francis I of France asked Jacques Cartier to take a ship to the Americas Cartier was a good sailor from Saint Malo where many people knew about sailing to the New World for fish 

Cartier sailed to what is now Canada in 1534 His men took the sons of a Wendat chief Donnacona with him to France on his first trip On his second trip he brought them back but later captured chief Donnacona and took him to France where Donnacona died 

On his third trip he brought French people to try to make a French colony on Wendat land The Wendats were not as friendly to the French as on his first two visits so after many hardships they had to go back to France 

Because Cartier first led the French to visit Canada the French later said they had a right to control Eastern Canada

Vasco da Gama was a Portuguese sailor He was the first European who went to India through the Cape of Good Hope the southern end of Africa He went to India three times by ship

His exact date of birth was unknown but he was said to have been a knight in the 1490s at Sine Portugal

On July 8 1497 four ships left Lisbon and his first trip to India began Before him no European had sailed past South Africa even though another Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias had already been that far Since it was almost Christmas time da Gamas crew gave the coast they were passing the name Natal a name it keeps today 

By January they had reached modern day Mozambique a coastland of East Africa controlled by Arabs as part of the Indian Oceans network of trade They were chased away by an angry crowd who discovered they were not Muslims and continued north to Kenya There at Malindi da Gama was able to employ a pilot from India who brought the Portuguese the rest of the way to Calicut on the southwest coast of India on May 20 1498 He left a few Portuguese in Calicut and was asked by the ruler of that city to leave everything he owned too but he escaped and returned to Portugal in September 1499

He sailed on his next trip in 1502 after he found out that the people of Calicut had killed the Portuguese he had left behind On this trip he plundered all the Arab and Indian ships he found in the Indian Ocean then went on to Calicut and took over that city capturing much wealth This made the King of Portugal very happy with him

He went on one last trip in 1524 to be the viceroy of the colony that the Portuguese had in India by that time but he died soon after he got there on Christmas Eve

Kayseri is a city in the center of Turkey Kayseri used to be called Mazaka or Kaisareia The city has a population of nearly 1 million Famous meals in this city are pastirma sucuk and manti Erciyes mountain is the third highest mountain in Turkey It is 3917m high

The city of Kayseri consists of the following metropolitan districts

A lava plateau is a flat wide surface that is formed when lava comes out of the ground and spreads out very quickly The lava layers form a lava plateau These are general properties of lava plateaus

One example of a lava plateau is the Columbia Plateau in Washington Oregon and Idaho in the United States Its area is 63000 square miles and is 6000 feet thin 

Iodised salt is table salt mixed with tiny amounts of iodine and is used to prevent disease of the thyroid gland

People only need a very small amount of iodine to prevent disease Food crops usually get iodine from the soil but some places around the world have low amounts of iodine Iodised salt is a very cheap and good way of getting the necessary iodine

Ordinary table salt is a chemical compound called sodium chloride Sodium iodide is added to the NaCl to make iodised salt

College is a kind of school or university a place where people go to learn skills for future jobs Most people go to college right after high school but other people choose to go later in life

College is a career choice that most people make because it will help them to earn more money and live better lives

In some countries for example the United Kingdom college also means a house belonging to a university where students and teachers live together

A battery is a device that can store electricity Some are rechargeable and some are not They store direct current electricity

A battery really means two or more wet or dry cells connected in series for more voltage or in parallel for more current although people often call a cell a battery AA AAA C and D batteries all have 15 volts The voltage of a cell depends on the chemicals used while the amount of power or current it can supply also depends on how large the cell is a bigger cell of a given type can supply more amps or for a longer time

The chemical reactions that occur in a battery are exothermic reactions and thus produce heat For example if you leave your laptop on for a long time and then touch the battery it will be warm or hot However the batteries used in laptops are called lithium ion batteries and they sometimes do have a fire hazard 

Batteries come in lots of different shapes and sizes and voltages It is possible but not easy to run wires to use an odd size battery for an odd purpose

Batteries are always more costlyexpensive than mains electricity But mains electricity is not suitable for things that are mobile

Bicycles have tail lights that can be operated by batteries and sometimes by a little generator powered by the wheels

Hand and foot generators can be used to replace batteries in various devices but they can be tiresome

Wind up generators are now available to power small clockwork radios clockwork torches etc

Since clockwork clocks have been around for hundreds of years and batteries for two hundred it is amazing that no one thought of a clockwork torch until recently

Rechargeable batteries are recharged by reversing the chemical reaction that occurs within the battery But a rechargeable battery can only be recharged a given amount of time Even iPods with built in batteries cannot be recharged forever Moreover each time a battery is recharged its ability to hold a charge is degraded a bit Non rechargeable batteries should not be charged as various caustic and corrosive substances can leak out such as potassium hydroxide

The very first batteries were invented in the Middle East around 1000 BC Then they were buried and forgotten about

The first battery was invented in 1800 by Alessandro Volta Nowadays his battery is called the voltaic pile

Later batteries were bottles with a fluid and some metal rods in them People had to be careful not to turn these batteries upside down so the fluid would spill

In modern batteries the fluid is soaked up in a kind of paste And everything is put in a completely tight case Because of this case nothing can spill out of the battery An exception is car batteries they still have liquid inside

A knife is a metal tool with a sharpened metal blade that is used to cut all sorts of things The plural form of knife is knives

There are many kinds of knives depending what to be cut With the right knife the cuts you want to make will happen faster and easier With the wrong kind of knife it will take more work to do the same amount of cuts When a knife is too small to cut something a saw axe or power tool may be needed 

Carrying knives is illegal in many countries especially if the blade is longer than several inches Another type of knife which is illegal in many places is the switchblade a knife that has a button which when pressed activates a spring to open the knife

Nyngan is a town in New South Wales Australia It is built on the banks of the Bogan River It is convert160kmmi0lkonabbron north west of Dubbo and convert190kmmi0lkoffabbron south east of Bourke in the Central West Plains of New South Wales It is a town of 2500 people It exists because of the people who work on the farms and in a copper mine 50 kilometres to the west 

It remains also well known as one of the last depots of Cobb and Co the famous inland transporter of the 19th century One of the overnight depots was at Nyngan because it is about half way between Dubbo and Bourke In the days of Cobb and Co the trip from Dubbo and Bourke would have taken at least 4 days 

However the route they took is not the route that is used today The new route runs beside the railway The railway is a direct line from Dubbo to Nyngan There is not a single bend for almost 160 kilometres In the other direction the track goes 190 kilometres dead straight the whole way to Bourke

Film may refer to

Photographic film is a sheet of plastic used to record pictures The plastic has been specially treated so it is sensitive to light That way it is possible to record an invisible image with the plastic when it is exposed to light Normal film is shipped in small canisters that protect it from the light A normal photographic film can hold up to 40 pictures Once all pictures have been recorded the film has to undergo a special chemical treatment This is called developing a film Through that treatment the pictures become visible and the exposed film is no longer sensitive to light Different kinds of films exist Some require more light to be exposed than others There are also special films which can record infrared light 

Film can only be used once After that it cannot be used again When not in use the film needs to be covered from light otherwise it will record any lights that shine on it This will make it useless to record a picture later on Film comes in a can called a canister to cover it from light rays Film needs the right amount of light to make a picture If the picture is too bright or too dark it will not record correctly The longer that the film keeps recording the more light it will get If what is being photographed is bright it will be recorded faster If it is darker the film will need more time to record Films that need less time to record the picture are known as faster films Different speeds of films are marked with an ISO number The higher the number the faster the films Usual ISO numbers for films are 100 200 and 400 Films can only make a picture from focused lights If there is no lens to focus light the film will only turn white from receiving just the light If a film with an ISO level of 200 instead of 100 is used it will only need half as much time to record a picture of the same scene

Films also come in different sizes The usual camera film comes in metal cans or canisters but there are other camera films that come in paper wrappings or in single sheets

Compass can mean one of two things

A magnetic compass points in the direction of the North Pole

A compass is very useful for navigating on oceans and in deserts or other places where there are few landmarks

The first compass was invented by ancient Chinese in the Han Dynasty It was a large spoon like magnetic object made of magnetite ore set upon a square bronze plate

A drawing compass is a drawing tool that can draw circles and arcs on sketches and diagrams There is the mechanical and normal compass The mechanical compass is a compass that has a mechanical pencil and the other is a compass that requires you to screw a pencil on to one end yourself adjusting the length manually 

It consists of two legs joined at a hinge

One leg contains a sharp point used to centre the compass while it turns

The other leg contains some kind of screw fixture that can hold a pen or pencil

A divider is a drawing compass with two pointed ends and is used to mark out distances and lengths

The divider is so called because it can be used to divide a length in two using theorems of Geometry

Ferdinand Magellan Portuguese Ferno de Magalhes Spanish Fernando de Magallanes was a Portuguese sea explorer He became the first European who sailed on the Pacific Ocean and the first to sail a ship around the entire world Magellans voyage proved that the Earth was round 

He was born in Oporto on 1480 He worked in a royal court where he learned many important skills including map making navigation and astronomy In 1505 he joined the navy When he worked for Portugal he went to many parts of the world such as India the Spice Islands East Africa and Morocco After he lost his job for the King of Portugal he went to work for the King of Spain

He was also the first to sail through the Strait of Magellan so it was named for him Magellan himself was killed in the Philippines because he had traded with them with iron and fruits and thought somehow they were stealing He ordered his crew to start a fire and some islanders died which started the fight The other 18 sailors led by Juan Sebastin del Cano survived the entire voyage and returned to Spain in 1522 This was the first ship known to sail around the world One of the crew Henry a Malay interpreter who was picked up by Magellan on his earlier trip for Portugal became the very first person known to travel all the way around the world when they reached his home country and he stayed there

Prince Henry the Navigator was a prince from Portugal He was called Infante Dom Henrique in Portuguese He was never a navigator himself He got his name because he organized many ocean voyages on which lands were found He is seen as the man who started European colonial expansion He is also known for opening a navigation school in Portugal so tools and ships could be made better Henry the Navigator also discovered the first shipping routes directly from Europe to Asia for the Portuguese monarchy

Concrete is an important material for making all sorts of buildings and structures It is a composite made of Portland cement sand gravel or aggregate and water in varying proportions depending on the task 

Concrete is used more than any other man made material in the world As of 2006 about 75 billion cubic meters of concrete are made each yearmore than one cubic meter for every person on Earth

The ingredients are mixed together into a paste a bit like making dough for bread The concrete is then poured into a frame After a few hours it sets hard Concrete solidifies due to a chemical reaction known as hydration The water reacts with the cement which bonds the other components together eventually creating a strong stone like material 

Concrete is strong in compression but weak in tension For some purposes it needs to be reinforced with steel rods These rods can be galvanised to prevent rusting and corrosion

Concrete is used to make pavements pipe architectural structures foundations motorways bridges multi story parking walls footings for gates fences and poles and even boats Its biggest advantage is that it bonds together bricks and stones better than any other method known to mankind 

Concrete is as old as 5600 BC It was not invented by Romans but much used by them Some kinds of concrete are waterproof and some kinds even set underwater

Reinforced concrete buildings can be made to link all the parts together the foundations walls floors and roofs but concrete construction does not make buildings earthquake proof

There are many additives to make concrete better set faster set slower make stronger reduce corrosion and so on The Romans discovered that adding volcanic ash produced a concrete which would set under water The Romans also knew that adding horse hair made concrete less liable to crack as it set and that adding blood made it more frost resistant

Modern concrete was made in 1756 by British engineer John Smeaton He added pebbles and powered brick to the cement In 1824 English inventor Joseph Aspdin invented Portland cement which has remained the main cement used in concrete production He burnt ground up limestone and clay together The burning process changed the chemical properties of the materials and Aspdin created a stronger cement than plain crushed limestone alone could produce

The 19th century saw the invention of reinforced concrete by French gardener Joseph Monier in 1849 This is concrete with steel bars in it called rebars Glass fibre or plastic fibre is beginning to replace steel bars

Many modern chemicals can be added to the mixture to achieve special objectives Superplasticizers are chemicals which improve workability which means the ability to shape the concrete before it has set Pigments can change the dull grey colour Corrosion inhibitors can reduce rusting on the steel bars Air entrainment is blowing little bubbles in the concrete before it sets This helps the concrete survive the freezing and thawing of a cold climate

Safety measures can decrease the likelihood of injuries and death

A marathon is a long distance running sport event where an athlete must run 42195 kilometres There are many marathons held all over the world each year It is a very difficult event and runners are advised to run many miles before they compete This event was named after the famous Battle of Marathon 

In 390 BC there was an important battle in Greece There was an army from Persia that came to fight the army from Athens The battle was held at a place called Marathon The army from Athens was not expected to win but they did After the victory they sent their best runner a man named Pheidippides back to Athens to tell everyone the good news but he died of exhaustion He ran about 25 miles back to town In 1896 the first modern Olympics was held There was a race called the Marathon there It was only about 25 miles then 

The Holy Roman Empire was a group of regions and free cities in central Europe which all came under the rule of an emperor who was elected by the princes and magistrates of the regions and cities within the empire When Charlemagne died his Frankish Empire was given to his children and divided into three different countries West Francia Lotharingia and East Francia The Holy Empire started when Otto I of East Francia became Holy Emperor in 962 and it was ended by Napoleon in 1806 The emperors claimed to be heirs of Charlemagne and that the Empire dates from 800 when Charlemagne became Frankish Emperor

In the 16th century the Holy Roman Empire had to deal with the rebellion of the Frisians lead by Pier Gerlofs Donia and Wijerd Jelckama This lasted from 1515 until 1523

In the 17th century the Empire was shattered by the Thirty Years War Nearly thirty percent of the population of the Empire was killed The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation lost parts of its territory

Until the 13th century the Holy Roman Empire was powerful Later all the duchies and counties inside the Empire started to get more power At the end the Emperors did not have a lot of real power any more and the country existed only in name

Voltaire a French philosopher in the 18th century once joked that the nation was neither holy nor Roman nor an empire

Friesland is a province in the north of the Netherlands The capital of Friesland is Leeuwarden People in Friesland speak Frisian and Dutch The Frisian language is also spoken in a small part of Groningen and in East Friesland and North Friesland in Germany In North Holland there is a region called West Friesland but people who live there are not called Frisians

Agriculture and tourism on the lakes and the isles in the Wadden Sea are important sources of income

The province is also famous for its ice skaters and also for the Elfstedentocht an ice skating race of 200 kilometers

In Friesland the Frisians live They are an old ethnic group Members of this ethnic group are 

Groningen is a province in the Northeast of the Netherlands At the east is the German region Lower Saxony in the south is Drenthe in the west is Frysln and in the north is the Wadden Sea

The capital of Groningen is also called Groningen People from Groningen often call Groningen City stad and the rest of the province Ommelanden

Important source of income are agriculture and natural gas extraction Slochteren 

Noticeable things in Groningen are the dialect that is related to Low German and the strong support for the communist party in the Northeastern part of the province

Groningen is

Burgundy is a historic region in eastern France The capital of Burgundy is Dijon

It was named for the Germanic Burgundian tribe who migrated there from an island in the Baltic as the Roman Empire fell apart and set up a kingdom with its own laws This included part of what is now Switzerland

During the Middle Ages Burgundy was ruled by dukes In the 15th century it was very powerful but after duke Charles the Bold died when he wanted to conquer the city of Nancy in 1477 Burgundy was taken by France It was a province until 1790 It is now an administrative rgion

Someone who is a Duke is part of the nobility In monarchies like the UK the title has legal status and is inherited in the male line 

The first English dukes were created by Edward III in 1337 when he gave his eldest son Edward the Black Prince the title of Duke of Cornwall

Dukes are formally referred to as The Duke of Westminster and addressed as Your Grace On State occasions dukes rank below Royal Dukes and above Counts This is called the order of precedence because in procession to the opening Parliament or on other state occasions they walk in order of their rank 

The wife of a duke is a Duchess This is an honorary title given for life to the lawfully wedded wife of a Duke If she divorces and remarries a commoner their children bear no title The children of a duke on the other hand do bear honorary titles The eldest son may bear what is called a junior title which an ancestor was given before the dukedom was created Other children would be called Lady Jane and Lord James Children use the family surname not the Dukedom

The land that is ruled by a duke is a duchy 

The son of a duke inherits the duchy when the duke dies

The word comes from the Latin word dux which means leader

Latin is an old language that was spoken by the Romans and others Latin is a dead language This means people do not speak or write this language very much any more However many students around the world study it in school Latin is the mother of all Romance languages This means that all Romance languages were developed from Latin Speakers of Spanish Italian French Portuguese and other Romance languages may understand some Latin words

Latin is the language of the Vatican People in the Roman Catholic Church sometimes use Latin for communication and sometimes in ceremonies

Latin is also used by zoologists and botanists to name and describe every new species Plants and animals are usually named in writing related to zoology and botany by giving a Latin name alongside the name in a modern language The Latin name is the one that has a precise agreed definition Many other words used in science and medicine were created from Latin words or are Latin words

There were two types of Latin Classical Latin and Vulgar Latin Classical Latin was the kind of Latin used by the educated Romans and is the one used by the Roman Catholic Church and studied by many students around the world Vulgar Latin on the contrary was the more common spoken variety used by the Romans

Latin was the most important language in most of Europe in the Middle Ages It was taught in many European schools and all universities used Latin as the teaching language Latin began to lose its importance in the Reformation but it was still often used by authors of scientific books and encyclopedias Until about 1900 many universities accepted dissertations written in Latin

Some languages spoken today came from the Latin language Those languages are called Romance languages The five largest Romance languages are French Romanian Italian Portuguese and Spanish Other Indo European languages are related to Latin The Romance languages are very close to each other and it is possible for the speakers of one Romance language to understand another to at least some extent For example the speakers of Portuguese can well understand Spanish It can be said that the Romance languages are modern dialects of Latin

Latin has almost the same structure as Ancient Greek It uses a different alphabet though 

Latin has seven different noun cases nominative accusative genitive dative ablative and locative The vocative case is almost always the same as the nominative case Latin nouns are declined or changed according to how they are used in the sentence A noun can be declined five different ways These ways are called declensions The declensions are numbered 1 through 5 and each one has unique endings that identify the nouns declension When a noun is declined ten forms are made two for each of the noun cases

Verbs also have a similar thing done to them changing a verb is called conjugation When a verb is conjugated six forms are made There are 6 factors that can change a verb person number tense aspect voice and mood In all there are 120 possible forms for Latin verbs

Latin used to be written on plates of wax These had little space so words were run together Sometimes papyrus was used but this was expensive Punctuation and lowercase letters are a modern invention

The following is the introduction to the Metamorphoses by Ovid it describes the Golden Age

English translation

This was the Golden Age that without coercion without laws spontaneously nurtured the good and the true There was no fear or punishment there were no threatening words to be read fixed in bronze no crowd of suppliants fearing the judges face they lived safely without protection No pine tree felled in the mountains had yet reached the flowing waves to travel to other lands human beings only knew their own shores There were no steep ditches surrounding towns no straight war trumpets no coiled horns no swords and helmets Without the use of armies people passed their lives in gentle peace and security

The Middle Ages are a time period in European history They started around the year 476 CE when the Western Roman Empire ended and continued until around the time Christopher Columbus discovered the New World in 1492 The Middle Ages are called this because it is the time between the fall of Imperial Rome and the beginning of the Early modern Europe This period of time is also known as the Medieval Age the Dark Ages or the Age of Faith To be exact the term Dark Ages refer only to very early period from 476 to 800

Across Europe the fall of the Roman Empire after the invasions of different barbarian tribes devastated towns and cities and their inhabitants The Dark Ages are given this name because during this period of time Europe was in disarray and it was not fun to live there Much of the knowledge that the Romans used was lost The Dark Ages period was marked by mass migrations wars and plagues Fortunately it was not long and lasted only some 300 years Emperor Charlemagne was crowned in 800 and he promoted order education and civilization Europe began slowly regain what was lost during those centuries

During the Middle Ages Europe changed as the remains of a great empire slowly became independent countries

During the high Middle Ages wealth began to return and consumers began to demand luxuries again Silk porcelain spices incense gold and gems all travelled thousands of miles across long stretches of deserts mountains and plains Glass was in turn imported from Europe to East

Trade was greatly interrupted several times during the Crusades due to the aggression between Muslims and Europeans and because of Mongolian Invasions and later because of the Black Plague It is thought that the Mongols brought the Plague with them from Asia and devastated the world population from 1348 1351 Almost a third of the worlds population was killed by the plague at this time although the Americas were completely spared from the disease 

Buddhism is a non theistic religion that is based on philosophy It originally began in India but is almost entirely gone from that area now Muslim invaders drove out this system of beliefs more or less forcing Buddhism to flee East

During the Middle Ages the Mongols created the worlds largest empire controlling much of Asia Middle East and what is today far eastern Europe Mongolia was so large and powerful that its strength lead to the Pax Mongolica similar to the Roman Pax Romana In other words the Mongol empire was so powerful that it created a period of time that saw no war only a great deal of international trade and diplomacy along the Silk Road

 O say can you see by the dawns early light 

What so proudly we hailed at the twilights last gleaming 

Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight 

Oer the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming 

And the rockets red glare the bombs bursting in air 

Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there 

O say does that star spangled banner yet wave 

Oer the land of the free and the home of the brave 

On the shore dimly seen thro the mist of the deep 

Where the foes haughty host in dread silence reposes 

What is that which the breeze oer the towering steep 

As it fitfully blows half conceals half discloses 

Now it catches the gleam of the mornings first beam 

In full glory reflected now shines on the stream 

Tis the star spangled banner Oh long may it wave 

Oer the land of the free and the home of the brave 

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore 

That the havoc of war and the battles confusion 

A home and a country should leave us no more 

Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps pollution 

No refuge could save the hireling and slave 

From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave 

And the star spangled banner in triumph doth wave 

Oer the land of the free and the home of the brave 

Oh thus be it ever when freemen shall stand 

Between their loved homes and the wars desolation 

Blest with victry and peace may the Heavn rescued land 

Praise the Powr that hath made and preserved us a nation 

Then conquer we must when our cause it is just 

And this be our mottoIn God is our trust 

And the star spangled banner in triumph shall wave 

Oer the land of the free and the home of the brave

In chemistry a salt is any neutral chemical compound made of cations bound to anions The main type of salt is sodium chloride

Solutions of salts in water are called electrolytes Electrolytes as well as molten salts conduct electricity

Salts can melt ice

A salt can also be defined as an ionic compound which dissociates forming a positive ion other than hydrogen ion and a negative ion other than hydroxyl ion is called a salt

The word Salt in English often means table salt or edible salt This kind of salt is made up mostly of sodium chloride It is one of the few minerals that are eaten a lot by humans but it can be used for other things besides giving food its flavor

There are different kinds of edible salt unrefined salt refined salt and iodized salt It is a crystalline solid that has the color white pale pink or light gray It is usually taken from sea water or rock deposits Natural sea salt has little parts and pieces of other minerals besides sodium chloride Rock salts that can be eaten are sometimes a little grayish in color because of these other minerals

Sodium and chlorine are the two elements that make up sodium chloride Both of these are needed for all living creatures including humans but they are not always eaten in the form of salt where they are found together in large amounts Some peoples like the Yanomami tribe in South America eat very little salt Salt is used to control the amount of water in the body Salt flavor is also one of the basic tastes Salt cravings may be caused by not having enough minerals like sodium chloride in the body

Eating too much salt can make health problems more likely to happen for example high blood pressure When food is made salt is used as a preservative to make the food last longer and as a seasoning for flavor

There are different ways to make table salt

Because salt can make things last longer using it was one of the important things that let civilization get started in places like Egypt Salt was probably used there as long ago as 4000 BC In ancient times salt was worth much more because it was hard to get and could be used not only to give foods flavor but also to make them last longer Food could now be kept past its season and taken on long trips

People often traded salt for other things It was of high value in China Greece the Middle East and Africa In the Mediterranean area including Ancient Rome salt was even used for money The word salary comes from the Latin word for salt because they paid people in salt After people learned how to get salt from the ocean salt became cheaper The Phoenicians were some of the first to figure out how to do this by pouring seawater on dry land Then when it dried they collected the salt and sold it

Another use of salt was in war as a way to punish a city by ruining its crops This is called salting the Earth The Assyrians are said to have been one of the first to have done this to their neighbours

A business is a method of organizing work where one or more people offer to sell products or services to other people for more money than it costs them to make or give it The word business comes from the word busy and means being busy

Some businesses are created to get more money for the owner of the business others are created to give a service without getting more money just to deliver the service and get some money

The number of people who work for a business can be as low as one such as a barbershop in a small village or as many as hundreds of thousands of people all over the world such as a company like Microsoft which makes computer software and some small electronic goods

Some businesses do not need a fixed location such as an office or a store A carpenter or an electrician who works for himself usually brings everything they need for work in their truck Fishermen who stay out at sea work out of their boats

Death penalty also called capital punishment is when a government or state executes someone usually because he or she has done a serious crime such as murder

The death penalty is a disputed and controversial topic

About one third of the countries in the world have laws that allow the death penalty The United States The Peoples Republic of China Japan and Iran are examples of countries that have a death penalty Canada Australia Mexico and all members of Council of Europe are examples of countries that have abolished the death penalty

Over half the countries in the world have gotten rid of the death penalty in law and practice 75 countries have gotten rid of the capital punishment for all crimes and another 20 can be considered abolitionist in practice The latter retain the death penalty in law but have not carried out any executions for the past 10 years or more

Most of the countries that have a death penalty use it on murderers and for other serious crimes such as rape or terrorism Other countries especially ones with Authoritarian or Totalitarian governments however also use it for smaller crimes like theft or for saying bad things about the government

A study done in 2005 found that the following countries did the most executions

It is common to have people executed for crimes like murder but there are also other crimes that carry the death penalty Some of these are

During war time the following crimes are often punished by death

According to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that became valid in 1976 people that were not at least eighteen years old at the time they committed the crime may not be executed According to the European Convention on Human Rights specifically its 13th amendment no one must be executed 

Some people think the death penalty is a good thing and others think it is a bad thing Many people on both sides of the argument have very strong feelings One side says the death penalty is good because it scares people away from doing things that could get them killed the other side says theres a potential of executing an innocent man one says justice retribution and punishment the other side says that execution is murder Most people know the threat of crime to their lives but the question lies in the methods and action that should be used to deal with it Throughout human history governments and rulers have used many death penalty methods to execute people such as crucifixion flaying and hanging Some methods like crucifixion and flaying are no longer used by governments because people think that these methods of killing are too cruel The gas chamber was found unconstitutional in the United States and is no longer usedIt can also be used in certain states for varying offenses

The Council of Europe has abolished all death penalty by 13th amendment of the European Convention on Human Rights Amnesty International oppose all death pernalty on ground of the right to life and prohibition of all tortures or any cruel inhuman or degrading treatment insisted by Universal Declaration of Human Rights

The following forms of execution are in use today

Mining is the process of taking things from the ground Any material that cannot be grown must be mined Mining things from the ground is called extraction Mining can include extraction of metals and minerals like coal gold silver platinum copper and iron Mining can also include other things like oil and natural gas

Some mining is done by scraping away the soil from the top of the ground This is called strip mining Some mining is done by going deep underground into a mine shaft This is called underground mining Some mining such as gold mining is done in other ways Gold can be mined by searching in the bed of a river or other stream of water to remove the flakes of gold This is called panning or placer mining

A bomber is a type of airplane that is used to attack ground targets mainly by dropping bombs The first bombers were made at the start of World War I

Bombers usually fly low to the ground and can fly at slow speeds Because of this bombers are not outfitted to fight other airplanes To make up for this bombers have many guns 

Bombers in World War II had large crews sometimes as many as 12 people Usually a bomber had a pilot a bombadier a co pilotnavigator a nose gunner a gunner on the bottom which could shoot forwards and back a tail gunner a top gunner and a couple of side gunners

Bombers now have one or two people in them The other positions have been replaced by computers Bombers have very few guns on them partly because they are much faster In bombing missions now the pilot drops a bomb and leaves as quickly as possible In the Vietnam War bombers were made that could travel at Mach 2 or Mach 3 so a nuclear bomb could be dropped without killing the people in the airplane This tactic was never used obviously but it changed the purpose of bombers

A condom is a thin cover that is put on a mans penis and used during sexual intercourse It is normally made of latex Condoms are a form of birth control they can prevent a pregnancy They can also prevent the spread of certain sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea syphilis or HIV Another name for a condom is prophylactic sheath 

In 2009 most condoms were made of latex For people with latex allergy plastic condoms are available

The first condoms were made of tissue Later models were made of the intestines of animals such as sheep Such condoms can still be found sometimes Certain people prefer sheepskin condoms over latex ones because sheepskin condoms can transfer body warmth better However they do not prevent diseases as effectively as regular condoms

Condoms are rolled up when they are packaged and are meant to be rolled over an erect penis They are most commonly made of latex but are available in other materials Condoms normally have an expiration date on them Condoms weaken after this date and may not work properly Condoms are also not designed to be used more than once

Nowadays women also can use condoms Like male condoms they increase protection for partners from pregnancy and STDs Female condoms look like a sheath with a flexible ring on both sides of this sheath With these rings the condom is attached to the vagina It covers the vagina and cervix to prevent sperm from getting inside the womans uterus It is necessary to know that female and male condom should not be used at the same time In this case both condoms may rub against each other and this will result in failure

There are two ways to see how effective condoms are They are method effectiveness where how many couples that use the condom every time they have sex properly do not get pregnant are looked at and actual effectiveness where the number of people that use condoms either correctly or incorrectly and do not get pregnant are looked at Most studies show results of effectiveness over a year

The method failure rate of condoms is 2 per year The actual failure rate is different in different places and the rates can be anywhere between 10 and 18 per year

The piano is a musical instrument with a keyboard A normal piano has 88 keys Pianos use the keys to move hammers that hit strings inside making a sound Pianos come in two basic shapes grand pianos and upright pianos The piano has been an extremely popular instrument in Western classical music since the late 18th century A person who plays the piano is called a pianist

The piano was invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori of Padua Italy He made his first piano in 1709  It developed from the clavichord which looks like a piano but the strings of a clavichord are hit by a small blade of metal called a tangent  In the piano the strings are hit by a hammer Even though the player had more control over dynamics and note length it was too quiet to be popular The early keyboarded instruments such as the clavichords harpsichords and organs that were used at that time had a much shorter keyboard than they do today This means they had fewer octaves this means that music can be played however will be played and sound with a smaller range of pitch Gradually the keyboard became longer until it had the 88 notes of the modern piano

At first the instrument was called the fortepiano This means loud soft in Italian It was given this name because it could be played either loudly or softly depending on how hard the note was hit Later this name changed to pianoforte This is normally shortened to piano The word fortepiano is sometimes used to describe the pianos of the late 18th and early 19th centuries In some languages such as Russian fortepiano is the normal word for a piano

Although the piano was invented at the beginning of the 18th century it was not until 50 years later that it started to become popular The first time the piano was played in a public concert in London was in 1768 when it was played by Johann Christian Bach The upright piano was invented in 1800 by John Isaac Hawkings Seven years later T Southwell invented overstringing This means that the strings for the low notes go diagonally across the soundboard so that they can be longer and make a much bigger sound

The early pianos had strings that were fastened to a frame made of wood They were not very heavy but they were not very strong or loud so they could not be heard very well in a big concert hall  In 1825 the cast iron frame was invented in America This made the piano much stronger so that it could make a bigger sound and the strings were not likely to break

A piano has a keyboard with white keys and black keys When a key is pressed down the damper comes off the string and a hammer hits the string It hits it very quickly and bounces off so that the string is free to vibrate and make a sound When the player takes his finger off the key the damper falls back onto the string and the sound stops The strings are stretched very tightly across the frame passing over a bridge on the way The bridge touches the soundboard This means that the vibrations are sent to the soundboard The soundboard is a very important part of the piano If it is damaged the piano will not make a good sound

The mechanism which makes the hammer bounce off the string very quickly is called the escapement In 1821 Sebastian Erard invented a kind of double escapement This made it possible to repeat the note very quickly The hammer only touches the string for about one thousandth of a second The hammers are covered with felt which is a mixture of wool silk and hair

The piano has two pedals Larger pianos have three

Once the piano became popular in the late 18th century many composers wrote music for the piano Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart started to learn on harpsichords when he was very small but the piano was becoming popular when he was a young man and he wrote many sonatas and concertos for the piano Franz Joseph Haydn also wrote a lot of piano music Ludwig van Beethoven was a very famous pianist before he became very famous as a composer His piano compositions include 5 concertos and 32 sonatas  In the Romantic period many composers wrote for the piano They include Franz Schubert Robert Schumann Johannes Brahms and Franz Liszt Later composers include Sergei Rakhmaninov Claude Debussy Maurice Ravel Sergei Prokofiev Dmitri Shostakovich and Bela Bartok

Some famous piano players from the early days of the piano include Dussek Mozart Clementi John Field and Chopin In the 19th century Franz Liszt was a very great influence on the piano by composing and performing very difficult music Other great pianists include Clara Schumann and Anton Rubinstein 20th century pianists include Artur Schnabel Vladimir Horowitz Josef Hofmann Wilhelm Kempff Dinu Lipati Claudio Arrau Artur Rubinstein Sviatoslav Richter Alfred Brendel Among the greatest pianists today are Vladimir Ashkenazy Daniel Barenboim Leif Ove Andsnes Boris Berezovsky and Evgeny Kissin

Pianists who play popular music include Liberace Jerry Lee Lewis Jimmy Swaggart Little Richard Elton John Billy Joel Thelonious Monk Tori Amos and Ray Charles Perhaps the greatest jazz pianist was Fats Waller

The piano has been a very popular instrument ever since the mid 18th century when it soon replaced the clavichord and the harpsichord By the early 19th century the sound that the piano made was big enough to fill large concert halls Smaller pianos were made for use in peoples homes At first these included square pianos and giraffe pianos later on the upright pianos became popular for home use Pianos are not often used in orchestras They may however be used for piano concertos There is a vast amount of music written for piano solo The piano can also be used together with other instruments in jazz groups and for accompanying singing

Music for the piano is normally written on two staves the upper stave is for the right hand the lower stave for the left hand Much of the time the right hand music is written in the treble clef the left hand music in the bass clef 

Pianists have to learn many things It is important to sit comfortably with a straight back so that hands can reach all the keys The hands should be shaped like a ball so that the fingers are curved They should be able to control the sound they make with the weight of the arm and fingers Lots of practice is needed to become a good pianist Some people can play the piano very well by ear but learning to read music helps a person to become a better pianist and musician Playing the piano helps people to understand harmony because the piano can play chords

Pianos need to be tuned regularly A piano tuner is a person whose job it is to tune pianos 

The Italian word piano is used in music to show that music should be played softly It is pronounced in the Italian way When we talk about the musical instrument we pronounce it the English way

Constitutionally the islands are part of the British crown but are not part of the United Kingdom Being part of the mediaeval duchy of Normandy allegiance is owed to the Queen but not to the Parliament of the United Kingdom which cannot pass laws for the Bailiwick of Guernsey and the Bailiwick of Jersey except for defence and diplomatic matters except if the bailiwicks ask it to In general the bailiwicks are self governing but they often pass laws which are like United Kingdom laws However some of their laws are still based on Norman law

Hedonism is a type of philosophy Hedonism can be generally summed up as a belief that pleasure is the highest good or that whatever causes pleasure is right 

In Hedonism people think that what makes them happy is good Things that avoid pain are also good Hedonism is focused around pleasure There are different beliefs in hedonism Some people believe it is important to get as many pleasurable experiences as possible others believe that the quality of the pleasure matters They think there are higher and lower pleasures Some well known Hedonists were John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham

Many people also believe Hedonism is related to sex This is not true Sex can be a very pleasurable experience but when philosophers talk about Hedonism they think more about the pleasure of reading a good book listening to classical music or discussing with other philosophers

Two types of Hedonism are Cyrenaicism and Epicureanism Cyrenaicism is where people make themselves happy in the fastest amount of time Epicureanism is where people like to be happy but they do so slowly so that they cause less pain to themselves They also look more into the future and go for the higher pleasures in life

The Shinkansen is a group of high speed railway lines in Japan upon which the famous Bullet Trains run

The Shinkansen are run by the many companies of Japan Railway In the past Japan Railway was called Japanese National Railways It is now one group of private companies

The name Bullet Train is the English translation of the Japanese word dangan ressha which was the name given to the project while it was being made in the 1940s Nowadays the trains are called Shinkansen trains The name Shinkansen means New Trunk Line The trains are called Super Expresses

Japan was the first country to build railway lines for high speed travel Because Japan has many mountains the network that already existed was made of 36 gauge narrow gauge lines which tended to take non direct routes and could not be adapted to higher speeds Because of this Japan had a greater need for new high speed lines than countries where the existing standard gauge or broad gauge rail system could be upgraded easily Unlike the older lines Shinkansen lines are standard gauge and use tunnels and viaducts to go through and over obstacles rather than around them

Construction of the first section of the Tokaido Shinkansen between Tokyo and Osaka started in 1959 The line opened on October 1 1964 just in time for the Tokyo Olympics The line was an immediate success reaching the 100 million passenger mark in less than three years on July 13 1967 and one billion passengers in 1976

The first Shinkansen trains ran at speeds of up to 200 kmh later increased to 220 kmh Some of these trains with their classic bullet nosed appearance are still in use for stopping services between Hakata and Osaka A driving car from one of the original trains is now in the British National Railway Museum in York 

Many more advanced models of train followed the first type generally each with its own distinctive appearance Shinkansen trains now run regularly at speeds of up to 300 kmh putting them among the fastest trains running in the world along with the French TGV and German ICE trains

Originally meant to carry passenger and freight trains by day and night the Shinkansen lines carry only passenger trains The system shuts down between midnight and 600 every day to allow maintenance to take place including the running of Doctor Yellow test trains The few overnight trains that still run in Japan run on the old narrow gauge network which the Shinkansen runs parallel to

In 2003 JR Tokai reported that the Shinkansens average arrival time was within 6 seconds of the scheduled time This includes all natural and human accidents and errors and is calculated from about 160000 trips Shinkansen made The previous record was from 1997 and was 18 seconds

The first derailment of a Shinkansen train in passenger service occurred during the Chuetsu Earthquake on October 23 2004 6 of the total of 8 cars of the train on the Joetsu Shinkansen derailed near Nagaoka Station in Nagaoka Niigata

In recent years due to noise pollution increasing speed is getting harder Thus the current research is aimed to reduce the amount of noise mainly when trains exit a tunnel

Three extensions are under construction for opening by 2014 2018 Nagano Kanazawa Aomori Hakodate and Takeo Onsen Isahaya

The Shinkansen goes up to 300kmh

Two further lines known as Mini Shinkansen have also been constructed by upgrading existing sections of line

Another standard gauge line using Shinkansen trains is not considered to be a Shinkansen line

The following lines are under development

Most Shinkansen lines that were proposed during the boom of the early 1970s have been postponed indefinitely These include a link to Shikoku by the Honshu Shikoku bridge system a link from Tokyo to New Tokyo International Airport and a route covering the entire Sea of Japan coast of Honshu

Copper is a chemical element It is the 29th element on the periodic table It has 29 protons Its mass number is 6355 It is a transition metal It is in the middle of the periodic table The symbol for copper is Cu which comes from the Latin word cuprum which in turn came from the Latin word for the island of Cyprus where copper was found 

It is a reddish coloured metal It is a pinkish color when it is new but turns a redish orange color after it is exposed to air It is very flexible and ductile That means that it can be stretched into wires easily It can be drawn into a wire thinner than a human hair Copper is also very soft it has a Mohs hardness of 25 to 3 That means that it is harder than a fingernail but softer than a steel pocketknife It is also one of the few colored metals Most metals are gray or silver Gold copper and osmium are the only three colored metals It conducts electricity and heat very well

It is more pink when pure and turns reddish when exposed to air The reddish color is a thin layer of corrosion on the copper Copper can also turn black when heated This is because of a coating of copper oxide It can also turn green This is because of a coating of copper carbonate and copper hydroxide In other words it turns green because it oxidises Copper corrodes in solutions having sulfides It reacts with solutions of hydrochloric acid or ammonia containing oxygen It can also dissolve in a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and hydrochloric acid This makes copper chloride It does not dissolve in plain acids It can dissolve in nitric acid to make copper nitrate and nitrogen dioxide or nitric oxide

It forms chemical compounds Copper in these compounds has two normal oxidation states 2 is most common Most 2 copper compounds are blue 1 copper compounds can be white Copper compounds are weak oxidizing agents They corrode many metals This corrosion takes the metal and puts it in the chemical compound leaving the copper behind An example would be iron and copper sulfate reacting to make copper and iron sulfate 1 copper compounds are reducing agents when in air They are normally made by reduction of 2 compounds

Copper compounds can be black green reddish white blue or yellow

 FileCopper sulfatejpgCopper sulfate a copper compound FileCopper chloride dihydratejpgCopper chloride a copper compound FileCopper chloride photojpgCopper chloride a copper compound It is white but air reacts with it easily to turn it green FileCopperIoxidejpgCopper oxide a copper compound FileCopperIIoxidejpgCopper oxide a copper compound 

Copper can be found as a metal in the ground Normally it is green on the outside Most copper is not as a metal but in chemical compounds Chalcopyrite is the most common copper ore It is a mixture of pyrite and copper sulfide Copper is found in small amounts in living things Some mollusks and arthropods have blue blood because they have copper in their blood Animals such as humans and other mammals have red blood because it contains iron

Copper is sometimes just taken out of the ground and shaped into objects But most copper is not in a metal form in the ground Chalcopyrite is the main copper ore It is heated with air to separate the iron as iron oxide Some copper oxide is made Sulfur dioxide is also made Then silicon dioxide is added which reacts with the iron oxide to make a liquid which is drained Now only copper and sulfide are left The copper sulfide reacts with air to make copper metal and sulfur dioxide Some copper sulfide reacts with the copper oxide to make copper and sulfur dioxide This makes impure copper

Copper is made pure by electrolyzing it A thin sheet of pure copper is put on the cathode and a thick sheet of impure copper is put on the anode The electrolyte is copper sulfate The impure copper gets dissolved in the solution It then coats the thin sheet of pure copper This makes the copper pure

Large amounts of copper are recycled because of its high value and the increasing depletion of worldwide copper reserves

Copper may be the oldest metal in use as very old copper tools have been found Copper is used in electrical wiring It can also be shaped into various parts It can be used in a heat sink The Statue of Liberty is made of copper It is also used in pipes carrying water because it does not corrode

When people mix copper with tin bronze is made Bronze is an important metal because it can be shaped into useful things but it was more important before the use of iron When zinc is mixed with copper brass is made It can be alloyed with nickel to make cupronickel

Copper is important in the human body If a person does not get enough copper the molecules in the body might not work Having too much copper though can be a problem Humans get most of the copper they need from food and vitamins also contain copper to make sure we get enough Copper compounds are also used to kill fungi and algae

Copper is not toxic as a metal Copper compounds are toxic though although small amounts are needed to live Copper is expelled from the body easily so it does not build up in toxic effects 

A prince is a male member of a royal family A female prince is known as princess

A princess is a female member of a royal family especially a daughter of a monarch A son of a monarch is called a prince In some cases a woman can become a princess by marrying a king A princess may also become a ruler by heredity or by marriage Sometimes the expression princess is used when a female has noble qualities such as kindness charity and virtue

An ore is a mineral which has a metal inside it Ores are usually extracted by being mined but can sometimes be found on the Earths surface The metal in ore is often valuable There are different ways to get the metal out of the ore

Plasma is a form of matter The three other common states of matter are solids liquids and gases so plasma is sometimes called the fourth state of matter Plasma is made by heating a gas until its atoms and molecules break up into negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions Unlike the other states of matter the charged particles in a plasma will react strongly to electric and magnetic fields If a plasma gets cold the ions will re form into a gas

Over 99 of the matter in the universe is believed to be plasma When the atoms in a gas are broken up the pieces are called electrons and ions Because these pieces have an electric charge they are pulled together or pushed apart by electric fields and magnetic fields This makes a plasma act different from a gas For example magnetic fields can be used to hold a plasma but not to hold a gas Plasma is a better conductor of electricity than copper

Plasma is usually very very hot because it takes very high temperatures to break the bonds between electrons and the nuclei of the atoms Sometimes plasmas can have very high pressure like in stars Stars are mostly made of plasma Plasmas can also have very low pressure like in outer space

On earth lightning and aurora make plasma Artificial uses of plasma include fluorescent lightbulbs neon signs and plasma displays used for television or computer screens Scientists are experimenting with plasma to make a new kind of nuclear power called fusion which would be much better and safer than ordinary nuclear power and would produce much less radioactive waste

At first Mussolini was a socialist but when he wanted Italy to join the First World War he was thrown out of the socialist party He invented a new ideology Fascism much out of Nationalistand Socialist views Fascism is a system where one leader has complete power over a nation with a goal of making it completely independent of other nations and also where the goals of the nation being more important than anything else including citizens Therefore it is called a totalitarian ideology

In 1922 he took power by having a large group of men Black Shirts march on Rome and threaten to take over the government King Vittorio Emanuele III gave in allowed him to form a government and made him prime minister In the following five years he gained power and in 1927 created the OVRA his personal secret police force Using the agency to arrest scare or murder people against his regime Mussolini was dictatorof Italy by the end of 1927 Only the King and his own Fascist party could challenge his power



Mussolinis form of Fascism Italian Fascism unlike Nazism the racist ideology that Adolf Hitler followed was different and less destructive than Hitlers Although a believer in the superiority of the Italian nation and national unity Mussolini unlike Hitler is quoted Race It is a feeling not a reality Nothing will ever make me believe that biologically pure races can be shown to exist today

Mussolini wanted Italy to become a new Roman Empire In 1923 he attacked the island of Corfu and in 1924 he occupied the city state of Fiume In 1935 he attacked the African country Abyssinia His forces occupied it in 1936 Italy was thrown out of the League of Nations because of this aggression In 1939 he occupied the country Albania In 1936 Mussolini signed an alliance with Adolf Hitler the dictator of Germany

In 1940 he sent Italy into the Second World War on the side of the Axis countries Mussolini attacked Greece but he failed to conquer it In 1943 the Allies landed in Southern Italy The Fascist party and King Vittorio Emanuel III deposed Mussolini and put him in jail but he was set free by the Germans who made him ruler of the Italian Social Republic puppet state When the war was almost over Mussolini tried to escape to Switzerland with his mistress Clara Petacci but he was captured and shot by partisans Mussolinis dead body was hanged upside down together with some of Mussolinis helpers on a pole at a gas station in the village of Mezzegra which is near the border between Italy and Switzerland

Examples of puppet states before World War II are

In World War II the Axis countries created some puppet states like

After Italy surrendered in World War II the Italian Social Republic was a puppet state created by Germany

During the Cold War some Eastern European countries were puppet states of the Soviet Union

In some of these countries the people overthrew the government but each time they did that the Soviet Union and some of its other puppet states invaded and put the old government back in power The Soviet Union had also some puppet states outside Europe such as Mongolia

The United States also had a some puppet states during the Cold War

There are several countries that may be called puppet states now

Some people call Israel a puppet of the United States

Banana republic is a pejorative name for a country which has an unstable government high corruption and which largely depends on agriculture such as growing bananas There are many coups in banana republics Some countries in Central and South America are often called banana republics

The original Banana republic is Honduras In the early 20th century the United Fruit Company had very much influence in the country They even deposed a president and installed a new one because the old president wanted too high taxes 

The first known use of the term banana republic was by American author O Henry in his 1904 book of linked short stories Cabbages and Kings The book is based on Henrys 1896 97 stay in Honduras while hiding from federal authorities for embezzlement in the United States OHenry used the term to refer to a servile dictatorship which directly supported large scale plantation agriculture in return for payments or gifts Usually the agriculture was to grow bananas 

Some people say the coup against Jacobo Arbenz president of Guatemala in 1954 was because Arbenz took land from banana companiesfactdateJuly 2010

It is a Germanic language It comes from the Old Norse language the language spoken by the Vikings Because Iceland is far away from other countries the language has not changed much Icelandic people can still read words from hundreds of years ago

Icelandic uses four characters that are not used in English  and It can also be said that is a softer version of

The equator is a line which is not real drawn around a sphere or planet such as the Earth It is one of the lines known as a line of latitude or circle of latitude The name equator is Latin language and means even maker at equator the day and night are exactly the same length around the year

The equator is halfway between the North Pole and the South Pole There the surface of the planet is parallel to the axis of rotation The equator divides the surface into the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere

Unlike the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere countries around the equator do not experience the four seasons and the climate is usually very humid

A rocket may be a missile spacecraft aircraft or other vehicle which is pushed by a rocket engine Some rockets are manned Other rockets are unmanned Most rockets can be launched from the ground because exhaust thrust from the engine is bigger than the weight of the vehicle in relation to its weight on earth 

The rocket was invented by the Chinese while using gunpowder

Rockets are used for fireworks weapons for placing man made satellites and to control moves in outer space

Manned rockets like other manned flying machines are designed to limit their acceleration and vibration to protect the crew

Unmanned rockets however are not bound by the limits of humans Rockets go faster than the speed of sound and may reach speeds of up to Mach 5 and even up to 30000 kmhr when in Orbit

Moresnet or Neutral Moresnet was a very small territory that existed from 1816 to 1919 It had a size of 35 km It existed because its neighbours could not agree on who should own it so they decided to make it a neutral territory where both neighbours would both have power It was 7 km Southwest of Aix la Chapelle and south of the points were the borders of Germany Belgium and the Netherlands come together on the Vaalserberg

At the Congress of Vienna in 1815 many borders and countries changed One of the borders was the one between the new United Kingdom of the Netherlands and Prussia For the most part Prussia and the Netherlands agreed on the border because it was mostly the same as the old border Around Moresnet there was a problem Between the villages of Moresnet and Neu Moresnet was the zinc mine of Vieille Montagne Altenberg Both countries wanted to have this mine In 1816 it was decided that the village of Moresnet itself would become part of the Netherlands Neu Moresnet would become part of Prussia and the mine and the village of Kelmis around it would become neutral territory where both countries shared the power

Neutral Moresnet was shaped more or less like a triangle The southern border was the road between Aix la Chapelle and Lige The mine was just to the north of this road The most northerly point of the country was the Vaalserberg When Belgium became independent from the Netherlands in 1830 the land on the Dutch side became Belgian So from 1830 Belgium and Prussia were in power in Moresnet At first Moresnet was governed by two royal commissioners one from each neighbour Later Moresnet got its own rulers a mayor and a council of ten members were installed The mayor was the Head of State he was appointed by the council

Most people in Moresnet worked in the zinc mine Many people from the neighbouring countries also worked in the zinc mine Because Moresnet was neutral there were very low taxes and there were no import tariffs The people from Moresnet were allowed to choose in which army they wanted to serve but they were not allowed to have their own army

The mine was exhausted by 1885 so people from Moresnet had to find a new way to find money Some wanted to start a casino or issue their own stamps Dr Wilhelm Molly wanted to change Moresnet into a country were everyone would speak Esperanto He wanted to name the country Amikejo None of these plans succeeded Belgium and Prussia both wanted to take over the territory In 1914 in the First World War Germany invaded Belgium and occupied Moresnet In 1915 the officially annexed it so Neutral Moresnet did not exist any more

In 1919 after the war in the Treaty of Versailles it was decided that Moresnet would become part of Belgium From 1940 to 1944 during World War II Moresnet was occupied by Germany again but since 1944 it has been part of Belgium again

Atoms are made of neutrons protons and electrons It was once thought neutrons protons and electrons were fundamental particles Fundamental particles can not be broken up into anything smaller After the invention of the particle accelerator this was found to not be true Although electrons are fundamental neutrons and protons are not Neutrons and protons are made up of smaller particles called quarks and held together by gluons

There are six types of quarks The types are called flavours The flavours are up down strange charm top and bottom Up charm and top quarks have a charge of frac23 while down strange and bottom quarks have a charge of frac13 Each quark has a matching antiquark Antiquarks have a charge opposite to that of their quarks meaning that up charm and top antiquarks have a charge of frac23 and that down strange and bottom antiquarks have a charge of frac13

Only up and down quarks are found inside atoms of the normal matter Two up quarks and one down make a proton while two down quarks and one up make a neutron The other four flavours are not seen naturally on Earth but they can be made in particle accelerators Some of them may also exist inside of stars

When two or more quarks are held together by the strong nuclear force the particle formed is called a hadron Quarks that make the quantum number of hadrons are named valence quarks The two families of hadrons are baryons and mesons

When quarks are stretched farther and farther the force that holds them together becomes bigger When it comes to the point when quarks are separated they form two sets of quarks

The idea for quarks was proposed by physicists Murray Gell Mann and George Zweig in 1964 Other scientists began searching for evidence of quarks and succeeded in 1968

The superparticle of a quark is called a squark

Messiah or the Anointed One is the figure promised by God to the Jews for the salvation of the world The Jews think that the Messiah will be a human being that will save Israel and lead the whole world into the End Of Days and eternal peace 

Other people in real life or fiction are called messianic if they have the qualities of a messiah or people think they will bring about a better world

Christianity which began in Israel with Jewish followers of Jesus holds that the Messiah foretold by the Jewish Scriptures is Jesus and that in fulfillment of prophecy Jesus died for the sins of the world rose from the dead and lives today seated at the right hand of God until His return Most Jews do not hold these beliefs those who do are sometimes called Messianic Jews Some Messianic Jews and other Christians see the fact that a majority of Jews do not hold these beliefs as a fulfillment of prophecy factdateJuly 2010

Muslims believe that Jesus was the son of Mary the Messiah and as a mighty prophet of God They believe that he will come again one day in his second coming to fight besides the Mahdi against the

Csar Estrada Chvez was the leader of a labor union He wanted equal rights for Mexicans working in the United States Chvez started the National Farm Workers Association This union became the United Farm Workers He led a boycott against grape companies to gain rights for workers Chvez used nonviolence to make these changes Chavez is thought of as one of the leaders in the movement for Chicanos to gain more rights in the late 20th century

In 1965 Chvez and the NFWA started a strike for grape pickers in California At the same time he asked Americans to boycott grapes from California In 1970 the migrant workers won their fight for better pay

He kept working against unfair labor rules He stopped eating in protest three times because of low pay and bad working conditions When he died he was leading another grape boycott to stop the use of pesticides

Chvez was born near Yuma Arizona and went to over 65 schoolscn but he did not graduate He did most of his organizing in California especially near Bakersfield Fred Ross taught him to lead unions Fred Ross was a student of Saul Alinsky

Chvez is respected in California and other states In 2000 Californias state legislature started a holiday to honor him The holiday is on March 31 Chvezs birthday This is the first time that a US public holiday honored a Mexican American or a union leader Many cities have streets named for him These cities include San Francisco Los Angeles Albuquerque New Mexico Austin Texas Milwaukee and Salt Lake City

A shape is a geometric figure that can be described with mathematics One way to classify shapes is to describe a bigger shape that the shape fits inside of For example two dimensional shapes like circles will fit inside of a flat plane Three dimensional objects like cubes will not fit inside of a plane because they are not flat

Two shapes are said to be equal if one can be changed into the other by spinning moving growing bigger shrinking or more than one of these in a combination

These are two dimensional shapes or flat plane geometry shapes Their sides are made of straight or curved lines They can have any number of sides Plane figures made of lines are called polygons Triangles and squares are examples of polygons

A pen is a tool used for writing or drawing The ink of the pen is pressed onto paper and dries very fast

Quill pens are one of the oldest type of pens A quill pen is the feather of a bird usually a goose The end of the feather was kept very sharp and had to be dipped into ink after every few words

Dip pens are an old type of pen Like the quill pen they have to be dipped in ink many times during writing or drawing The writing end called the nib is made of metal

Fountain pens are like dip pens but can hold enough ink inside to write several pages before being refilled 

A ballpoint pen is GENERALLY a cylindrical plastic shaft with a smaller shaft that holds ink It has a very small metal ball on the writing end that rolls the ink onto the paper

A stylus is a pen that cannot write on paper and is usually made out of plastic They are usually used with touchscreens

Leet also known as eleet or leetspeak is another alphabet for the English language that is used mostly on the internet It uses various combinations of ASCII characters to replace Latinate letters For example leet spellings of the word leet include 1337 and l33t eleet may be spelled 31337 or 3l33t It is used a lot on the internet in forums chat rooms and online games

It comes from the word elite which means better than everyone else Leet is mostly used for English but can also be used with other languages including French Spanish and German

Leetspeak is a mixture of words spelled incorrectly intentionally usually coming from typographical errors The words of leetspeak are usually put together to create a dialect This dialect is used in some places for funniness l33tspeak uses numbers ASCII symbols and diacritics together to make symbols that look like Latin letters For example in the name David would translate in 1337534 as 1

Note Most of the time it is only the vowels that are changed and then usually only they are replaced by numbers therefore it is unusual to see someone use the leet alphabet to spell out a whole word Please note as these are only examples these are not mandatory for leetspeak which is not officially defined anywhere like most slangs

When people write in leet they spell some words wrong all the time They might do this to laugh at new people who do not write words with their keyboards well or might just be making fun of Englishs pronunciation or spelling

When a person writes in English the person must follow English rules but most of the time people who write in leet do not use these rules When they write in leet they try to write it in a special way so that it is very different from English

l33t is teh suck shows that in leet people can use their own rules and not use the English rules A lot of times adjectives are turned into nouns The leet word teh is also often placed in front of verbs as in I teh pwnd j00 another example might be I 4m t3h pwnage1111

Because some words are too long for use in games they have been written how they sound Heres a quick guide

A waterfall is where there is a sharp fall of water found on a river or stream The water flows from higher land then it falls down a big step of rock to lower land where it will continue on its journey Waterfalls are usually made when a river is young

Gardening can be done outside of the home as well There are in city gardens botanical gardens zoos which have gardens and theme parks which have gardens These types of gardens are cared for by people called gardeners or groundskeepers

Gardens are related to farms both gardens and farms are used for growing plants But farms are much larger than gardens A farm may have hundreds of square kilometers of plants and crops A garden in a persons backyard is usually only measures a few square meters 

Farms are businesses which sell the crops fruit and vegetables that are produced Some gardens are businesses which charge a fee to enter the garden However private gardens in peoples backyards are used as a hobby or as a recreation not as a business

In addition to plants many gardens also have landscaping features such as pathways seats rock gardens ponds fountains a small stream with or without a waterfall Some incorporate gazebos and structural designs to accommodate for places to sit or to place a hammock for a siesta Roman gardens will have its own columns fountains and statures placed at strategic places depending on its sizes and uses Japanese gardens also have its own unique designs based on what the owner want to feature

Many people find gardens relaxing especially if the garden is full flowers with strong scents Some flowers like roses bougainvilleas orchids and many others are just beautiful to look at Many people think that gardens are very beautiful and a place to relax and or entertain A garden can have a place to barbecue to sit and to read

In many countries and cultures designing pretty gardens is considered to be an art In Japan for instance Zen monks build decorative gardens with stone and waterfall features using natural materials such as bamboo rock and BONSAI trees like spruce pine and other trees with they trained into miniature forms In Europe in the 1700s kings and queens had formal gardens built In China they also feature Chinese forms of gardens Now some enterprising people start to have herbal gardens to feature useful herbs used in alternative traditional and homeopathic medicine

Great Zimbabwe is an important place in Africa Hundreds of years ago it was a big city It was the capital of the Kingdom of Zimbabwe This kingdom included the River Zambezi in the north the Transvaal in the south and Botswana in the east

The people who lived at Great Zimbabwe were rich merchants who controlled trade between the coast and inland Africa The modern country of Zimbabwe is named after Great Zimbabwe In English the citys name means the great city built of stones

Between 12000 and 20000 people lived at Great Zimbabwe About 1000 years ago they began to build their town in stone Archaeologists have found goods from as far as China that were used by the people This shows they bought and sold things over great distances The city covered 720 hectares but had stopped growing when traders from Portugal came to southern Africa 500 years ago Nobody is sure why Great Zimbabwe was stopped It could have been due to drought or sickness

Europeans at first thought that Great Zimbabwe had been built by foreigners Now we know it was built by the local people People who have studied the site have learned much about old Africa

Great Zimbabwe has been made a World Heritage Site because it is so big and important The walls of the city are the biggest stone structure made by man after the Pyramids at Giza

Machu Picchu is a is a pre Columbian 15th century Inca site in Peru in South America by which lies an ancient Inca city whose name is unknown

The Inca built the city on a mountain ridge 2340m above sea level They lived there between 1200 and 1450 AD Other people lived there before around 650 AD 

The Incas built houses fields and temples by cutting the rock on the mountain so it was flat They built an observatory to look at the stars

When the Spanish invaded Peru the Incas left Machu Picchu Nobody knows why they did that but some think it was because they were scared of the Spanish The city was left unfinished most likely due to the civil war between the rival Inca brothers who ruled named Huascar and Atahualpa and due to the Spanish invasion The Spanish never found Machu Picchu or the lost city during their occupation

Today Machu Picchu is very difficult to get to because it is so high in the mountains It has only one way in and a stone wall to protect it The world at large did not know it was there until a Yale graduate named Hiram Bingham rediscovered it in 1911 He heard rumors of a hidden city which was already known to the native Peruvians who guided him there He led a restoration project partly funded by the National Geographic Society Bingham made a deal with the government to take artifacts to the Peabody Museum for study Peru is still trying to have those artifacts returned to them

Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historical Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 In 2007 Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide Internet poll

Since formation of the Apple Computer Company in 1977 Apple has employed over 75000 people worldwide The majority of Apples employees have been located in the United States but Apple has substantial manufacturing sales marketing and support organizations worldwide with some engineering operations in Paris and Tokyo

Apple employees include employees of companies Apple owns and less important but still relevant companies such as FileMaker Inc and Braeburn Capital

Apple Corps has repeatedly sued Apple Inc for trademark infringement In the first case Apple Inc agreed not to go into the music industry Apple Corps believes this agreement was broken when Apple Inc launched iTunes the music store

Soil is the combination of rock mineral fragments made by weathering and organic matter water and air It is mostly made up of grains of weathered rock and varying amounts of humus The type of soil depends on the mix of humus and on the size of the grains of the rock The grains can be very small and smooth such as clay or they can be larger like grains of sand or even a piece of gravel Soils are important to our ecosystem for six main reasons first soils are a place for plants to grow second soils control the speed and the purity of water that moves through them third soils recycle nutrients from dead animals and plants fourth soils change the air that surrounds the earth called the atmosphere fifth soils are a place to live for animals insects and very small living things called microorganisms sixth soils are the oldest and the most used building materials The climate is very important when soil is made Soil from different climates can have very different qualities

The word organic is used for different things

Organic chemistry is based on carbon which is the basis for all living things

Organic matter in soil is material that is or once was a plant or animal

Organic adjective of or relating to an organism

Organic farming  agriculture conducted according to certain standards especially the use of only naturally produced fertilizers and non chemical means of pest control

3D means three dimensional or having three dimensions For example a box is three dimensional it is solid and not thin like a piece of paper It has volume a top and bottom left and right as well as a front and back You can turn the box around to view it from another side

A dimension is measurable in inches centimeters miles kilometers or any other unit of length

The three dimensions are called length width and height

3D graphics are used to make video games or animated movies A lot of calculations are needed to make pictures seem three dimensional on a screen

In mathematics length width and height are given letters to make them easier to write or if a value is not known X is width Y is height and Z is length Another common 3D coordinate system is the spherical coordinate system

The mathematical study of shapes and dimensions is called geometry Geometry can be used to measure how tall a mountain is

Some people see time as a fourth dimension It is also measured It is measured in units of time such as seconds hours years or any other measurement of time

Humidity refers to water vapor in the air but not to liquid droplets in fog clouds or rain Deserts usually have low humidity and tropical regions have high humidity

The word humid often means that the humidity is high feeling very damp stuffy or even sweltering when the temperature is also high When the humidity is low the air can be said to be not humid

The term relative humidity is used to note the amount of humidity as a percent from 0 100 Meteorologists have special devices to measure the humidity such as hygrometers

Humidity affects the rate of evaporation With a higher humidity the rate of evaporation is increased

A Calabi Yau space is a mathematical construction used by physicists to describe parts of nature that are too small to see with the human eye 

Most people know that there are three space directions and one time direction in the universe these directions are called dimensions Physicists use Calabi Yau spaces in studying high energy physics of which string theory is a part to add 6 or 7 or other numbers to build up more dimensions to the universe

The study of Calabi Yau spaces is part of a mathematical theory known as manifold theory

What we know by observation of very small distances where Calabi Yau takes place is pieced together by scientists 

We believe that matter is composed of atoms and the distances of the pieces of the atoms exist at 1015 meters That is 0000000000000001 meters The height of a human being 8 to 12 years old is near 1 meter A meter for our purposes we will also just say just about a yard here a half a meter is 05 meters And a tenth of a meter is 01 meters this is about the size we all are about 3 months before we are born about 3 to 4 inches Now we move down to the size of a human hair Starting at the size of a human hair and smaller this is where we observe the tiny parts of our world We cannot actually see them except for rare experiments like what Bill Phillips did by making a lot of them stop moving

But wait These tiny parts are also interesting Why Although they are small they are also very high in energy It is like they are compressed like a spring or like a very long rubber band wrapped around a golf ball

Now it might seem logical to think that that the smaller we go the less tight that is less energy 

But scientists find that the smaller we go the more energy the tiny particles contain 

So now recall the size of the human hair Scientists believe that is the size where these small but high energies begin to wrap themselves together much like the rubber band around the golf ball we talked about

An experiment is going on in Geneva Switzerland by a group called CERN One of CERNs experiments will move groups of these particles extremely fast and let them smash together Then they will watch the pieces of them as they fly apart

When we collect pictures of the smash we study them to see what happened This process takes place in the worlds largest atom smasher or as it is referred to today a collider and this one is called the LHC 

The experiments are exciting because scientists hope to find something never produced in experiments before called the Higgs particle and some people think that little black holes may be made inside the LHC

But it is also believed we stand a chance at finding pieces of atoms and pieces called particles unwrapping into Calabi Yau manifolds or perhaps they will take other forms Imagine if the golf ball were unwound really fast The long rubber band would wobble and spin as it unraveled This is exactly what it looks like when we look at the atomic particles in our collectors httpcdswebcernchrecord39451

Now this distance of 0000000000000001 meters or 1100000000000000 of a meter is in wide consideration in physics For example the legendary physicist John Wheeler can be seen working on maths with this distance where Calabi Yau takes place here

For the scales are tremendous and could be said to almost defy human perception How small this is can be presented in this example If we take a person to be on the average 1 and a half to 2 and a half meters tall we consider the Calabi Yau distances to be about 2 million million million times smaller than a human

And for the hyper example where the universe as we know it completely breaks up into pure quantumwe need to go another 18 orders of magnitude smaller What is this number It is another TWENTY decimal places even smaller than the Calabi Yau distance thresholds 

Calabi Yau is theorized as beginning to occur at perhaps 11000000000000000 of a meter as discussed above 

and

Quantum takes place completely at 

1100000000000000000000 meters distance BEYOND the atomic and Calabi Yau scales of 

11000000000000000 meters

That IS small

Now let us consider what space may look like at these Calabi Yau distances The model we learn at school for the most part is that it is all straight and 3 1 dimensionalWhat we have studied about molecules for example fits 3 1 extremely well Yet the data we often get in high energy experiments in colliders seem to suggest that under the presence of high energies space and time are bent around each other 

Now in order to get a better handle on manifolds of which Calabi Yau are an important set to high energy physics let us begin with a Moebius strip Here is a formal presentation of the Moebius strip httpenwikipediaorgwikiMC3B6biusstrip  as well as a very practical one here which is fun to do in classes introducing maths and physics httpmathforumorgsum95mathandmoebiusmoebiushtml  

A Moebius strip has a half a dimension Consider the paradox in our 3 space dimensions with one time dimension Space as we recognize it here in our everyday life has three dimensions time has one dimension but there are no half dimensions 

But what happens if Moebius strip is cut right down the middle with a pair of scissors The strip will form into one piece Here in the world of half dimensions or boundaries we find that when we cut something apparently in half we come up with one 

This set of paradoxical behaviour was not unobserved by the great Dutch artist of the 20th century Mauritz Cornelius Escher httpwwwworldofeschercomstorejpgsP17Ljpg   who portrayed in mastery and detail the shape of surfaces with the dimensions or boundaries cut missing overlapping and so forth in the most interesting unexpected and entertaining ways 

Now when we consider great energies and small distances it is not difficult to imagine how we find that things really curve up onto each other Escher himself imagined this perhaps in the picture httpwwwfacadecomcelebrityphotoMCEscherjpg  

Do we find curvatures such as this in nature Absolutely For example we notice that a magnetic field looks like so many circles when we place iron shavings on a piece of paper around a magnet httpwwwgutenbergorgfiles1659316593 himagesimage224jpg   And as if that were not enough we notice the same effect with respect to electricity httpwwwgutenbergorgfiles1659316593 himagesimage227jpg 

And we also note that planets and planetary objects such as the Moon rotate about each other Of course this is called the effect or force of gravity

So we could say that the distance of 1015 meters that is 0000000000000001 meters is extremely important because it is the distance where the forces of nature in our classical or everyday world become less effective This is the Calabi Yau area or distance At the same time more of the world at the small level perhaps the level of say dust becomes much more important The number of dimensions at Calabi Yau is a subject of great interest to high energy physics It could be called the nexus of high energy physics and classical physics For example at the cutting edge of the work where complex mathematics such as branes and supersymmetry emerge one can read the papers of theoretical physicists such as Ed Witten and others at this excellent reference sitehttpinstiphysicssunysbeduITPconfsimonswork3talkshtml

 

To learn Quantum mechanics is to learn about matter and energy The main things to learn are subatomic particles and electromagnetic waves Quantum mechanics explains how these things behave with each other The ideas of quantum mechanics are very difficult to understand Hard mathematics is used to study subatomic particles and electromagnetic waves because they act in very strange ways Quantum mechanics is important to physics and chemistry

Quantum is a Latin word that means how much So a quantum of energy is a specific amount of energy Light emitters such as candles or lasers shoot out light in units called photons Photons are particles much smaller than the smallest speck of dust The more photons that a lamp shoots off every second the brighter or more intense the light Light is a form of energy that behaves like waves in solids liquids or gasses Waves have wavelengths and photons have wavelike characteristics that are similar to those of the waves we know from everyday experience The distance between the top of one wave and the top of the wave nearest it is called a wavelength and photons have wavelengths that can be measured A lights color depends on what its wavelength is The color violet has a wavelength of about 400 nm Photons with wavelengths of 10 400 nm are called ultraviolet light Such light cannot be seen by the human eye On the other end of the spectrum red light is about 700 nm Infrared light is about 700 nm to 300000 nm Human eyes are not sensitive to infrared light either Wavelengths arent always so small Some longer wavelength photons are used for radio signals The wavelengths for your FM radio can be several meters in length Each photon has a definite amount of energy related to its wavelength The shorter the wavelength of a photon the greater is its energy For example an ultraviolet photon has more energy than an infrared photon 

Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional This means a longer wavelength will have a lower frequency and vice versa If the color of the light is infrared each photon can heat up what it hits So if a strong infrared lamp is pointed at a person that person will feel warm or even hot The surface of the infrared lamp may get hot enough to burn someone who may touch it However the person cannot get a sunburn from the photons emitted by the lamp because those photons do not have enough energy to kill living cells Humans cannot see infrared light but we can feel the radiation in the form of heat For example a person walking by a brick building that has been heated by the sun will feel heat from the building without having to touch it 

If the color of the light is ultraviolet then each photon has a lot of energy enough to hurt skin cells and cause a sunburn In fact most forms of sunburn arent caused by heat theyre caused by the high energy of the suns UV rays damaging your skin cells Even higher frequencies of light can penetrate deeper into the body and cause even more damage X rays have so much energy that they can go deep into the human body and kill cells Humans cannot see or feel ultraviolet light or x rays They may only know they have been under such high frequency light when they get a radiation burn Areas where it is important to kill germs often use ultraviolet lamps to destroy bacteria fungi etc X rays are sometimes used to kill cancer cells

Quantum mechanics started when it was discovered that a certain frequency means a certain amount of energy The higher the frequency the more energy a photon has and the more damage it can do Quantum mechanics later grew to explain the internal structure of atoms Quantum mechanics also explains the way that a photon can interfere with itself and many other things never imagined in classical physics

Planck discovered the relationship between frequency and energy Nobody before had ever guessed that frequency would be directly proportional to energy If we choose to use what are called natural units then the number representing the frequency of a photon would also represent its energy The equation would then be

meaning energy equals frequency

But the way physics grew there was no natural connection between the units then used to measure energy and the units commonly used to measure time So the formula that Planck worked out to make the numbers all come out right was

or energy equals h times frequency This h is a number called Plancks constant after its discoverer 

Quantum mechanics is based on the knowledge that a photon of a certain frequency means a photon of a certain amount of energy Besides that relationship a specific kind of atom can only give off certain frequencies of radiation so it can also only give off photons that have certain amounts of energy

Isaac Newton thought that light was made of very small things that we would now call particles Christiaan Huygens thought that light was made of waves Scientists thought that a thing cannot be a particle and a wave at the same time Scientists did experiments to find out whether light was made of particles or waves They found out that both ideas were right light was somehow both waves and particles The Double slit experiment performed by Thomas Young showed that light must act like a wave The Photoelectric effect proved that light had to act like particles that carried specific amounts of energy and that the energies were linked to their frequencies This experimental result is called the wave particle duality in quantum mechanics Later physicists found out that everything behaves both like a wave and like a particle not just light Here are some of the people who discovered the basic parts of quantum mechanics Max Planck Albert Einstein Satyendra Nath Bose Niels Bohr Louis de Broglie Max Born Paul Dirac Werner Heisenberg Wolfgang Pauli Erwin Schrdinger John von Neumann and Richard Feynman They did their work in the first half of the 20th century

Visible light given off by glowing hydrogen

Quantum Mechanics formulas and ideas were made to explain the light that comes from glowing hydrogen The quantum theory of the atom also had to explain why the electron stays in its orbit which other ideas were not able to explain It followed from the older ideas that the electron would have to fall in to the center of the atom because it starts out being kept in orbit by its own energy but it would quickly lose its energy as it revolves in its orbit

Hydrogen lamps work like neon lights but neon lights have their own unique group of colors of light Scientists learned that they could identify all elements by the light colors they produce They just could not figure out how the frequencies were determined

Putting in different numbers for m and n it is easy to predict frequencies for many types of light To see how this works go to Hyperphysics and go down past the middle of the page

In 1908 Walter Ritz made the Ritz combination principle that shows how certain gaps between frequencies keep repeating themselves This turned out to be important to Werner Heisenberg several years later

In 1905 Albert Einstein used Plancks idea to show that a beam of light is made up of a stream of particles called photons The energy of each photon depends on its frequency Einsteins idea is the beginning of the idea in quantum mechanics that all subatomic particles like electrons protons neutrons and others are both waves and particles at the same time This led to a theory about subatomic particles and electromagnetic waves called wave particle duality This is where particles and waves were neither one nor the other but had certain properties of both

In 1913 Niels Bohr had a new idea Maybe electrons could only take up certain orbits around the nucleus of an atom The numbers called m and n in the equation above could represent orbits An electron could begin in some orbit m and end up in some orbit n or an electron could begin in some orbit n and end up in some orbit m So if a photon hits an electron its energy will be absorbed and the electron will move to a higher orbit because of that extra energy And if an electron falls from a higher orbit to a lower orbit then it will have to give up energy in the form of a photon The energy of the photon will equal the energy difference between the two orbits and the energy of a photon makes it have a certain frequency and color Everything worked out very well that way but there was one big question left Each of the colors of light produced by glowing hydrogen has a brightness of its own and the brightness differences are always the same for each element Why

At this point most things about the light produced by a hydrogen lamp were known One big problem remained How can we explain the brightness of each of the lines produced by glowing hydrogen

Werner Heisenberg took on the job of explaining the brightness or intensity of each line He could not use any simple rule like the one Balmer had come up with He had to use the very difficult math of classical physics that figures everything out in terms of things like the mass of an electron the charge of an electron and other tiny quantities Classical physics already had answers for the brightness of the bands of color that a hydrogen lamp produces but the classical theory said that there should be a continuous rainbow and not four separate color bands Heisenbergs explanation is

There is some law that says what frequencies of light glowing hydrogen will produce It has to predict spaced out frequencies when the electrons involved are moving between orbits close to the nucleus of the atom but it also has to predict that the frequencies will get closer and closer together as we look at what the electron does in moving between orbits farther and farther out It will also predict that the intensity differences between frequencies get closer and closer together as we go out Where classical physics already gives the right answers by one set of equations the new physics has to give the same answers but by different equations 

Classical physics uses the methods of the French mathematician Fourier to make a math picture of the physical world and it uses collections of smooth curves that go together to make one smooth curve that gives in this case intensities for light of all frequencies form some light But it is not right because that smooth curve only appears at higher frequencies At lower frequencies there are always isolated points and nothing connects the dots So to make a map of the real world Heisenberg had to make a big change He had to do something to pick out only the numbers that would match what was seen in nature Sometimes people say he guessed these equations but he was not making blind guesses He found what he needed The numbers that he calculated would put dots on a graph but there would be no line drawn between the dots And making one graph just of dots for every set of calculations would have wasted lots of paper and not have gotten anything done Heisenberg found a way to efficiently predict the intensities for different frequencies and to organize that information in a helpful way

Just using the empirical rule given above the one that Balmer got started and Rydberg improved we can see how to get one set of numbers that would help Heisenberg get the kind of picture that he wanted

The rule says that when the electron moves from one orbit to another it either gains or loses energy depending on whether it is getting farther from the center or nearer to it So we can put these orbits or energy levels in as headings along the top and the side of a grid For historical reasons the lowest orbit is called n and the next orbit out is called n  a then comes n  b and so forth It is confusing that they used negative numbers when the electrons were actually gaining energy but that is just the way it is 

Since the Rydberg rule gives us frequencies we can use that rule to put in numbers depending on where the electron goes If the electron starts at n and ends up at n then it has not really gone anywhere so it did not gain energy and it did not lose energy So the frequency is 0 If the electron starts at n a and ends up at n then it has fallen from a higher orbit to a lower orbit If it does so then it loses energy and the energy it loses shows up as a photon The photon has a certain amount of energy e and that is related to a certain frequency f by the equation e h f So we know that a certain change of orbit is going to produce a certain frequency of light f If the electron starts at n and ends up at n  a that means it has gone from a lower orbit to a higher orbit That only happens when a photon of a certain frequency and energy comes in from the outside is absorbed by the electron and give it its energy and that is what makes the electron go out to a higher orbit So to keep everything making sense we write that frequency as a negative number There was a photon with a certain frequency and now it has been taken away

So we can make a grid like this where f means the frequency involved when an electron goes from energy state b to energy state a

Grid of f

Heisenberg did not make the grids like this He just did the math that would let him get the intensities he was looking for But to do that he had to multiply two amplitudes to work out the intensity He made an odd looking equation to handle this problem wrote out the rest of his paper handed it to his boss and went on vacation Dr Born looked at his funny equation and it seemed a little crazy He must have wondered Why did Heisenberg give me this strange thing Why does he have to do it this way Then he realized that he was looking at a blueprint for something he already knew very well He was used to calling the grid or table that we could write by doing for instance all the math for frequencies a matrix And Heisenbergs weird equation was a rule for multiplying two of them together Max Born was a very very good mathematician He knew that since when the two matrices being multiplied represented different things then when you multiply the first matrix by the second you get one answer and when you multiply the second matrix by the first matrix you get another answer Even though he did not know about matrix math Heisenberg already saw this different answers problem and it had bothered him But Dr Born was such a good mathematician that he saw that the difference between the first matrix multiplication and the second matrix multiplication was always going to involve Plancks constant h multiplied by the square root of negative one i So within a few days of Heisenbergs discovery they already had the basic math for what Heisenberg liked to call the indeterminacy principle By indeterminate Heisenberg meant that something like an electron is just not pinned down until it gets pinned down It is a little like a jellyfish that is always squishing around and cannot be in one place unless you kill it Later people got in the habit of calling it Heisenbergs uncertainty principle which made many people make the mistake of thinking that electrons and things like that are really somewhere but we are just uncertain about it in our own minds That idea is wrong It is not what Heisenberg was talking about Having trouble measuring something is a problem but it is not the problem Heisenberg was talking about

Heisenbergs idea is very hard to grasp but we can make it clearer with an example First we will start calling these grids matrices because we will soon need to talk about matrix multiplication

He did not know it but this equation gives a blueprint for writing out two matrices and for multiplying them The rules for multiplying one matrix by another are a little messy but here are the two matrices according to the blueprint and then their product

Matrix of p

Matrix of q

The matrix for the product of the above two matrices as specified by the relevant equation in Heisenbergs 1925 paper is

Where

Apqpqpq

Bpqpqpq

Cpqpqpq

and so forth

If the matrices were reversed the following values would result

Aqpqpqp

Bqpqpqp

Cqpqpqp

and so forth

Note how changing the order of multiplication changes the numbers step by step that are actually multiplied

The work of Werner Heisenberg seemed to break a log jam Very soon many different other ways of explaining things came from people such as Louis de Broglie Max Born Paul Dirac Wolfgang Pauli and Erwin Schrdinger The work of each of these physicists is its own story The math used by Heisenberg and earlier people is not very hard to understand but the equations quickly grew very complicated as physicists looked more deeply into the atomic world

In the early days of quantum mechanics Albert Einstein suggested that if it were right then quantum mechanics would mean that there would be spooky action at a distance It turned out that quantum mechanics was right and that what Einstein had used as a reason to reject quantum mechanics actually happened This kind of spooky connection between certain quantum events is now called quantum entanglement

In 1925 Werner Heisenberg described the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle which says that the more we know about where a particle is the less we can know about how fast it is going and in which direction in other words the more we know about the speed and direction of something small the less we can know about its position Physicists usually talk about the momentum in such discussions instead of talking about speed Momentum is just the speed of something in a certain direction times its mass 

The principle also says that there are many pairs of things for which we cannot know both of them about any particle no matter how hard we try The more we learn about one of such a pair the less we can know about the other

There is a special case which relates the knowledge of position and momentum and puts a limit on the product of those two values The ground state of the Quantum Simple Harmonic Oscillator is indeed in a minimum uncertainty state and behaves such that the inequality is an equality In other words thats when we can know the most about it because we got to the limit of how much the universe will let us know

Even Albert Einstein had trouble accepting such a bizarre concept and in a well known debate said God does not play dice To this Danish physicist Niels Bohr famously responded Einstein dont tell God what to do

Electrons surround every atoms nucleus Chemical bonds link atoms to form molecules A chemical bond links two atoms when electrons are shared between those atoms Thus QM is the physics of the chemical bond and of chemistry QM helps us understand how molecules are made and what their properties are

QM can also help us understand big things such as stars and even the whole universe QM is a very important part of the theory of how the universe began called the Big Bang

Everything made of matter is attracted to other matter because of a fundamental force called gravity The theory of gravity is called the theory of general relativity A problem in modern physics is that some conclusions of QM do not seem to agree with the theory of general relativity

QM is the part of physics that explains why all electronic technology works as it does Thus QM explains how computers work because computers are electronic machines But the designers of the early computer hardware of around 1950 or 1960 did not need to think about QM The designers of radios and televisions at that time did not think about QM either However the design of the more powerful integrated circuits and computer memory technologies of recent years does require QM

QM has also made possible technologies such as

Duisburg is a German city in the state of North Rhine Westphalia It is where the Rhine and the Ruhr rivers meet About 500000 people live in Duisburg

Kuopio is a Finnish city It is the biggest city and cultural center of Eastern Finland The population of Kuopio is 90000 and it is the 8th biggest city in Finland The city is very wide and has a lot of lakes inside it several parts of it are built on islands 

The traffic connections of the city are good with trains and aeroplanes There is a university of Kuopio too Kuopio is known as a strong center of welfare and health profession as the university is particularly oriented to those areas

In Finland the people of Kuopio have a special reputation they are known as happy and funny people

A hammer is a tool for putting nails into objects such as wood It has a long handle and a tip with a flat end for hitting nails The most common type of hammer has a curved end for pulling nails out

A sledgehammer is a hammer that has a longer shaft and a more massive head That way more force can be applied Sledgehammers are often used to

Hammers were sometimes used as weapons 

Feces is the bodys solid waste left over from eating food Feces leave the intestinal tract and are removed from the body through the anus Feces can be used to create fertilizers for plant crops Some feces are also used as a fuel for cookery Feces are known for their unpleasant odor and brown color Feces are used by some scientists to follow tiger populations

In informal language there are many words for feces These are often offensive or even vulgar Examples include poop crap and shit

Catholicism often means the Roman Catholic Church Sometimes it also refers to the Eastern Orthodox Churches or other Churches that believe in the great lists of Christian beliefs called creeds such as the Anglican Church The word catholic means everywhere or universal 

Both the religious denominations were made by Man not by Jesus Jesus came to abolish religion and have a personal relationship with Him The early Christian met at houses not churches The early churches a Jew who descended from the line of King David who was crucified by the Romans at the Jewish feast of Passover in accordance with and fulfillment of the Hebrew scriptures  especially Isaiah and the Psalms ca 33 AD The followers of Jesus reported in the scriptures as they witnessed it  that he was resurrected by God the Father and appeared to over 500 people for forty days before he ascended into heaven Its believed that he later sent the holy spirit onto his disciples at Pentecost when they spoke in tongues and understood each others different languages 

One of his followers Saint Peter was appointed leader by Jesus and later became recognized as the first Pope or Bishop of Rome soon after that  he was captured and died in Rome He was given the keys of the kingdom of heaven and was the first to recognize Jesus as Messiah when questioned by Jesus as to Who do you say that I am Today the pope is Benedict XVI who is the leader of the Church This is where the word pope comes from That is why the pope is also called the Holy Father  he is the Catholic spiritual father here on earth

In 325 the First Council of Nicaea agreed on how to organize the church The council agreed the Church had five patriarchs They were the archbishops of Rome Alexandria Antioch Constantinople and Jerusalem The Patriarch of Rome was honored as first among equals

In time the Church split apart with fights over who is right these fights caused breaks in the Church called schisms Most schisms happen because people have different beliefs about what is true but politics is often a big reason for these fights too

In 451 a church division happened when all the church leaders meeting at the Church Council in the city of Chalcedon excommunicated three leaders because they would not accept the view that Jesus had two natures These three were the bishops of Egypt Syria and Armenian Of course these three bishops did not accept being excommunicated either so the churches under them are still known today as Oriental Orthodox Churches

In 1054 the Great Church Orthodox and Catholic split into the Western Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church The Eastern Orthodox Church was divided into national churches making the Greek Orthodox Russian Orthodox Ukrainian Orthodox Serbian Orthodox Romanian Orthodox and so on The Roman Catholic Church developed the idea of one united church leader with the pope Some Eastern Orthodox Churches believe the emperor or king is the head of the Church as well as the countryFactdateApril 2009 In England the Anglican Church is like this

The next big schism was the Protestant Reformation which protested against the central authority of the Church in Rome and against what it thought were wrong ways of doing and believing things about God in the Catholic Church It started in Germany where Martin Luther sent his demands for change to the Church Because of politics in Europe many nations supported Luther The Lutheran Church was started Later the Calvinist or Presbyterian Church started

One of the most famous people in this period is King Henry VIII of England who started the Anglican church because he wanted to divorce his first wife and the Pope said he was not allowed to do that First his Church the Church of England was like the Catholic Church but with the king as leader instead of the pope Later under his son Edward VI and his daughter Elizabeth I the Anglican Church became more reformed or Protestant but Anglicans still believe they are reformed Catholics as well as Protestants

In the Reformation other Churches also split off from the Catholic Church and became Protestant Even inside Protestant churches disagreements over beliefs resulted in more splits This is why there are so many Protestant churches Some of these Protestant or Reformed churches are Lutheran Anglican Presbyterian Calvinist Methodist Baptist to name just a few Later on some people split again to make new kinds of churches which most Protestants do not believe are Christian at all like Mormons Jehovahs Witnesses Unitarian Universalist and many others

If a child refuses to obey hisher father the father punishes his child in church talk this is called excommunication In the Roman Catholic Church if believers disobey the pope they can also be punished or excommunicated There is only one way of belief for Catholics who want to be with the pope This is why Roman Catholics believe there is only one Catholic Church

A nail is a metal object with a flat head and a long sharp tip A hammer or nail gun is used to put it into another object It is often used to join two objects together

A dictatorship is a country where one person or political party has the power to do whatever he or she wants The ruler is called a dictator In a dictatorship people usually do not have many rights or much freedom 

A dictatorship that is ruled by soldiers is called a military dictatorship or junta An absolute monarchy can be considered to be a dictatorship but are usually not called dictators A dictatorship is usually not liked by the people because most dont like to be dictated around Most dictators are selfish and rule over the people just for power 

Some dictators have included

Electricity is a type of energy found in nature

Scientists have also found we can make electricity if we pass a magnet close to a metal wire or if we put the right chemicals in a jar with two different kinds of metal rod

Scientists have observed that electricity seems to flow like water from one place to another either as a spark or as a current in a metal They now know that all matter has electric charge but this is mostly cancelled out by the presence of matter with an opposite charge We only see an effect when there is too much or too little electric charge in one place so that it is not cancelled out

Since the nineteenth century electricity has been made into a useful creation that affects every part of our lives Until then it was just a curiosity or a force of nature seen in a thunderstorm

To be useful electricity has to be made from different sources of energy such as by burning coal or oil or from wind or the sunshine or flowing water in a power station

Electricity arrives at our homes through wires from the places where it is made It is used by Electric Lamps for producing light Electric Heaters to produce heat etc It is also used by many devices like washing machines Electric Cookers etc for doing work In factories electricity is used for running machines and computers 

The people who deal with electricity and electrical devices in our homes and factories are called Electricians

Electricity works because electric charges push and pull on each other There are two types of electric charge positive charge and negative charge Two positive charges repel each other This means that if you put two positive charges close together and let them go they would fly apart Two negative charges also repel But a negative charge and a positive charge attract each other This means that if you put a positive charge and a negative charge close together they would smack together A short way to remember this is the phrase opposites attract likes repel

Electric charges can push or pull on each other even though they are not touching This is possible because each charge makes an electric field around itself An electric field is an area that surrounds a charge At each point near a charge the electric field points in a certain direction If a positive charge is put at that point it will be pushed in that direction If a negative charge is put at that point it will be pushed in the exact opposite direction

All the matter in the world is made of tiny positive and negative charges The positive charges are called protons and the negative charges are called electrons Protons are much bigger and heavier than electrons but they both have the same amount of electric charge except that protons are positive and electrons are negative Because opposites attract protons and electrons stick together A few protons and electrons can form bigger particles called atoms and molecules Atoms and molecules are still very tiny It is impossible to see them without a very powerful microscope Any big object like your body has more atoms and molecules in it than anyone could count

Because negative electrons and positive protons stick together to make big objects all big objects that we can see and feel are electrically neutral Electrically is a word meaning describing electricity and neutral is a word meaning balanced That is why we do not feel objects pushing and pulling on us from a distance like they would if everything was electrically charged All big objects are electrically neutral because there is exactly the same amount of positive and negative charge in the world We could say that the world is exactly balanced or neutral This seems very surprising and lucky Scientists still do not know why this is so even though they have been studying electricity for a long time

In some materials electrons are stuck tightly in place while in other materials electrons can move all around the material Protons never move around a solid object because they are so heavy at least compared to the electrons A material that lets electrons move around is called a conductor A material that keeps each electron tightly in place is called an insulator Examples of conductors are copper aluminum silver and gold Examples of insulators are rubber plastic and wood Copper is used very often as a conductor because it is a very good conductor and there is so much of it in the world But sometimes other materials are used

Inside a conductor electrons bounce around but they do not keep going in one direction for long But if an electric field is set up inside the conductor the electrons will all start to move in the direction opposite to the direction the field is pointing A battery can make an electric field inside a conductor If both ends of a piece of wire are connected to the two ends of a battery the loop that was made is called a circuit Electrons will flow around and around the circuit as long as the battery is making an electric field inside the wire This flow of electrons around the circuit is called electric current

A conducting wire used to carry electric current is often wrapped in an insulator like rubber This is because wires that carry current are very dangerous If a person or an animal touched a bare wire carrying current they could get hurt or even die depending on how strong the current was You should be careful around electrical sockets and bare wires that might be carrying current

It is possible to connect an electrical device to a circuit so that electrical current will flow through a device This current will make the device do something that we want it to do Electrical devices can be very simple For example in a light bulb current flows through a special wire called a filament which makes it glow Electrical devices can also be very complicated Electricity can be used to drive a motor inside a tool like a drill or a pencil sharpener Electricity is also used to power modern electronic devices including telephones computers and televisions

Electricity is mostly generated in places called power stations Power stations use heat to turn water into steam The force of the steam pressure turns giant fan like structures called turbines which are linked to machines called generators Generators pass wires through strong magnetic fields to generate electricity 

Sometimes a natural flow such as wind or water can be used to directly turn a generator so no heat is needed

There are many sources of heat which can be used to generate electricity Heat sources can be classified into two types renewable energy resources in which the supply of heat energy never runs out and non renewable energy resources in which the supply will be eventually used up

Renewable energy resources

Non renewable energy resources These all use heat as a source of energy

Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon or Sailor Moon is a shojo manga by Naoko Takeuchi It was adapted to an anime series by Toei Animation CO LTD Sailor Moon was one the most popular animemanga series during the 1990s spanning five seasons four movies and multiple video games It continues to hold a strong fanbase with many fansites devoted to it

An anesthetic is a substance that doctors use on people It makes them either stop hurting or go completely to sleep during surgery Anesthetic can be given as rubbed onto the skin as an injection or as a gas to breathe Anaesthetic blocks the pain during operations This lets patients undergo surgery and other procedures without the distress and pain they would normally feel It comes from Greek roots an without and aesthetos perceptible able to feel

The modern anesthetic was created by Joseph Lister Before it people sometimes used cocaine alcohol and other drugs

Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz was the Prime Minister of Cuba from 1959 until 1976 when his title was changed to President of Cuba He temporarily gave power to his brother Ral Castro while recovering from surgery in summer of 2006 On February 19 2008 he announced that he would not return to power He was in power for 49 years

Fidel Castro has a doctorate of law from the University of Havana He was trained as a military lawyer He came to power after he and his guerrilla soldiers overthrew the dictatorship of General Fulgencio Batista

Castro is a communist and he made Cuba the first socialist country of the Americas During the Cold War he was a friend of the Soviet Union and he depended on their help until the USSR collapsed An important moment of the Cold War was the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 In 1961 the United States of America discovered that the Soviet Union was placing missiles on Cuba close to the United States After very tense talking a big nuclear war was avoided between the Soviet Union and the USA

Some people call Castro a dictator They criticize him because they think he has ignored some human rights for example torture murder and oppression of freedom of speech both at home and in African countries where he sent Cuban soldiers to spread Communism Other people do not think this is true For example Nelson Mandela has spoken in support of Castro and has thanked him for aid to Africa Amnesty International criticized Cubas human rights record but noted slow progress in July of 2002 Supporters of Castro say he gave Cuba the best health care and education of Latin America and created equality between the poor and the rich

Latin America is a region of the Americas People do not completely agree which countries are in Latin America but normally it is the parts where Spanish and Portuguese are spoken Sometimes the Caribbean Islands are also inclued Other people call all American countries where people speak Spanish Portuguese and French Latin America

The words Latin America come from the use of languages that came from Latin The Spanish Portuguese and French languages spoken by many people in Latin America are Romance languages Romance languages are derived from Latin Not all people in Latin America speak Romance languages some Latin American people speak Native American languages

Most Latin Americans are Roman Catholic

Washington DC is the capital city of the United States It is not a state The President of the United States and many major national government offices are located in the city 

Washington was named after the first US President George Washington The DC stands for District of Columbia a special area created that is not a state At first it was made up of a piece from Virginia south of the Potomac River and a piece from Maryland north of the Potomac River In 1849 Virginias piece was returned to it and is now Arlington County and part of the city of Alexandria Since 1849 all of Washington DC is on the north side of the Potomac River Washington DC used to have other small towns that used DC These include Georgetown DC and Alexandria DC

Since 1800 Washington DC is the home of all three branches of the US government Congress the President and the Supreme Court It is also the home of the World Bank the International Monetary Fund and the Organization of American States Because it is the home of the President and is important to American politics many groups hold large demonstrations and protests These are often on the National Mall a large open park that has many monuments and museums Washington DCs many museums and monuments make it a popular place for tourists to visit

Washington DC is called many things by many different people It can be called DC The District of Columbia The District or sometimes just Washington This can be confusing because there is also a US state called Washington To help with the confusion sometimes the state of Washington is called Washington State In 2005 the United States Census Bureau said that about 582049 people live in the District of Columbia

When English people first came to the area there was a Native American village on the spot called Nakochtank This name survives in the name of the Anacostia River This river was known for the healing properties of its pure water and it is recorded that the Emperor Powhatan who lived in what is now Richmond Virginia made the trip all the way to Nakochtank once for this reason Today this river is one of the most polluted in the world

The 1789 United States Constitution said that a capital city would be created in a district but did not say where it should be James Madison and others thought it should be far away from other states and cities This way it would be independent and not controlled by any state In 1790 a broken wikt linkcompromisecompromise was reached and capital was placed between Virginia and Maryland It was a square ten miles long on each side and split by the Potomac River which separated the two states Half of the district was in Maryland and the other half was in Virginia and the two states gave this land to the government In 1791 it was named Washington the District of Columbia to honor George Washington Columbia was another name for North America

Washington DC was planned before it was built Pierre LEnfant drew a plan for the city that said where all the streets parks and important buildings would be  Unlike most US cities DC has many roundabouts or traffic circles The city was supposed to have long and wide avenues and many open spaces for monuments and parks The National Mall a large park that connected the US Capitol to the Washington Monument was one of the most important parts of LEnfants plan

Washington DC is not a state and its citizens have less control over their city than most Americans While DC has an elected mayor and a city council since 1973 the US Congress controls the local government and can overturn or get rid of any local laws Congress and the people of DC often do not agree on what is best

The current mayor of Washington DC is Vincent C Gray a Democrat

The license plates on the cars in Washington DC say Taxation Without Representation This is a protest from people who live in Washington DC about having to pay taxes to the United States without having a vote in the United States House of Representatives It resembles the protest made by colonists before the American Revolution about having to pay taxes to England Some people are against letting Washington DC have a Congressman or Congresswoman because the Constitution only allows states to have Congressman or Congresswomen Other people are against it because Washington DC government is almost completely Democratic Party controlled

Washington DC is the center of the nation for its arts The National Symphony Orchestra the Washington National Opera and the Washington Ballet are all inside the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts The Kennedy Center Honors are given every year to the people who have greatly helped the cultural life of the United States The President and First Lady usually go to the Honors ceremony

According to a 2010 study Washington area commuters spent 70 hours a year in traffic delays which tied with Chicago for having the nations worst road congestion However 37 of Washington area commuters take public transportation to work the second highest rate in the country An additional 12 of DC commuters walked to work 6 carpooled and 3 traveled by bicycle in 2010

Washington has very few freeways The funds that had been dedicated for freeway construction were instead redirected to the regions public transportation infrastructure The interstate highways that do continue into Washington including Interstate 66 and Interstate 395 both terminate shortly upon entering the city

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority operates the Washington Metro the citys rapid transit system as well as Metrobus Both systems serve the District and its suburbs Metro opened on March 27 1976 and presently consists of 86 stations and convert1063mikm of track With an average of about one million trips each weekday Metro is the second busiest rapid transit system in the country after the New York City Subway Metrobus serves over 400000 riders each weekday making it the nations sixth largest bus system The city also operates its own DC Circulator bus system which connects commercial areas within central Washington

Union Station is the main train station in Washington DC and handles approximately 70000 people each day It is Amtraks second busiest station with 46 million passengers annually and serves as the southern terminus for the Northeast Corridor and Acela Express routes Marylands MARC and Virginias VRE commuter trains and the Metrorail Red Line also provide service into Union Station Expansion plans announced in 2011 will make Union Station the citys primary intercity bus transit center

Three major airports serve the District Washington National Airport is located across from downtown Washington in Arlington Virginia and has its own Metrorail station Major international flights arrive and depart from Washington Dulles International Airport located convert263mikm west of the District in Fairfax and Loudoun counties in Virginia Dulles will have a Metrorail station in 2016 Baltimore Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport is located convert317mikm northeast of the District in Anne Arundel County Maryland

The President of the United States of America is the head of state and head of government of the United States The office of President was created in the United States Constitution in 1788 The first President took office in 1789 The President serves as chief executive and is in charge of the executive branch of the United States government The United States Constitution makes the President the Commander in Chief of the armed forces It also lists powers given to the President These powers include

With the agreement of the United States Senate he or she can

John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was a philologist university professor and writer Tolkien is best known for his most famous works The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings

He was born in Bloemfontein South Africa but his parents were both from England He fought in World War I and after the war he found a job helping to produce the Oxford English Dictionary Tolkien was very interested in languages and he had studied at Oxford University Soon he became a professor of English Language at the University of Leeds He was then a professor at the University of Oxford until 1959 when he retired He also was good friends with many other writers and scholars most notably C S Lewis who wrote the Narnia books The Screwtape Letters and many essays on Christian theology Tolkien himself was a devout Catholic 

Tolkien married Edith Mary Bratt on March 22 1916 in England at the age of 24 They had four children three sons and a girl John Michael Christopher and Priscilla

He created and worked on the fictional fantasy world of Middle earth for most of his life and his most famous books are set in that world Because of his Middle earth books he is often considered the father of high fantasy which made the fantasy genre very popular

Tolkien wrote other books for example Farmer Giles Of Ham and also illustrated The Lord of the Rings The Lord of the Rings was published in three parts and has been made into several motion pictures The Lord of the Rings took 12 years to write

Adolescence is the time between being a child and full adult that is the period of time during which a person is biologically adult but emotionally not at full maturity The ages which are considered to be part of adolescence vary by culture but in the United States adolescence is usually considered to begin around age 13 and end around 18 In the English language adolescents are frequently called teenagers or teens which comes from the end the English words thirteen to nineteen Adolescence is cultural and so does not refer to a fixed time period The word comes from the Latin verb adolescere meaning to grow up During this time a persons body emotions and academic standing change a lot When adolescence happens in America children usually finish elementary school and enter secondary education such as middle school or high school

During this period of life most children go through the physical stages of puberty which often begin before a person has reached the age of 13 Most cultures think of people as becoming adults at various ages of the teenage years For example Jewish tradition thinks that people are adults at age 13 and this change is celebrated in the Bar Mitzvah and the Bat Mitzvah ceremony Usually there is a formal age of majority when adolescents formally become adults

KDE is a desktop environment for operating systems based on Linux or UNIX This replaces the console which is simply a black screen with text on it It is known for how good it can look and it is a very popular piece of software for users of Linux and UNIX

David Bowies first big hit record was the single Space Oddity in 1969 This album though only really sold well when he became more famous in 1973 Many of the songs are very melodic with good tunes and are unusual

The songs on this album are

A saxophone is a musical instrument that is made of brass and often just called a sax Due to the fact it is made from brass it is often involved in what is referred to as a brass section alongside true brass instruments like the trumpet or trombone However it is not a true brass instrument but a member of the woodwind family of instruments because it has a reed It was developed from the clarinet and shares many similarities to the clarinet The player blows into a reed fitted into the mouthpiece of the instrument 

There are several different kinds of saxophone In order from low to high pitch they are tubax contrabass bass baritone tenor alto soprano sopranino and soprillo However only the baritone tenor alto and soprano are commonly used

It was invented in 1842 by Adolphe Sax and is very popular with modern rock and pop musicians and often used in jazz music The big bands of the 1940s and 1950s always used it too Famous saxophone players were Marcel Mule and Charlie Parker The instrument is rarely used in a classical orchestra

The saxophone family is known as a transpositional family of instruments due to the fact that you do not have to alter the fingering when playing different ones

Bryophytes are simple plants they are the simplest known There are three types of bryophyte These are mosses liverworts and hornworts 

Bryophyta is the traditional term for this division of non vascular plants In some modern classifications the term is restricted to the mosses However as the groups shares some key features the term is still useful The non vascular plants are in any event related

It is thought that liverworts evolved from green algae Then other plants including moss and hornworts evolved from them

A person who studies bryophytes is called a bryologist The study of bryophytes is named bryology

Kent is a county in England It is just to the south east of London and is on the coast The sea to the East of Kent is the North Sea The sea south of Kent is called The English Channel by the British France is opposite Kent on the other side of The Channel At the most narrow point between Dover Calais and Cape Gris Nez The Channel is only 21 miles wide Dover is one of the main ports in Kent From here many ferries sail to and from France

Other main ports in Kent include Sheerness and Ramsgate The Channel Tunnel goes from Folkestone in Kent to France It was built in the late 1980s and early 1990s 

Kent is a very ancient county In the 6th and 7th centuries it was ruled by its own kings It is often called the garden of England because its countryside is very green and because it produces much fruit A lot of fruit such as strawberries are grown in Kent and the county is famous for growing hops which are used to make beer Maidstone is called the county town because the local government for Kent is based there

Another important town is the city of Canterbury The Archbishop of Canterbury is the head of the Church of England Hundreds of years ago many Christian people would travel to the Cathedral at Canterbury from their homes in other parts of Britain This was called making a pilgrimage 

Gavrilo Princip was the Serbian man who shot Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and the wife of the Archduke Archduchess Sophie Chotek These deaths are considered the main cause of First World War

Princip was born in Obljaj a poor area of Bosnia As a young man he joined a small group who wanted the Slavs in the south of Austria Hungary to join with Serbia in a new country They called themselves Young Bosnia A group of powerful people in Serbia decided to help them Those powerful people were called the Black Hand They gave Young Bosnia guns and small bombs 

When they heard that Franz Ferdinand was coming to Sarajevo six of them took the bombs and guns and waited for Ferdinand to drive past They were going to kill Ferdinand when he drove past Every one of them failed Gavrilo Princip went to a cafe to buy a sandwich

When Princip came out of the cafe he saw in front of him Ferdinand in his car The driver of the car had driven his car the wrong way and he stalled the car while trying to turn Princip walked up and shot Ferdinand He wanted to shoot the general who was also sitting in the car but Ferdinands wife Sophie threw her arms around Ferdinand She was in the way and Princip shot her instead of the general

At his trial Princip said he did it because he loved his people The Austrians thought it was a very bad crime but they could not kill him because he was only 19 years old The law in Austria Hungary said only people older than 20 could be killed even when the crime was as bad as killing royalty like Ferdinand They said Princip must stay in prison for 20 years They put him in a very bad prison During his time in the prison one of his arms was amputated He died in prison of tuberculosis and blood loss in the year 1918 

Because this crime happened Austria Hungary gave Serbia a list of things that Serbia had to do called an ultimatum to stop things like this from happening any more But it was just about impossible for Serbia to do all the things on the list fast enough because the Austrians really wanted war with Serbia Their German allies also wanted a big war This led to many of the European countries to start fighting

In mathematics or science a formula is a rule or statement written in algebraic symbols The plural of formula can be written in two ways formulae or formulas  the choice is based on personal preference 

Formulas use letters instead of words A simple example of a formula is y x Here if x is for example 1 then y x so y 1 Possibly the most famous formula is e m c 2 Albert Einstein created this In it e is energy m is mass and c is the speed of light Thus energy mass the speed of light 2 The multiplication sign is usually left out giving e mc 2

The formula e mc 2 is also an equation Every equation is a formula but not every formula is an equation For instance the formula xy is not an equation because no sign is used

Independence and Democracy is a group in the European Parliament It used to be called the Group of Europe of Democracies and Diversities It has about 37 members in it The members of this group either want their country to leave the European Union or want to change it

A musician is a person who plays a musical instrument like a guitar or a piano or a person that sings

A musician is also someone who writes music even if they write it for other people to play People who write music are called composers Usually that part is left out if they also play or sing the music they write but they are still composers because they wrote the music

Musicians can also make a group together to play songs If the group has many people playing instruments together like Beethovens music it is called an orchestra If it is just many people singing like in a church it is called a choir If it is only a few people together it is usually just called a band Sometimes a band has the same name as the singer

Conservatism is opposition to rapid changes disorder and extremes in society It began as a reaction to the Age of Enlightenment the neglect of the poor caused by leisurely interest in science and philosophy resulting in the extremely violent French Revolution Conservatism called for a return to faith love and peace It began in 1790 with the publication of English author Edmund Burkes book Reflections on the Revolution in France In his book he advocated for being satisfied and for caring government

Some conservatives seek to keep things as they are while others want a return to the way things were at an earlier time A conservative party in England formed which wanted better cooperation between rich and poor democracy and somewhat of a welfare state favoured by conservatives in France and other parts of Europe In the United States conservatives were suspicious of the welfare state and considered businessmen trustworthy on wages and prices

A machine is a thing that is created by people to make work easier

Some machines have many parts that move Examples are bicycles and clocks

Epistemology is the philosophy of knowledge It seeks to answer the questions What is knowledge and How is knowledge acquired

Epistemologists are philosophers who are interested in questions such as whether it is possible to have knowledge what kind of knowledge there is and how people come to know things

One of the first philosophers to make a clear statement on these questions was Xenophanes The following saying was and still is famous

This is an early kind of skepticism

There are other debates of this kind

The Eastern Orthodox Church is a Christian church Their type of Christianity is also called Eastern Orthodoxy Their members are called Eastern Orthodox although there is another group of Churches called Oriental Orthodox that is not Eastern Orthodox There are about 250 million Eastern Orthodox in the world Most Eastern Orthodox are found in Russia Greece Eastern Europe and the Middle East but there are Eastern Orthodox everywhere in the world

Eastern Orthodox believe in everything in the Nicene Creed

After this he continued to work with many others to fight against poverty and the Vietnam War

King had clearly made enemies in his rise to fame The Ku Klux Klan did what they could to hurt his reputation This was especially in the South Even the FBI kept a close eye on him On the evening of April 4 1968 while standing on the balcony of his motel room in Memphis Tennessee where he was preparing to lead a protest march in sympathy with striking garbage workers of that city a shot rang out the bullet entered through his right cheek and travelled down his neck severing the jugular vein and major arteries in the process before lodging in his shoulder King lay on the floor unconscious The unconscious King was rushed to St Josephs Hospital where doctors opened his chest and performed manual heart massage He never regained consciousness and died at 705 pm According to Taylor Branch Kings autopsy revealed that though he was only 39 years old he had the heart of a 60 year old man His death led to riots in many cities In March 1969 James Earl Ray was found guilty of killing King He was sentenced to 99 years in prison Ray died in 1998 his brother having disconnected life support he was attached to since February 11

In 1986 America created a national holiday It is commonly known as Martin Luther King Jr Day in his honor It is celebrated on the third Monday of the month of January This is around the time of his birthday The holiday was created because people had campaigned for this to happen including singer Stevie Wonder He wrote a song for the campaign

Queen Victoria was the queen of Great Britain and Ireland from 1837 until 1901 She was on the throne longer than any other king or queen in the history of the United Kingdom She was born in 1819 and became queen at the age of 18 on the death of her uncle William IV

She was educated by her governess Louise Lehzen and the Reverend George Davys

In 1840 she married her cousin Prince Albert who encouraged science trade and art They had nine children and made it clear they believed that a good family life and Christianity were very important In general English people followed their example

In 1851 the Great Exhibition at Crystal Palace was opened by the Queen It happened partly because of Alberts hard work and the exhibition featured the achievements of British people

In 1861 Prince Albert died and Victoria began to keep away from public life this made her less popular During the years that followed Britain became more powerful and in 1887 Victoria was given the title Empress of India She became more popular with her people In 1897 she had her Diamond Jubilee to celebrate 60 years as queen

Many of Victorias children became monarchs or princes and princesses of other countries Queen Victoria was always very interested in India although she never went there She was also very fond of Scotland and painting which she did herself photography singing and kept a regular diary throughout her life

She died in 1901

The novel was adapted for the screen by Charles Leavitt the movie was shot in Toronto Canada and Cincinnati Ohio and directed by Peter Chelsom and released in 1998 

In the beginning of the book Maxwell Max Kane is a boy with low self esteem or kinda like his father in the way that he is slow He lives with his grandparents Grim and Gram Max thinks of himself as stupid pie eating fool and is in learning disabled classes and people are afraid of him because he looks like his father Killer Kane a convicted murderer Max sets the stage for the story by reminiscing about his time in daycare when he was known as Kicker and Kevin the other major character was known as Freak Kevin was always different because he was small and needed crutches and then leg braces to walk But Max respected him even back then for his death glare and thought the crutches and leg braces were cool Many years later when Max is in middle school the real story begins 

Max finds out that people are moving into the house next door The new neighbors turn out to be Freak and his mother Gwen who Freak calls The Fair Gwen after King Arthurs wife The boys make friends They go to the Fourth of July fireworks together and puts Freak on his shoulders so he can see The local tough guy Tony D Blade chases the two with his gang because Freak called him a cretin With Maxs size and speed and Freaks directions and master plan of running into the pond they keep themselves safe until they are rescued by the police After this incident Freak starts riding on Maxs shoulders They call their combined form Freak the Mighty The friendship is good for them both they stick up for each other and Kevin even teaches Max to read and learn properly They go on adventures such as going to the hospital which Freak claims has a secret department called the Bionics Department which has had his brain cat scanned to be fitted into an artificial body On one adventure they find a womans purse in the sewer They return it to the woman who is named Loretta Lee She is the wife of Iggy Lee boss of the Panheads a motorcycle gang who striked fear in everyone even the cops as Max puts it Iggy says that the two of them once knew Maxs father They consider having some fun with the boys but do not because they are afraid that Maxs father will get parole even though hes serving a life sentence They also reveal that Kevins father left once he heard his son had a birth defect

Global warming is a slow but steady rise in Earths surface temperature Temperatures today are 074 C higher than 150 years ago Some people think that the warming is because of people burning fossil fuels like coal and oil Some also think that humans are cutting down too many trees Most scientists believe that the sun actually became colder and is not to blame If this is so the Earth should be a small amount colder Many scientists say that the temperature will rise about 37 C more in 100 years Most major governments and science groups agree with these ideas

If the earths temperature becomes hotter the sea level will also become higher because the temperature rise will make ice glaciers melt The sea level rise may cause coastal areas to flood Weather patterns including where and how much precipitation there is will change Deserts will increase in size in some areas and decrease in others Colder areas will become warmer faster than warm areas Strong storms may become more likely and farming may not make as much food These effects will not be the same over the entire Earth The changes from one area to another are not well known

People in government have talked about global warming They do not agree on what to do about it Humans can burn less fossil fuels adapt to any temperature changes or try to change the Earth to reduce warming The Kyoto Protocol tries to reduce pollution from the burning of fossil fuels Most governments have agreed to it Some people in government think nothing should change

Since the 1800s people have recorded the daily temperature In about 1850 the number of temperature measurements worldwide was enough to allow scientists to estimate the global average temperature From 1920 to 1940 the temperature got warmer From 1940 to 1970 the temperature got slightly cooler From 1970 to today the global temperature has increased by about 06 02 C Starting in 1979 satellites started measuring the temperature of the Earth

Before 1800 we have no records that show how warm or cold it was There have been many scientific studies trying to figure out past temperatures before people used thermometers using proxy measurements This means measuring one thing and using it to explain another thing One way is to cut into a tree and measure how it is between tree rings Trees that live a long time can give us an idea of how temperature and rain have changed while it was alive Many scientists agree that over the past 2000 years the temperature has been quite stable but there have been some times where the temperatures have increased such as the Medieval Warm Period or decreased such as the Little Ice Age Other proxy measurements such as bore holes show the same pattern as tree rings Tree rings and bore holes can only help scientists work out the temperature until about 1000 years ago Ice cores are also used to find out the temperature back to about half a million years ago Ice cores show that the Earth goes through cycles of ice ages about every 100000 years and that it is not a stable temperature 

Coal burning power plants car exhausts factory smokestacks and other man made waste gas vents give off about 23 billion tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the Earths atmosphere each year The atmospheric concentration of CO2 has increased by 31 above pre industrial levels since 1750 This is a lot higher than at any time during the last 425000 years the information for which has been collected from ice cores From less direct geological evidence people believe that CO2 values this high were last reached 40 million years ago About three quarters of the anthropogenic emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere during the past 20 years are due to fossil fuel burning The rest is mostly because changes in how land is used especially deforestation

The sun becomes hotter and colder every 11 years This is called the 11 year sunspot cycle The temperature of the sun does not change much during this cycle On Earth the change in temperature is very small Scientists can barely detect it If the sun was causing the Earth to warm up scientists would be able to measure the temperature rise both at the surface and high up in the air However the higher air is actually getting colder

People also make a lot of dust and dirt Some of this dirt is large so it falls out within a few hours Some is so small that it could stay in the air for years This big dirt is still very small Its about the width of a human hair The big dirt does not stay in the air for years though because rain hits it and brings it to the surface It actually only stays in the air for about 7 days But this is still a long time and can cause changes in the temperature of the Earth

There are two main ways that people think global warming can be stopped The first is to stop putting greenhouse gases in the atmosphere Many people have tried to get countries to stop emitting greenhouse gases The Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997 It was supposed to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to below their levels in 1990 As of 2010 the Kyoto Protocol has not worked in reducing greenhouse gas levels Carbon dioxide levels today are the highest they have been since the start of the Industrial Revolution

The second is for people to change how they live because of any changes that global warming will bring The amount of money a country has will affect how easily it adapts Rich countries like the United States will be able to change more easily while poor countries such as Bangladesh may not be able to change

The term global warming was probably first used in its modern sense on 8 August 1975 in a science paper by Wally Broecker in the journal Science called Are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming Broeckers choice of words was new and represented a significant recognition that the climate was warming previously the phrasing used by scientists was inadvertent climate modification because while it was recognized humans could change the climate no one was sure which direction it was going The National Academy of Sciences first used global warming in a 1979 paper called the Charney Report it said if carbon dioxide continues to increase we find no reason to doubt that climate changes will result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible The report made a distinction between referring to surface temperature changes as global warming while referring to other changes caused by increased CO2 as climate change

Global warming became more widely popular after 1988 when NASA climate scientist James Hansen used the term in a testimony to Congress He said global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming His testimony was widely reported and afterward global warming was commonly used by the press and in public discourse

House music is a type of dance music It began during the early 1980s from disco and the black American soul music tradition It takes its name from the Warehouse a Chicago club where DJs first played their records to a large audience  The original House sound is characterized by four on the floor beats at 120 130 BPM forward driven bass lines an emphasis on the second and fourth beats of each measure handclaps and cymbals Over the years house has created many types of house music These include

Ammonia is a chemical Its formula is NH3 It is made from nitrogen and hydrogen atoms

If a goldfish tank is dirty from their waste they can suffer from ammonia burns which cause black spots or patches to come up on their body Make sure the tank is big enough and filtered

Because of its many uses ammonia is one of the most highly produced inorganic chemicals Dozens of chemical plants worldwide produce ammonia The worldwide ammonia production in 2004 was 109 million metric tonnes China produced 284 of the worldwide production followed by India with 86 Russia with 84 and the United States with 82 About 80 or more of the ammonia produced is used for fertilizing agricultural crops

Before the start of World War I most ammonia was obtained by the dry distillation of nitrogenous vegetable and animal waste products including camel dung where it was distilled by the reduction of nitrous acid and nitrites with hydrogen in addition it was produced by the distillation of coal and also by the decomposition of ammonium salts by alkaline hydroxides such as quicklime the salt most generally used being the chloride thus

Today the typical modern ammonia producing plant first converts natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas or petroleum naphtha into gaseous hydrogen The process used in producing the hydrogen begins with removal of sulfur compounds from the natural gas Catalytic hydrogenation converts organosulfur compounds into gaseous hydrogen sulfide

The hydrogen sulfide is then removed by passing the gas through beds of zinc oxide where it is adsorbed and converted to solid zinc sulfide

Catalytic steam reforming of the sulfur free feedstock is then used to form hydrogen plus carbon monoxide

In the next step the water gas shift reaction is used to convert the carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide and more hydrogen

The carbon dioxide is then removed either by absorption in aqueous ethanolamine solutions or by adsorption in pressure swing adsorbers using proprietary solid adsorption media

The final step in producing the hydrogen is to use catalytic methanation to remove any small residual amounts of carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide from the hydrogen

To produce ammonia the hydrogen then reacts with nitrogen using a magnetite catalyst under high pressure to form anhydrous liquid ammonia This step is known as the ammonia synthesis loop

Hydrogen required for ammonia synthesis could also be produced economically using other sources like coal or coke gasification less economically from the electrolysis of water into oxygen hydrogen and other alternatives that are presently impractical for large scale production At one time most of Europes ammonia was produced from the Hydro plant at Vemork using electrolysis

In chemistry an alkali is an aqueous solution with a pH value of more than seven The word Alkali comes from the Arabic qali meaning from the ashes since ashes mixed with water were used as cleaning products and feel soapy

An alkali is where a base is dissolved in water Often it is the salt of an Alkali metal

An alkali is the opposite to an acid and can be neutralised by adding acid

Someone can find out how strong or weak an alkali is by adding universal indicator to it Some universal indicators can be poured into alkalis and some are soaked into paper and the paper is touched to the alkali

For example soap and toothpaste are minor strength alkalis Lye is a strong alkali

The Millennium Dome is a large dome shaped building in Greenwich in South East London UK It was built in 19972000 to celebrate the beginning of the third millennium The name was officially changed to The O2 when Telefnica O2 Europe plc bought the naming rights from the developers Anschutz Entertainment Group

From 31 December 1999 until 31 December 2000 the Dome and some surrounding buildings were the home of the Millennium Exhibition which was meant to show the best of Britain to the world The most successful part of the Exhibition was the stage show that was held two or three times each day in the middle of the dome The show had dozens of dancers and acrobats music by Peter Gabriel and a tower that rose out of the domes floor

The rest of the Exhibition was not as successful as the Domes owners had hoped About 6 and a half million people visited the Exhibition which was only half the number its owners hoped for

The dome was sold to US Anschutz Entertainment Group and reopened in July 2007 as the O2 an entertainment complex including a 22000 seat concert and sports venue cinema music club and exhibition spaces Among the first artists to perform there were Bon Jovi and Prince The Rolling Stones performed there in August 2007 Led Zeppelin played a reunion show there in December 2007 and the Spice Girls took residence in the arena from December 2007 to January 2008

A millennium is a time period of one thousand years The word millennium is derived from two Latin words mille and annum

The Falkland Islands are about 300 miles east of Argentina Argentina and the UK had a short war in 1982 because Argentina claims to own the islands The war lasted 6 weeks and about 1000 soldiers were killed The UK defeated Argentina and after this the governments of the two countries would not negotiate with each other In 1990 they began to have talks again Oil and gas has been found below the sea around the islands Argentina and the UK have agreed to share the oil and gas There is also oil and gas outside the sea area that belongs to the UK This is owned by Argentina

Professor Neil Alden Armstrong was born on August 5th 1930 in Ohio and grew up on a farm with his grandparents in the United States He was an American astronaut an American aviator and a former astronaut test pilot aerospace engineer university professor and United States Naval Aviator and the first person to set foot on the Earths moon On July 20 1969 Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon in a small spacecraft that had been sent to the moon using the Saturn V rocket The rocket was called Apollo 11 They both walked on the moon and millions of people watched and heard this event on live television He earned a bachelor of science degree in aeronautical engineering from the Purdue University and a master of science degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Southern California In 1970 he received an Honorary Doctorate of Engineering from the Purdue University From 1971 to 1979 he became professor for aerospace engineering at the University of Cincinnati

Vegetarianism is the practice of not eating meat or fish People who follow vegetarianism are called vegetarians Vegetarians eat foods like vegetables fruits nuts beans and grains Some vegetarians eat or drink animal products like milk and eggs They are called lacto ovo vegetarians Vegetarian people usually like tofu falafel and other meat substitutes

There are many reasons for not eating meat Some think that it is wrong to kill animals others think that eating meat is bad for their health or the world This is because land used for animals can be used to grow food Some people may become vegetarians because their religion says not to eat animals

Vegetarians who do not eat milk and eggs are called vegans Vegans also often will not use animal products like leather but many vegetarians do use animal products

Some people who call themselves vegetarians and eat fish or sea food are not vegetarians because fish and sea creatures are also animals Such people are sometimes called pescetarians There are also many people who are not vegetarians but do not eat too much animal food Some eat only very little meat some eat only fowl There is also a philosophy called freeganism it means eating animal products only if otherwise they will be thrown away to garbage  such as food thrown away by restaurants

The Hindu who believes in non injury or nonviolence naturally adopts a vegetarian diet It is a matter of conscience more than anything else The Vedic and Puranic scriptures of Hinduism explain that animals have souls and the act of killing animals brings bad karma because the killer will suffer the pain of the animal he has killed in this life or the next Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami adds that when we eat meat fish fowl and eggs we absorb the vibration of the creatures into our nerves This promotes fear anger jealousy confusion resentment and the like The Manu Dharma Shastras state When the diet is pure the mind and heart are pure Generally there is the belief based on scriptures such as Bhagavad Gita that ones food shapes the personality mood and mind

A hydrocarbon is a type of chemical compound It is made of only hydrogen and carbon atoms They can be found in crude oil and are separated by fractional distillation The hydrogen and carbon are bonded with non polar covalent bonds Because of its lack of polar covalent bonds hydrocarbons cannot create hydrogen bonds with water and are hydrophobic 

Hydrocarbons are grouped into families or homologous series There are five main families The hydrocarbons in each family have a general formula and similar physical and chemical properties

Alkanes are the simplest hydrocarbons Their general formula is CnH2n2

Alkenes are similar to alkanes The main difference between them is that alkenes have a carbon to carbon double bond The general formula for the alkenes is CnH2n

Note that there is no Methene Methene is not possible as alkenes require a carbon carbon double bond and methane only has one carbon atom

Alkynes have a carbon to carbon triple bond CnH2n 2 is their general formula

Methyne does not exist because of methanes one carbon atom

Cycloalkanes are isomers of alkenes They have the same general formula the only difference is that they do not have a carbon to carbon double bond

Note that the alkane Methane and the alkene Ethene do not have a cycloalkane because they can only form a straight line

Alkadienes have two carbon to carbon double bonds Their general formula is CnH2n 2 They are isomers of Alkynes

Aromatic hydrocarbons are aromatic organic molecules that form flat ring shaped bonds The most simplest of aromatic hydrocarbons are benzene and indole They can have one ring heterocyclic like benzene or 2 rings bicyclic like napthalene or many rings polycyclic like anthracene

Civil engineering is the term for the work of designing and building infrastructure It usually means large structures like bridges dams buildings and tunnels It also covers complicated networks such as water irrigation and sewerage networks Civil engineers can be involved in all stages in the life of infrastructure from planning and construction to maintenance and demolition 

Civil engineering is made up of many different areas or disciplines Some important areas are geotechnical structures environmental construction management hydrology transportation and materials It is important for civil engineers to have an understanding of all these disciplines as projects often involve many of them at the same time

Civil engineers are responsible for lots of the things that are required for a society to function properly Safe water supplies sewage treatment roads railways and buildings are all part of civil engineering

To work in civil engineering requires training Construction workers will train at a center and on the job 

To be a professional in civil engineering requires study at a university or college Civil engineers often study subjects like structures materials physics and calculus

The profession of civil engineering is represented by professional bodies in various countries In the UK the Institution of Civil Engineers promotes civil engineering as a discipline and supports engineers throughout their careers The American Society of Civil Engineers performs a similar task in the USA 

Professional engineers often choose to become Chartered Engineers Chartership shows employers and clients that they are both qualified and experienced in their jobs Civil engineers usually have to write a big essay and take an interview with a panel of experienced engineers to gain chartership

The Golden Gate Bridge is a bridge that crosses over the San Francisco Bay It goes from San Francisco to Marin County in the US state of California It was opened for use in 1937 It is 9266 ft long When the bridge was finished it was the longest bridge in the world Now there are eight bridges that are longer For many people it is still one of the most beautiful bridges in the world

Before the bridge the only way to go north from San Francisco to Marin County was by ferry The trip by ferry took 20 minutes to complete Before the bridge was built San Francisco was the biggest American city still served mostly by ferries Some experts did not think that people could build a bridge because the water currents between Marin and San Francisco were very strong Also the water was very deep in the middle  102 m  and there was a lot of wind and fog that could make the construction difficult

In 1916 San Franciscos city engineer asked other engineers to propose ideas for a bridge One man Joseph Strauss designed a very cheap bridge  only 17 million but many thought it was ugly Local authorities asked him to change the design and to work with other experts He accepted He and other experts especially Irving Morrow an architect designed the bridge again this time as a suspension bridge A suspension bridge has tall towers that hold long cables and the cables hold up or suspend the bridge

The bridge is called the Golden Gate Bridge because it crosses the Golden Gate Strait the area of water between the San Francisco peninsula and the Marin County peninsula

In 1930 people in San Francisco and Marin County agreed that the local governments could sell bonds to raise money for the bridge The new bridge was going to cost 301 million But it was difficult for the governments to sell the bonds at the time because of the Wall Street Crash of 1929 Finally the Bank of America which was based in San Francisco agreed to buy all the bonds to help the local economy

Construction began on January 5 1933 and was finished in April 1937 During the construction eleven men died and the builders put a net under the bridge for the safety of the builders Nineteen men were saved by the net

When they finished the bridge they painted it with a reddish orange sealant a type of paint that protects the bridge from water and humidity People liked the color because it looked good with the bridges surroundings and it was easy to see in the fog so the bridge was officially painted with the color called International Orange

People can cross the bridge in cars or motorcycles any time During daylight hours they can cross by bicycle or on foot They can not cross the bridge on roller skates skateboards or mopeds

When the bridge opened drivers had to pay 50 cents to cross the bridge in either direction Today when drivers go north on the bridge they do not have to pay but starting on September 2 2008 when they go south they have to pay 6 if they pay cash or 5 if they buy a Fastrak pass

People often jump off the bridge to commit suicide They fall 75 meters and most of them die when they hit the water Nobody knows how many people have committed suicide by jumping off the bridge

A suburb is an area of a town or city a little away from the main part where there are fewer big buildings and mainly houses schools and shops These are called suburbs or the suburbs Sometimes cities have suburbs that are over a very large area The suburbs are still part of the city but may have a different name from the main city or town

Since the beginning of the twentieth century cities have spread very quickly and spread farther Transport in the form of trams buses and cars mean that people can live farther away from their place of work This led to the growth of the suburbs Housing commonly includes detached and semi detached houses bungalows and flats Less houses are built than in the inner city and there is often space for gardens and parks

As cities grow outwards they begin to take over the surrounding countryside Green belts have been created on the undeveloped land around a city to prevent urban sprawl and to prevent the towns and cities merging into one It also encourages development within the town while also protecting the countryside Today the enormous need for new houses particularly large detached and semi detached houses in pleasant surroundings means that some areas of green belt land have been built on and others are threatened The reason is that it is cheaper to build on green belt land than to redevelop brownfield sites in older parts of the town or city 

A skyscraper is a very tall building usually more than 152 metres in height A highrise is another name that people call skyscrapers Skyscrapers are almost always found in cities Many large cities have many skyscrapers For example New York a large city in the USA has a famous skyscraper called the Empire State Building In the last 20 years people have been building skyscrapers in cities like London England that did not have many tall buildings in the past

At the start the word skyscraper meant a tall sail on a sailing ship The words meaning has changed and today it means a tall building Until the nineteenth century buildings taller than six stories tall were not common Tall buildings made out of weak metals would fall down People also did not like walking up many steps Also running water could only be brought up to fifty feet high

Better technology helped make skyscrapers more common Stronger building materials such as steel and reinforced concrete were developed so stronger skyscrapers could be built Water pumps brought water up to heights above fifty feet

The first skyscraper The Home Insurance Building was built in Chicago Illinois USA William LeBaron Jenney designed it The building ten stories high was built in 1884 and 1885 It was destroyed in 1931 because they wanted to build another building in its previous place

The Golden Rule is a moral that says to treat others how you would like them to treat you This moral is used as a basis in the human rights It is called the golden rule because there is value in having this kind of respect and caring attitude for one another

People of many religions see the value of this mandate and have similar expressions In Christianity Jesus Christ taught this idea to his disciples and others when he gave his Sermon on the Mount It is recorded in the Holy Bible in the book of Matthew Chapter 7 and verse 12 Jesus explained to his listeners that all the things that were recorded in the Jewish law and that the prophets had taught about concerning morality was summed up in this one rule The context of this statement is in regard to Gods mercy and kindness The principle that was shared is to not always treat others as they might deserve to be treated as we may judge some as undeserving but instead to always be merciful and charitable not withholding good 

Some philosophers consider the idea that this statement can be interpreted according to ones personal ethics which may include wishing harm to ones self so that it instead becomes permissive to harm others What Jesus said was to not be judgemental as we all make mistakes do not focus on the behavior of others but instead focus on your own behavior and attitude and let it be good In other religions and belief systems there is a similar concept of the ethic of reciprocity also called the Golden Rule However there is an important distinguishing trait about the Golden Rule of Christianity The gold in the Golden Rule is given without expectation of the act or attitude being recipricated If every one gave freely of themselves in this way we would become rich indeed and perhaps begin to see the goodness of God in effect as He intended it to be

The golden rule is one of the two main pillars of Christianity but it is not restricted to Christianity only Almost all ethical religions of the world know it It can be written either in active form or in passive form

During the Great Depression Pepsi gained popularity following the introduction in 1936 of a 12 ounce bottle Initially priced at 10 cents sales were slow but when the price was slashed to five cents sales increased substantially With a radio advertising campaign featuring the jingle Pepsi Cola hits the spot Twelve full ounces thats a lot Twice as much for a nickel too Pepsi Cola is the drink for you arranged in such a way that the jingle never ends Pepsi encouraged price watching consumers to switch obliquely referring to the Coca Cola standard of six ounces per bottle for the price of five cents instead of the 12 ounces Pepsi sold at the same price Coming at a time of economic crisis the campaign succeeded in boosting Pepsis status In 1937 500000000 bottles of Pepsi were consumed From 1936 to 1938 Pepsi Colas profits doubled

Pepsis success under Guth came while the Loft Candy business was faltering Since he had initially used Lofts finances and facilities to establish the new Pepsi success the near bankrupt Loft Company sued Guth for possession of the Pepsi Cola company A long legal battle Guth v Loft then ensued with the case reaching the Delaware Supreme Court and ultimately ending in a loss for Guth

In 1975 Pepsi introduced the Pepsi Challenge marketing campaign where PepsiCo set up a blind tasting between Pepsi Cola and rival Coca Cola During these blind taste tests the majority of participants picked Pepsi as the better tasting of the two soft drinks PepsiCo took great advantage of the campaign with television commercials reporting the results to the public

In 1976 Pepsi RKO Bottlers in Toledo Ohio hired the first female Pepsi salesperson Denise Muck to coincide with the United States bicentennial celebration

In 1996 PepsiCo launched the highly successful Pepsi Stuff marketing strategy By 2002 the strategy was cited by Promo Magazine as one of 16 Ageless Wonders that helped redefine promotion marketing

In late 2008 Pepsi overhauled their entire brand simultaneously introducing a new logo and a minimalist label design The redesign was comparable to Coca Colas earlier simplification of their can and bottle designs Also in 4th quarter of 2008 Pepsi teamed up with GoogleYoutube to produce the first daily entertainment show on Youtube Poptub This daily show deals with pop culture internet viral videos and celebrity gossip Poptub is updated daily from Pepsi

Since 2007 Pepsi Lays and Gatorade have had a Bring Home the Cup contest for Canadas biggest hockey fans Hockey fans were asked to submit content for a chance at winning a party in their hometown with the Stanley Cup and Mark Messier

Penguins are sea birds They form the family Spheniscidae the only family of the order Sphenisciformes

Penguins live on the southern half of the world Antarctica New Zealand southern Australia South Africa and South America

All penguins have a white belly and a dark back Penguins cannot fly but they can swim very well They have good hearing and can see underwater The white and black colors are for camouflage when they swim So when a predator looking from underwater sees the white belly and wings of the penguin they can not see it well with the light coming from above Also from above the penguins black backs can not be seen well in the dark water The biggest penguins may stand nearly 4 feet tall and can weigh almost 100 pounds The smallest kinds are only about one foot tall Penguins also have a thick layer of blubber that helps them be warm and their feathers are very tightly packed to make another cover They also have a layer of woolly down under the feathers that are coated with a type of oil that makes them waterproof

Penguins eat krill or fish and are at home in the ocean They come up on the land or ice to lay their eggs and raise the chicks The animals all nest together in a huge group called a broken wikt linkrookeryrookery They usually make nests on the ground with rocks or mud

After the penguins mate the mother lays her egg on the ice before winter She lets the father take care of it by putting it on his foot and covering it up with his warm belly The mother then goes for two months to live in the ocean eating and eating and getting fat The fathers all huddle together in a group to help protect each others eggs They do not eat anything but live off the fat on their bodies

When the baby penguin comes out of the egg the father gives it a milk like liquid that he makes inside his throat Soon the mother joins them and gives the baby some food The hungry father will go out to the ocean and find some food He will return after weeks and then the two of the parents will take turns going out finding food and coming back to take care of their chick penguins eat krill fish squid and other small animals from the ocean which they catch net als henk

There are 16 19 living species of penguins The White flippered Penguin is today generally considered a subspecies of the Little Penguin It is still unclear if the Royal Penguin is a subspecies of the Macaroni Penguin It is also possible that northern and southern Rockhopper Penguins are separate species It is a common misconception that some species of penguins withhold pouches however this is not true

Cannibalism is where an animal eats its own species If it refers to humans some people call it anthropophagy 

If it occurs in humans scientists are unclear if it is widespread or not There are certain diseases like the sleeping disease that are passed on by eating human nerve tissue especially the brain Sometimes cannibalism was observed with people that have mental problems or some diseases of the mind

An example of cannibalism by humans was the Donner Party in 1846 and 1847

In non human species cannibalism is quite common for example with spiders and scorpions There the male gets eaten by the female after having sex

She was born in Coyoacn Mexico She had polio that left her disabled when she was 6 years old and some people think that she may have had spina bifida as well She studied medicine and was going to become a doctor Because of a traffic accident at age 18 which badly injured her she had periods of severe pain for the rest of her life After this accident Kahlo no longer continued her medical studies but took up painting She used ideas about things that had happened to her Her paintings are often shocking in the way they show pain and the harsh lives of women especially her feelings about not being able to have children Fifty five of her 143 paintings are of herself She was also influenced by native Mexican culture shown in bright colors with a mixture of realism and symbolism Her paintings attracted the attention of the artist Diego Rivera whom she later married

Kahlos work is sometimes called surrealist and although she organized art shows several times with European surrealists she herself did not like that labelfactdateJanuary 2010 Her attention to female themes and the honesty in her painting them made her something of a feminist cult figure in the last decades of the 20th century Some of her work is seen at the Frida Kahlo Museum found in her birthplace and home in suburban Mexico City

Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream is a book written by Hunter S Thompson The book is based on an article Thompson wrote for Rolling Stone magazine It was later made into a movie directed by Terry Gilliam and starring Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro

The novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas accounts for two trips to Las Vegas Nevada that Hunter S Thompson and attorney Oscar Zeta Acosta took in March and April 1971 The first trip spawned from an expos Thompson was writing for Rolling Stone magazine about the Mexican American television journalist Ruben Salazar whom officers of the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Office had shot and killed with a tear gas grenade fired at close range during the National Chicano Moratorium March against the Vietnam War in 1970 Thompson was using Acosta a prominent Mexican American political activist and attorney as a central source for the story and the two found it difficult for a brown skinned Mexican to talk openly with a white reporter in the racially tense atmosphere of Los Angeles California The two needed a more comfortable place to discuss the story and decided to take advantage of a Sports Illustrated magazine offer to write photograph captions for the annual Mint 400 desert race being held in Las Vegas

The 1971 Thompson and Acosta personae on which Raoul Duke and Dr Gonzo were based Thompson wrote that he concluded their March trip by spending some thirty six hours alone in a hotel room feverishly writing in my notebook about his experiences The genesis of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream is in that notebook

What originally was a two hundred fifty word photo caption job for Sports Illustrated grew to a novel length feature story for Rolling Stone Thompson said publisher Jann Wenner had liked the first 20 or so jangled pages enough to take it seriously on its own terms and tentatively scheduled it for publication which gave me the push I needed to keep working on it He had first submitted a 2500 word manuscript to Sports Illustrated that was aggressively rejected

Weeks later Thompson and Acosta returned to Las Vegas to report for Rolling Stone on the National District Attorneys Associations Conference on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs being held from the 25 to 29 April 1971 and to add material to the larger Fear and Loathing narrative Besides attending the attorneys conference Thompson and Acosta looked for ways in Vegas to explore the theme of the American Dream which was the basis for the novels second half which Thompson referred at the time as Vegas II On 29 April 1971 he began writing the full manuscript in a hotel room in Arcadia California in his spare time while completing Strange Rumblings in Aztlan the article chronicling the slain Chicano journalist Rubn Salazar

Rolling Stone magazine cover by Ralph Steadman In November 1971 Rolling Stone published the combined texts of the trips as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream as a two part article illustrated by Ralph Steadman who two years before had worked with Thompson on a Scanlans Monthly article titled The Kentucky Derby is Decadent and Depraved The next year Random House quickly published the hardcover edition with additional Steadman illustrations The New York Times said it is by far the best book yet on the decade of dope with Tom Wolfe describing it as a scorching epochal sensation

Tunisia is a country in North Africa Tunis is its capital

Since history has been recorded there were Berber tribes living in Tunisia Most of them built little towns and ports along the coastline so they could trade with different travellers from everywhere in the Mediterranean Sea Most of the travellers that used to pass by Tunisia were Phoenicians who started to settle on the Tunisian coast during the 10th Century BC Later in the 8th Century BC Carthage was built by some settlers that came from Phoenicia and regions abroad After many wars against Greece in 6th Century BC Carthage dominated the Mediterranean Sea

During the Second Punic War Carthage invaded Italy with an army led by Hannibal The series of wars between the Roman Empire and Carthage ended with the destruction of Carthage in the 2nd Century BC After the destruction of the Carthaginian civilization the region became under the Roman Empire control

When the Roman Empire became weak the Vandals occupied that region This was in the 5th Century AD and one hundred years after that it became under the control of the Byzantine emperor Justinian

Basketball is a very popular sport worldwide played with a round orange ball that bounces The ball is also called a basketball The sport was invented in Springfield Massachusetts by a professor named Dr James Naismith in the year 1891 

Basketball is now the second most popular sport in the world It has been played in the summer Olympic Games since 1936 Womens basketball is also a popular sport

In early December 1891 James Naismith a physical education teacher at Springfield College in Springfield Massachusetts invented an indoor game to keep his students from becoming bored After rejecting other ideas he invented basketball Naismith wrote the basic rules and then nailed a peach basket onto a 10 foot tall pole Unlike modern basketball hoops the bottom of the peach basket was still there so after a point was scored somebody had to get the ball out of the basket with a long stick Over time people made a hole at the bottom of the basket so the ball could go through more easily

The score of the first game of basketball ever played was 1  0 There is a sculpture in Springfield on the spot where the first game was played The international Basketball Hall of Fame is also in Springfield Massachusetts

The aim of basketball is to score more points than your opponents Each goal is worth two points You get points by shooting the ball into the opponents basket The team with the most points at the end of the game wins

The court where the game is played is a rectangle shape and at both endlines there is a goal called a hoop in the shape of a circular basket with the bottom cut out

In each game of basketball these things are required

Basketball is played with two teams with 5 players from each team on the court at one time The players that are not on the court can sit on the bench with a maximum of 7 players on the bench This allows for a total of 12 players When a player wants to substitute for another player on the court they tell the score bench who will signal the substitute to the referee at the next available opportunity The referees will then signal the player on to the court and the substitute will become a player and the player will become a substitute

Whales are large marine mammals which live in the ocean Like other mammals they breathe oxygen from the air have a small amount of hair and are warm blooded 

There are two basic kinds of whale baleen whales and toothed whales and about 100 species

People use the word whale in different ways Some use it for all Cetaceans including dolphins and porpoises These people say that dolphins and porpoises were also whales because they are also Cetaceans Others separate out the dolphins and porpoises common English speaking people have never called them or thought of them as whales unless they are very large Actually there is no clear line between whales and dolphins

Whales have been killed for meat and oil by whalers However many countries havelaws saying not to kill whales anymore Some countries including Iceland and Japan do not have these laws In other countries such as the USA only Eskimos and some American Indians may legally kill whales

Baleen whales eat plankton clouds of very small things floating in the water The whales mouths are huge They open their mouths very wide and hold a big mouthful of sea water Their throats stretch very wide to make the space inside their mouth even bigger Then they close their mouth and squeeze out the seawater The food does not escape because instead of teeth these whales have filters called baleen This is very different from the way that toothed whales eat

Toothed whales eat larger fish or meat and are like big dolphins They have sharp teeth and usually have a big forehead Inside the big forehead is a chamber to make and direct sounds They make all kinds of sounds including sounds so loud they can shock fish Some of the sounds are so loud they can use echos to locate things that they can not see Some toothed whales for example the sperm whale are almost never called dolphins Some of them are always called dolphins Others are like dolphins in some ways and like whales in others

Cetaceans are divided into two suborders

Both cetaceans and artiodactyl are now classified under the super order Cetartiodactyla which includes both whales and hippopotamuses Whales are the hippopotamuss closest living relatives

All cetaceans including whales dolphins and porpoises are descendants of land living mammals of the Artiodactyl order Both are related to Indohyus from which they split around 54 million years ago Primitive whales probably first took to the sea about 50 million years ago and became fully aquatic about 5 10 million years later Pakicetus is an important transitional species

Because of their environment whales are conscious breathers they decide when to breathe Whales breathe through blowholes Baleen whales have two and toothed whales have one These are on the top of the head the animal breathes while mostly submerged Breathing first expells excess water from the blowhole forming an upward spout followed by inhaling air into the lungs 

All mammals sleep including whales but they cannot stay in an unconscious state for too long because they need to be conscious to breathe It is thought that only one hemisphere of their brains sleeps at a time so that whales are never completely asleep but still get the rest they need Whales are thought to sleep around eight hours a day 

A single calf is born every two or three years Gestation takes up to a year Nursing continues for more than a year in many species there is a strong bond between mother and calf Reproductive maturity occurs at seven to ten years This mode of reproduction produces few offspring but increases their chance of surviving The effect of hunting is severe on these animals who replace their numbers so slowly

Whales are known to teach learn cooperate scheme and even grieve

Breaching is what happens when a whale jumps into the air and then purposefully flops down on the water with a great splash Sometimes it twirls in the air when it does this Scientists are not sure whether breaching is done to play to clean the whales skin of things that are stuck to it or to tell other whales something

There are a number of other behaviours on the surface which are not well understood Logging is when a whale swims slowly at the surface of the ocean with very little movement When a whale does this it looks like a log in the water Some scientists think this is a kind of rest or sleep for whales Spyhopping is when a whale sits straight up in the water with its head straight up and out of the water It will sometimes turn around in circles as it spyhops Some scientists think this might be because whales are trying to see what is happening above water Lobtailing is done when a whale faces downward in the water It then slaps the water with a thunderous sound Scientists think this might be done to warn other whales of danger or as a method of feeding

A marker is a writing device that allows a person to draw write or scribble Ink comes out of the tip of the marker and onto the writing surface commonly a piece of paper Markers generally come in a variety of different colors They are sometimes referred to as magic markers or magic pens

The tip of the marker where ink comes out from is usually made of cloth This allows the ink to go through easily A lot of ink can come out from it at one time

Anchors are used to stop boats from moving Today anchors are usually made of metal and they are made to catch the ocean floor

There are two main types of anchors temporary and permanent A permanent anchor is called a mooring block and is not easily moved A temporary anchor can be moved and is carried on the boat When people talk about anchors they are usually thinking about temporary anchors

An anchor works by either weight or shape Shape is more important to temporary anchors and design is very important Anchors must resist wind and tide and also the up and down movement of waves

The oldest anchors were just rocks and many rock anchors have been found from a long time ago Many modern moorings still use a large rock as the mooring block

A simple anchor which uses two arms made of wood and a rock weight is an anchor which is still used today The wood arms are sharp to enter the seabed and the weight will hold normal movement

The English language uses several special words to describe parts of anchors This is because England has a rich marine and naval history and so the language gives a large number of words to boat and ship terminology

A modern temporary anchor usually has a middle bar called the shank attached to a flat surface which holds the seabed The place where the shank meets the fluke is called the crown and the shank is usually fitted with a ring or shackle to attach it to the rode Some old anchors have attached to the shank a stock which is a bar that places the anchor in a certain way when it falls on the seabed Old anchors are often named stocked or stockless anchors depending on whether they have this or not

There are many designs

Over the last 20 years many new anchor designs have appeared These anchors are usually designed for small vessels and are usually not for large ships See modern designs

The Fisherman has a traditional design that has not changed much over time It is less useful than a good modern design and its holding power for its weight is among the worst of all anchor types

The most common brand of fluke anchors is the Danforth The Danforth style uses a stock at the crown to which two large flat flukes are attached The stock can rotate so the flukes can move toward the bottom It can hold very well but has difficulty setting on its own It is efficient for its weight

Fluke anchors have difficulty penetrating kelp and weed seabeds as well as very hard sand or clay seabeds Once set the anchor can come free and fail to reset on its own

A traditional design the grapnel style is simple to design and build It is a simple hook that is good for rock or reefs It is useless for most other seabeds

The original CQR was invented in 1933 in the United Kingdom Many copies of it now exist Plows used to be popular with sailors and private boaters They are good but not excellent in most seabeds Another more recent design is the Delta which is better

Plows use a special weight in the tip of the fluke for them to work properly This makes them heavy

The genuine CQR and Delta brands are now owned by Lewmar

The genuine Bruce was invented in the 1970s and to try to solve some problems of the plow Many copies are now made This type of anchor is now called a claw type Claw anchors can set quickly in some seabeds but do not hold well for their weight and can let go very suddenly

Bruce Anchor Group no longer make the genuine Bruce Most copies are lower quality than the genuine Bruce

Modern anchors are designed to be better than the plow and claw types Many are new still under patent and owned by commercial companies or tied to certain brands

Many modern designs are better than the older types This chart shows tests done by West Marine in 2006 The anchors were tested on three different sandy seabeds at three different scopes

Six of the seven best anchors on this chart are modern but several modern anchors did very badly This shows that newer is not always better 

Permanent anchors are used when a floating thing must be kept in place for a long time They are used to anchor Lightships navigation buoys and moorings The anchor must hold in all weather even the worst storm

A deadweight anchors is a heavy weight It can be used when the bottom is too hard for other types of anchors It can be made of a large rock or a concrete block

Mushroom and pyramid anchors are good where the seabed is soft This type of anchor needs time to dig into the seabed It can be smaller and lighter than a deadweight anchor The mushroom anchor is shaped like a mushroom and the pyramid anchor is shaped like a pyramid with the apex pointing down 

The sand screw must be screwed into the seabed before it is used It can be very light

Light pollution is a type of pollution It is defined as any adverse effect as a result of man made lights Usually this means too much light Several species including plants and humans are badly affected by light pollution Most people have never heard of light pollution and those who have usually dont care or do anything about it Light pollution costs Americans billions of dollars every year

There are five kinds of light pollution

Sky glow usually has more of an effect on the environment than light trespass and glare but all of them are a major problem to people today

Sky glow is the kind of light pollution that prevents people from seeing stars and other deep space objects This causes birds to not be able to migrate to the right place because they can not follow the moon and stars Sky glow also prevents astronomers from seeing dim objects

Light trespass is when light being used by a person goes into the property of another Though light trespass is not an environmental issue it is still light pollution

The third kind of light pollution glare has different kinds The first disability glare is the loss of visibility because of too many lights Discomfort glare is when the lights cause pain

Light pollution stops migrating birds of having any way of seeing the moon and starsthey use them to nagivate the direciton of their migrationtherefore not being able to migrate to the correct place Also sea turtles do not come to shore and nest as often because they are afraid of the lightsIt also affects animals eyes as a flash of camera weakens the eyesight of animals

Glare causes sleep problems in humans Too much light in an apartment shining in from a nearby billboard will disturb their sleep Also science is being affected by light pollution Astronomers have no way of observing or making discoveries with too much light to block the night sky It also causes headache as when light directly falls into our eyes and affects the sensory nerves

There are now several groups that are trying to prevent light pollution Light pollution first made news in 1964 when an observatory was specially placed just to avoid light pollution However it wasnt brought to the attention of most people until June 6 2002 when the Czech Republic passed the worlds first light pollution law Since then light pollution is slowly being recognized by the general public as a major problem

You can lower the amount of light pollution by having lights off when they are not needed You can also shield yourself from this pollution by putting curtains on a window facing the street or any other disturbing light source

So Paulo is the capital of the state of So Paulo Brazil It is the biggest city in the Southern Hemisphere 

The city has an area of 1523 km and more than 110 million people live there

In January 25 1554 two priests Manuel da Nbrega and Jos de Anchieta built a school  Colgio de So Paulo de Piratininga  to convert natives to Catholic religion Today this building is the Padre Anchieta Museum 

The first people moved to the region in 1560 when So Paulo became a village 

Because So Paulo was a poor village and was far away from the colony centre the bandeirantes chose it to start expeditions to enslave natives recapture runaway slaves and to find precious metals and stones 

In 1711 So Paulo became a city In the end of the 18th century people started growing sugarcane in the rural area of the province and So Paulo was the way to the port of Santos

In the 19th century after the construction of So Paulos Law School So Paulo became the capital of the province politicians and philosophers went there and the first newspapers and books were printed At this time many European immigrants especially Italians moved to So Paulo to work at the big coffee plantations 

At the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th century the city grew quickly Some people who study Brazilian History says the city was rebuilt

In the 20th century many factories were built and more immigrants moved to work there

Today So Paulo is a centre of commerce services and technology and some people consider it the most important South American city

The current mayor of So Paulo is Gilberto Kassab and his party is Democratas

So Paulo is crossed by the Tropic of Capricorn It is in a plateau 760 metres above the sea level 

Because of its altitude its climate is not so warm as it is near the coast So Paulo is 70 km far from the coast 420 km far from Rio de Janeiro and 1020 km far from Braslia the Brazilian capital city

The metropolitan area formed by So Paulo and 39 surroundings cities is the biggest in the Latin America More than 19 million people live in this metropolitan area which is also called Greater So Paulo and is the fifth biggest of the world

The city is divided into 31 boroughs and each borough is divided into neighbourhoods The boroughs form nine regions with similar geographic location and history but most people and companies prefer to use another division with only five regions

Descendants of many peoples live in So Paulo Italian Portuguese Spanish African German Lebanese Japanese There are also descendant of peoples from other South American countries for example Argentina and Bolivia and other places for example Chineses Jews and Koreans

Every day people from other cities or states move to So Paulo Many are people from the Northeast region of Brazil that try to find a job in the city

So Paulo is the commercial and industrial center of Brazil There are factories and shops of all sizes and kinds For example in So Paulo there are some of the more expensive shops of Brazil but also there are commercial districts formed only by cheap shops and people from many places buy clothing electronics and other products at these districts

Football is the sport with the biggest number of fans in the city The most important clubs from the city are Corinthians Palmeiras and So Paulo They are all playing in the Brazilian Srie A the major football championship in Brazil

There are also other big and medium teams from So Paulo for example Portuguesa and Juventus and many small teams However Santos FC that is a club from Santos a city in the coast is the fourth team in number of supporters

So Paulo also hosts the Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix in Autdromo Jos Carlos Pace

Other major sports are basketball and volleyball Some people also play handball tennis and other sports

Some people do not like So Paulo because of the big number of cars trucks and motorcycles on streets and avenues The public transport is also very important for the people who live there There are many bus lanes in the city and a big Metro and railway system

So Paulo has three airports and is the second city in number of helicopters of the world

Below is a list of famous people born in So Paulo

Tim Burton is an American artist and film maker He got his start as an animator for Walt Disney but soon moved on making his own kinds of films and projects He has an individual style the films that he makes are creative and often based on events that would not happen in real life For example the main character in Edward Scissorhands is a young man who has scissors instead of hands His films attract an audience usually that fits his unique tastes His films include

A DVD is an optical disc capable of storing up to 47 GB of data more than six times what a CD can hold DVDs are often used to store movies at better quality than a VHS DVDs can also have interactive menus and bonus features such as deleted scenes and commentaries Like CDs DVDs are read with a laser

The disc can have one or two sides and one or two layers of data per side the number of sides and layers determines how much it can hold A 12 cm diameter disc may have one of the following storage capacities

There are also 8 cm DVDs with a storage capacity of 15 GB

The capacity of a DVD ROM can be visually determined by noting the number of data sides and looking at the data side of the disc Double layered sides are usually gold colored while single layered sides are usually silver colored like a CD One additional way to tell if a DVD contains one or two layers is to look at the center ring on the underside of the disc If there are two barcodes it is a dual layer disc If there is one barcode there is only one layer

Both CD and DVD discs have equal sizes However the amount of information they can store is different These discs are made of the same materials and have the same methods of production

CDs and DVDs use the same way of keeping information Both CDs and DVDs have pits and bumps on the data track The information is read by a laser

A DVD disk has several layers which are made of plastic All layers have a thickness of 12 millimeters An injection used on a polycarbonate plastic leads to the creation of microscopic bumps Todays production uses this type of plastic to create different things because it can resist very high and low temperatures

When layers are made the bumps appear Many bumps form one continuous spiral that can include information After that a spray of a special reflective layer covers the bumps

Aluminum is applied behind inner layers and semi reflective gold covers the outer layers This helps the laser to concentrate through the outer layers onto the inner ones Then after applying a protective liquid and pressing the layers they are treated with infrared light

Every track on a DVD disk circles from its center to the edge The distance between the tracks on a DVD disk is 740 nanometers Only a very precise mechanism can read the bumps on the disk because they are very small The aluminum side of the disk has pits but the side which is read by the laser has bumps Because the size of the bumps are very small a DVD track is very long A data track of a DVD layer is about 75 miles long This is the length of an ordinary DVD disk The track of a disc with two sides would be about 30 miles long

A submarine is a vessel that goes under water Submarines are often war vessels but some are used for scientific or business purposes People with a lot of money can even buy their own small submarine to explore under the sea and look at fish A submarine is always called a boat not a ship

In early times submarines were often powered by hand as boat engines had not yet been invented They were almost always designed for war purposes and would attempt to sink enemy ships by crude methods like drilling screws into their wooden hulls Some attempted to blow ships up but this would often destroy the submarine as well

Later during the first and second world wars more practical submarines were developed mostly by Germany They were powered by a diesel electric system A diesel motor would be used to turn a generator which would charge a large number of batteries while the submarine was above the water This power was then used to power the submarine when it went underwater These submarines were dangerous for enemies and hard to see while under water but it was easy to attack them when they were above the water and recharging They were only used to attack ships

Most modern military submarines are powered by nuclear reactors These submarines often have a system which can get air from the surrounding seawater as well this combination allows them to stay under water until their food runs out Their most important functions are attacking ships or launching rockets like cruise missiles or nuclear missiles There are two kinds of these subs attack subs which are small and fast and attack other subs and surface ships with a special kind of underwater bomb called a torpedo and missiles subs which are larger and slower and designed mainly to shoot missiles at far away targets on land Missile subs are usually big enough that they can transport commandos and launch them safely from their torpedo tubes

The Mediterranean Sea is the body of water that separates Europe Africa and Asia

The Mediterranean Sea is connected to the Atlantic Ocean by a narrow passage called the Strait of Gibraltar It is between the southern tip of Spain and northern Morroco It is almost completely surrounded by land on the north by Europe on the south by North Africa and on the east by the Middle East It covers around 25 million km 

To the east it connects to the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea by the Dardanelles and the Bosporus The Sea of Marmara is often thought to be a part of the Mediterranean Sea whereas the Black Sea is generally not 

The 163 km long man made Suez Canal in the southeast connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea The canal is between Egypt and the Sinai peninsula It was built by the French Compagnie Universelle du Canal Maritime de Suez from 1859 to 1869 against the British governmentAs a sea around which some of the most ancient human civilizations were arranged

Some of the most ancient human civilisations were made around the Mediterranean Sea so it has had a large influence on the history and ways of life of these cultures It provided a way of trade colonization and war and was the basis of life for many communities throughout the ages The combination of similarly shared climate geology and access to a common sea has led to lots of historical and cultural connections between the ancient and modern societies around the Mediterranean

Above all it was the superhighway of transport in ancient times It allowed for trade and cultural exchange between peoples of the region Phoenicians Egyptians Carthaginians Greeks Romans and the Middle East cultures 

The history of the Mediterranean is important in understanding the origin and development of Western civilization In modern times the Mediterranean was the location of many battles at sea during World War II and control over it was important for defeating the Axis Powers Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy Today the Mediterranean Sea still connects the economies of Europe North Africa and the Middle East as it did in ancient times

Being nearly landlocked affects the Mediterranean Seas properties Tides are limited by the narrow connection with the Atlantic Ocean The water is saltier partly because of evaporation The Mediterranean has a deep blue color

Evaporation greatly exceeds precipitation and river runoff in the Mediterranean a fact that is central to the water circulation within the basinp202 Evaporation is especially high in its eastern half causing the water level to decrease and salinity to increase eastwardp206 This pressure gradient pushes relatively cool low salinity water from the Atlantic across the basin it warms and becomes saltier as it travels east then sinks in the region of the Levant and circulates westward to spill over the Strait of Gibraltarp2067 Thus seawater flow is eastward in the Straits surface waters and westward below once in the Atlantic this chemically distinct Mediterranean Intermediate Water can persist thousands of kilometers away from its sourcep207

The C programming language is a computer programming language that was developed to do system programming for the operating system UNIX C is an imperative programming language C was developed in the early 1970s by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie It is a procedural language which means that people can write their programs as a series of step by step instructions C is a compiled language 

Because the ideas behind C are kept close to the design of the computer the compiler can generate instructions for the computer that will run very fast This makes C a good language for writing operating systems Many operating systems including Linux and UNIX are programmed using this language The language itself has very few keywords and most things are done using libraries 

C is available for many different types of computers This is why C is called a portable language A program that is written in C and that respects certain limitations can be compiled for many different platforms 

The syntax of C has also influenced many other programming languages such as C C and Java

Here is an example of a program written in C When built and run it will show Hello world on the computer screen

A court in law is a part of the government that decides what laws mean when people disagree Some disagreements a court may decide are whether a person is guilty of a crime who is the legal owner of property or who the children of two divorced parents should live with A court is usually in a special building called a courthouse

Most countries have many courts that deal with different issues Some courts are higher and can change a decision made by a lower court

Pollution is something that causes some sort of damage or problem to the environment or atmosphere

Atmospheric pollution is due to harmful gases such ozonecarbon monoxidecarbon dioxide sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide and very small particles of carbon

Water pollution is the prsence in water of harmful material such as sewage dissolved metals waste from farms and factories and includes crude oil spilled from shipwrecked tankers 

The three main substances that pollute water are nitrates from fertilisers sewage and detergents

Pollution causes harm to living things in water and can also harm to peoples health and can problems such as cancer

The main sources of water pollution is from sewage farms and factories

The harmful noise in our environment such as the sound of cars in a city loud speakers etc is called noise pollution Noise pollution can cause ear problems or even permanent deafness especially to older people

Is too much artificial light at night which makes it difficult to see the stars and planets

Light pollution is an effect of modern civilization It is most severe in highly industrialized densely populated areas of North America Europe and Japan and in major cities in the Middle East and North Africa but even relatively small amounts of light can be noticed and create problems 

Immunity is the ability of the body to defend itself from foreign bodies This means rejecting infections clearing up dust which gets in the lungs and killing cancer cells Vaccination builds on the natural immune system to make a person resist certain diseases

Immunity is of two types Innate immunity protects the host against infection but has no memory and so gives no long term immunity 

The second type is adaptive immunity which does have a kind of memory It does give long term protection against specific pathogens

All animals plants and fungi have some innate immunity Vertebrates also have adaptive immunity 

People can be immunised from some diseases by having a vaccination By doing so the body learns how the virusbacteria harms the body and will react more quickly to fight the virusbacteria when it comes in contact with the virusbacteria again When your body has defended itself against the virusbacteria it will trap the certain virusbacteria in a net so when the virusbacteria comes back it will be easier to trap those virusesbacteria as well

Immunology is a science that examines the structure and function of the immune system It originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease 

The earliest known mention of immunity was during the plague of Athens in 430 BC Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time 

In the 18th century Pierre Louis de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom 

This and other observations of acquired immunity was later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease Pasteurs theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease such as the miasma theory 

It was not until Robert Kochs 1891 proofs for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905 that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901 with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by Walter Reed

Immunology made a great advance towards the end of the 19th century through rapid developments in the study of humoral immunity and cellular immunity 

Particularly important was the work of Paul Ehrlich who proposed the side chain theory to explain the specificity of the antigen antibody reaction his contributions to the understanding of humoral immunity were recognized by the award of a Nobel Prize in 1908 which was jointly awarded to the founder of cellular immunology Elie Mechnikov

The Inca were a civilization and an empire in western South America The word Inca can also mean the Emperor or Ruler of the Inca people The Inca are called a pre Columbian empire This means that their country was here before Christopher Columbus They ruled parts of South America around what is now Peru for a little over 100 years until the Spanish invasion in the 16th century

The Inca empire or Tawantinsuyo that in quechua means four regions only lasted for about 100 years as the arrival of the conquering Spaniards in 1532 marked the end of their reign Their main language was Quechua but as the Incas were basically made up of many different groups there were probably many different languages as well

Their capital was in the city of Cusco or Qosqo in what is now southern Peru They were ruled by an Emperor known as a Sapa Inca Throughout their empire they built many good roads to make travel easy 

A Roman numeral is the name for a number when it is written in the way the Romans used to write numbers Roman numerals are not used very often today in the west They are used to write the names of kings and queens or popes For example Queen Elizabeth II They may be used to write the year a book or movie was made

I  1

V  5

X  10

L  50

C  100

D  500

M  1000

If a lower value symbol is before a higher value one it is subtracted Otherwise it is added

So IV is 4 and VI is 6

For the numbers above X only the symbol right before it may be subtracted so 99 is XCIX

Numbers are written as Roman numerals in this way

I 1 

II 2 

III 3 

IV 4 

V 5

The System that is in use today is Whenever the same symbol is written four times it is replaced by subtracting it from the next higher number That way IV is written instead of IIII XL instead of XXXX etc 

Usually only one number is subtracted not two So 8 is always VIII and never IIX

Especially on clocks and watches IIII can sometimes still be found This is done partly because the IIII for the 4 oclock position aesthetically balances the VIII for the 8 oclock position

Proper form is to subtract only a value with the next lower power of 10 Thus 900 is written CM but 990 would not be XM  properly it is CM for the 900 portion and XC for the 90 portion or CMXC Similarly 999 would not be IM but rather CMXCIX  CM for the 900 portion XC for the 90 portion and IX for the 9 portion Only values with 1s are ever used to subtract 45 is properly XLV not VL

Notations in Roman numerals for numbers higher than 3001cn are rarely seen One system utilizes V and X with bars over them to signify 5000 and 10000 respectively

A map is an image of an area usually of the Earth or part of the Earth A map is different from an aerial photograph because it includes interpretation 

The word map can also be used to talk about a chart or drawing that shows relationships between ideas people events or anything else you can think about This is why web developers call a list of web pages on a web site a site map

People who make the maps are cartographers

Many maps today are made using GIS computer systems These are database systems that organized by things on a map instead of named records

If a map is on a piece of paper or a computer screen it has to be projected This is because the Earth is round and paper and screens are flat There are a lot of ways that use mathematics to make projections The only kind of map of the Earth that is not projected is one drawn on a sphere This is called a globe

A globe is a picture of a planet drawn on a sphere It is like a scale model of the planet The word globe comes from the Latin word globus meaning round mass or sphere

Most globes are maps of the Earth The most common types are political and physical Political globes show countries Physical globes show landscape like mountains and rivers

Global as an adjective is used to mean the entire world rather than any special place It is also used in fields like computers to mean across an entire hard drive network or any other operation

The fact that the Earth is a sphere was established by Hellenistic astronomy in the 3rd century BCE The earliest globe of the Earth appeared in that period The earliest known example is the one made by Crates of Mallus in Cilicia in the mid 2nd century BCE 

No globes of the Earth from Antiquity or the Middle Ages have survived An example of a surviving celestial globe is part of a Hellenistic sculpture called the Farnese Atlas It survives in a 2nd century AD Roman copy in the Naples Museum Naples Italy

Early globes of the Earth that show all of the Old World were constructed in the Islamic Golden Age One such example was made in the 9th century by Muslim geographers and cartographers working under the Abbasid caliph Al Mamun Another example was the globe introduced to Beijing by the Persian astronomer Jamal ad Din in 1267

The oldest surviving globe of the Earth is credited to Martin Behaim in Nrnberg Germany in 1492 A copy of the globe showing America was made by Martin Waldseemueller in 1507 Another early globe the Hunt Lenox Globe ca 1507 is thought to be the source of the phrase Here be dragons Another remarkably modern looking globe of the Earth was made by Taqi al Din at the Istanbul observatory of Taqi al Din during the 1570s

Mass produced globes are typically covered by a printed paper map The most common type has long thin gores of paper These strips narrow to a point at the North Pole and the South Pole Then a small disk is used to paper over the irregularities at the poles The more gores there are the less stretching and crumpling is needed to make the paper map fit the sphere From a geometric point of view all points on a sphere are the same One could select any point on the Earth and create a paper map that covers the Earth with strips that come together at that point and the antipodal point

A globe is usually mounted at a 235 angle on bearings This mounting represents the angle of the planet in relation to its sun and the spin of the planet This makes it easy to visualize how days and seasons change

Noah is a religious figure in Judeo Christian and Islamic religious text The story of Noah and his ark is a very popular biblical story 

As described in the Book of Genesis Noah and his family kept believing in God in a time when most people were not Knowing this was true God told Noah he was going to flood the world so he could drown out evil He told Noah to build a boat called an Ark As the story goes Noah was to put himself his family and two of every kind of animal on it People laughed at Noah at first but soon they were killed by the flood The people on the ark stayed on the boat not only until the flood was over but until they reached land To find land Noah had sent out a dove which returned with an olive branch This showed that they were close to land After the flood God made a rainbow to say he would never do something like the flood again to Earth

In actuality Noah was to put six of each of the animals deemed clean by the bible and two of each of the unclean The additional five of each animal were there so that Noah and his family would have food during the flood

A composer is someone who writes music Some composers work by writing music down on paper this is called written notation Classical music writers work this way Writers for TV and movie music also usually write this way so that an orchestra or other players can read the music and play it

Some musicians are very good at improvisation This means that they think up the music as they play it Some church organists are good at improvising During a service they may need to play some organ music to fill in the gaps while people are collecting money or taking communion Jazz musicians are usually excellent at improvising Improvisation is not written down so each time it is different

Popular and rock or soul music writers are often not able to read and write music down Many pop and rock composers compose their songs on a guitar or piano Cole Porter and Irving Berlin usually composed at the piano

Many songs are written by two or more people It is common for two people to work together to write songs Sometimes one person writes the music and one writes the words Some songs such as folk songs were composed many years ago and no one knows who wrote them

Henry VIII was the King of England from 1509 until his death He is best remembered for splitting with the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church and for having married six wives in succession

Henry was born in Greenwich Palace on 28 June 1491 and was the second son of Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York He had one brother who was called Arthur Prince of Wales and two sisters who were called Margaret and Mary Arthur should have been king after their father died but Arthur died before his father making Henry next in line for the throne Henry ended up marrying Arthurs widow Catherine of Aragon

Henry VIII was born in 18 June 1491 in Greenwich Henry VII and Elizabeth of York were loving parents although they saw little of their children Henry was their second son He had his own servants and minstrels and a fool named John Goose He even had a whipping boy who was punished for Henry when he did something wrong Prince Henry enjoyed music and was very good at it At the age of 10 he could play many instruments including the fife harp viola and drums Henry VIII was also a scholar linguist musician and athlete at his early age He could speak fluent Latin French and Spanish He got tutored by the best tutors and he also had to learn jousting archery hunting and other military arts Young Henry was very religious Henrys older brother was called Arthur Arthur married a Spanish princess Catalina de Aragon when he was fifteen Prince Arthur died within a few months of his wedding of tuberculosis at the age of 15 but some say he died of plague or sweating sickness

After his brother died Henry VIII bonded closely with Catalina de Aragon Later on they got married The couple had a bit of trouble getting married because it states in the book of Leviticus 21 If a brother is to marry the wife of a brother they will remain childless That meant that Catherine had to swear that her marriage with Arthur had not been perfect

Young Henry VIII was now the heir to the throne While his father was alive he was watched so closely because the King feared for the safety of his only remaining male heir Henry could go out only through a private door and then he was under the supervision of specially appointed people No one could speak to Henry He spent most of his time in his room which could only be entered through his fathers bedroom Henry never spoke in public unless it was to answer a question from his father He kept his enthusiastic personality under control on public occasions because he feared his fathers temper He received little training for his future role as King by his father and relied heavily on his counselors in the early years of his reign In 1509 Henry VII died of tuberculosis as well and his son became King Henry VIII He was 18 when he was crowned king and Catherine was crowened queen

The most important event that happened in England when Henry was the king was the countrys change in religion Because his first wife Catherine of Aragon had only had one daughter and they did not have any sons to be his heirs Henry asked the Pope to give them a divorce The Pope would not do this Catherines nephew was Charles V Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and he was very powerful Also Catherines family ruled Spain which was the largest Catholic country Henry then chose a new Archbishop of Canterbury a man called Thomas Cranmer Henry knew that Cranmer would do what he wanted and Cranmer agreed that Henry could have a divorce from Catherine The Pope was so angry that he excommunicated Henry meaning Henry was thrown out of the church Henry fought back In 1534 he passed the Act of Supremacy which meant that the king not the pope was the head of the church in England He then forced all priests and bishops to accept him as the new leader Anyone who refused was punished

Protestants thought that monasteries in which Roman Catholic monks and nuns lived had more money and land than the monks and nuns needed Henry forced the monks and nuns to move out of the monasteries Then Henry gave their money and land to men who supported him Most of the men who received money and land from the closed monasteries were Protestants This event was called the Dissolution of the monasteries

After his divorce from Catherine of Aragon Henry VIII married Anne Boleyn who was younger than Catherine and still able to have children When Anne just like Catherine only had a daughter and no sons Henry blamed her for being a witch and had her beheaded by a French swordsman and started looking for another wife Henrys most loyal official Thomas Cromwell helped him to find a way to get rid of Anne by finding people who said that she had been the lover of several other men Anne was put on trial and found guilty and she was executed by having her head chopped off

Henrys third wife was Jane Seymour She soon gave birth to a son called Edward This made Henry very happy but after a few days Jane died Henry had loved her very much and he never got over his sadness at her death He lost interest in everything and became very fat He became angry with Thomas Cromwell when Cromwell suggested that he should get married again after Janes death 

After a while Henry changed his mind Because he still only had one son he realised that it might be a good idea to marry again and he agreed to marry Anne of Cleves a German princess When Anne arrived Henry did not think she was as pretty as she looked in the pictures he had seen and he was not satisfied with her Anne was also unhappy and agreed to be divorced from Henry after only a few months In the meantime Henry had noticed a young lady at court called Catherine Howard and thought that she might make a good wife Catherine Howard was a cousin of Henrys second wife Anne Boleyn Henry and Catherine got married in 1540 but Catherine was much younger than Henry and she soon got tired of him and started to flirt with other men After they had been married for just over a year Henry found out that Catherine had been having an affair with someone else She was found guilty of treason and was executed just like Anne Boleyn had been a few years before

Henrys sixth and last wife was called Catherine Parr She was a woman in her thirties who had already been married twice Her first two husbands had been much older than she was and both had died Henry thought that she would be more sensible and faithful than his other wives and he turned out to be right Catherine Parr stayed married to Henry for over three years until he died but they did not have any children

After divorcing Catherine of Aragon Henry began to suffer many different ailments he never again regained health He died on 28 January 1547 and was buried in Windsor Castle Henry was the father of two queens and one king They were Mary I of England Elizabeth I of England and Edward VI of England None of them had any children of their own

An orchestra is a group of musicians playing instruments together They usually play classical music A large orchestra is sometimes called a symphony orchestra and a small orchestra is called a chamber orchestra A symphony orchestra may have about 100 players while a chamber orchestra may have 30 or 40 players The number of players will depend on what music they are playing and the size of the place where they are playing The word orchestra originally meant the semi circular space in front of a stage in a Greek theatre which is where the singers and instruments used to play Gradually the word came to mean the musicians themselves

The orchestra is directed by a conductor Heshe helps the players to play together to get the right balance so that everything can be heard clearly and to encourage the orchestra to play with the same kind of feeling Some small chamber orchestras may play without a conductor This was usual until the 19th century when the orchestras got very big and needed a conductor who made decisions and stood in front so that all the players could see him

The instruments of the orchestra are divided into families the strings woodwind brass and percussion Each section will have a player who is the section principal If the music says solo in their part it is the principal who will play the solo The principals will make decisions about seating arrangements and about technical ways of playing the music for example the principal of the string sections will make sure all the players move their bows up and down in the same direction The violins are divided into first and second violins The first violins usually have the tune while the seconds most of the time are part of the accompaniment The principal of the first violins is the leader of the orchestra In a professional orchestra they will be the most highly paid member of the orchestra

The strings are the biggest section although there are only four kinds of instruments violin viola cello and double bass This is because they are playing most of the time and usually form the basis of the music If they are not playing the tune they will probably be accompanying The first and second violins play different notes the firsts usually have the tune The strings sit at the front of the stage in a fan shape in front of the conductor The first violins are on the conductors left then come the second violins then the violas and then the cellos The double basses are behind the cellos Some conductors prefer to have the second violins on their right and the cellos between the first violins and violas

The woodwind sit in one or two rows behind the strings There are four main woodwind instruments flute oboe clarinet and bassoon Each of these four instruments also come in different versions 

The flute has a small version called the piccolo which plays an octave higher It is the highest instrument in the orchestra Occasionally there is an alto flute which is longer and plays a fifth lower than the flute Most woodwind instruments need a reed but the flute does not have a reed 

The oboe has a larger version called the cor anglais which sounds a fifth lower than the oboe It has a reed which fits into a curved crook

The clarinet has a larger version called the bass clarinet There is a smaller version the E flat clarinet There is also a clarinet larger than a normal clarinet but smaller than a bass clarinet the E flat alto clarinet 

The bassoon has a larger version the contrabassoon or double bassoon which sounds an octave lower It is the lowest instrument in the orchestra

A formal orchestra will always consist of two of the four main instruments The variations of the instruments are used where the piece asks for it Usually the newer pieces written after 1850 will have more instruments 

Sometimes a player will double on these extra instruments for example one of the flute players may also play the piccolo in the same piece It depends on the piece of music Obviously a player cannot play the flute and piccolo at the same time If the two instruments do play at the same time an extra player will be needed for the piccolo

The brass section has four sections trumpet trombone French horn and tuba Some of these come in several sizes The article on transposing instruments explains more about it The trumpet may have several slightly different sizes The lowest kind is a bass trumpet The trombone may be an alto tenor bass or contrabass trombone The French horn like the other brass instruments has changed over the years Modern horns have at least three valves and are usually in F They often sit in a different place to the other brass The tuba comes in different sizes and the player or conductor must decide which to use for the piece they are playing There are large ones called contrabass tubas A small tuba is commonly also seen and is called a euphonium or a baritone horn 

The percussion section has the largest variety of instruments but in an orchestra they will have the smallest number of players This is because they are mostly loud and can be heard easily over the rest of the orchestra The timpani can be tuned to particular notes They are the most common percussion instrument Composers such as Haydn and Mozart nearly always used them even with their small orchestras This is the most commonly used percussion instruments and is used in almost all pieces 

The rest of the percussion section can include tuned percussion instruments like xylophone glockenspiel vibraphone or marimba Non tuned percussion can be other kinds of drum like bass drum snare drum side drum and a variety of others tambourine cymbal castanets triangle woodblock claves to name the most common ones In an orchestral work there can be many percussion instruments but a few players The principal percussion player will have to decide which player will play which instrument The percussionists have to work well together as a team so all parts can be covered 

The piano is also used in an orchestra 

It is difficult to say when the orchestra was invented because instruments have played together for many centuries If we say that an orchestra is a group of string instruments with several players playing the same part and that there may be wind instruments or percussion playing as well then the 17th century is the time that orchestras started In Paris in 1626 King Louis XIII had an orchestra of 24 violins Later in the century the English king Charles II wanted to be like the French king and so he too had a string orchestra Gradually the other instruments were added At this time there was usually someone playing the harpsichord It was often the composer himself who would have conducted from the keyboard at important moments like the beginning and end of the piece

Clarinets came into the orchestra at the end of the 18th century and trombones at the beginning of the 19th century Orchestras were still quite small though The saxophone was invented in the middle of the 19th century but although they started to use it in orchestras it soon became an instrument that was used in wind bands and later jazz bands The opera composer Richard Wagner made the orchestra much bigger because he kept asking for extra instruments He asked for a bass clarinet in his opera Lohengrin and for his cycle of four operas called The Ring of the Nibelung he asked for an exact number of players 16 first violins 16 second violins 12 violas 12 cellos 8 double basses 3 flutes and piccolo 3 oboes and cor anglais 3 clarinets and bass clarinet 3 bassoons 3 trumpets and bass trumpet 3 tenor trombones and a double bass trombone 8 horns with 4 of them playing a specially designed tuba a bass tuba percussion and 6 harps

Not all pieces written after that need quite such a large orchestra but concert halls had become bigger and composers had got used to a bigger variety of sounds Later composers sometimes added all sorts of unusual instruments wind machine sandpaper block bottles typewriter anvils iron chains cuckoo Swannee whistle etc None of these are normal orchestral instruments Sometimes a piano is used in the percussion section eg Igor Stravinsky used one in Petrouchka Sometimes voices are also used

Today orchestras can usually be heard in concert halls They also play in opera houses for opera and ballet or in a large stadium for huge open air concerts Orchestras may record in studios for making CDs or recording music for movies Many of them can be heard easily and cheaply every summer in London at the BBC Proms

Some of the greatest orchestras today include the New York Philharmonic Orchestra the Boston Symphony Orchestra the Chicago Symphony Orchestra the Cleveland Orchestra the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra the London Symphony Orchestra the London Philharmonic Orchestra the BBC Symphony Orchestra the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra the Balmacewen School Orchestra the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra the St Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and the NHK Symphony Orchestra Opera houses usually have their own orchestra eg the orchestras of the Metropolitan Opera House La Scala or the Royal Opera House

In many countries there are opportunities for school age children who play instruments well to play in youth orchestras in their areas In Britain some of the very best are selected to play in the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain Other world famous youth orchestras include the Orquesta Sinfnica Simn Bolvar Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra the European Union Youth Orchestra and the West Eastern Divan Orchestra
