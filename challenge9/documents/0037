Marsupials are the main part of an infraclass of mammals called the Metatheria This consists of the marsupials and their extinct ancestors

Marsupials give birth to living babies and feed their babies on milk Their babies are born very small 

Marsupials have a special pouch where they carry their babies After the birth the baby goes into its mothers pouch where it can drink milk and is kept warm and safe When the babies are young they stay in the pouch all the time but when they are older they can leave it for short times When they are old enough and too big for the pouch they do not go into their mothers pouch anymore

Marsupials evolved before the southern supercontinent Gondwana broke off from Pangaea 100 million years ago Early marsupial fossils have been found in Asia from 125 million years ago 

They were outcompeted on Laurasia by placental mammals but the placentals did not get into the Australasian part of Gondwana before it broke away into a separate supercontinent That is why marsupials now found native only on the southern continents of Australasia and South and Central America with the single exception of the Virginia Opossum 

Some of the 100 living species of South American marsupials have migrated north 13 species to Central America and one to North America 

There are 334 species of living Australasian marsupials They are mostly in Australia and New Guinea and some are on the smaller islands

In more recent times the land bridge between the Americas and reintroductions to Australia have brought in placental mammals They have caused the recent extinction of many marsupial species

Telugu is an Indian language spoken in the southern part of India It is the official language of Andhra Pradesh It is one of the twenty two scheduled languages of the Republic of India Telugu is second most popular language spoken in India and 15th largest spoken language in the world As it is one of the oldest languages in the world the Government of India gave it the status of a Classical language

Aitereya Brahmanyam which is a part of Rigveda written thousands years before CE has mentioned Telugu Telugu also finds mention in Rajatarangini written by Bilhana Kavi As per Hindu mythology one of the sons of Bali Chakravarthy is Andhra or Andhrudu Telugu region ie Andhra or AP was ruled by him long before the times of Ramayana and Mahabharata

Telugu is the only language other than Sanskrit which has the linguistic prakriya called Avadhana which disappeared in other languages with the passage of time Languages also have become more and more simple and adopted simple pronunciations the reason for some typical sounds of Telugu being missing in many other languages

Sri Krishnadeva Raya has said Desa bhashalandu Telugu Lessa which means Among the nations languages Telugu is the best Rabindranath Tagore is said to have stated that Telugu is the sweetest language The famous Tamil poet Subramania Bharati also has sung thus Sundara Telunginil Pattisaithu which literally means Sing in beautiful Telugu

Being a mellifluous language British authors in the 19th century called Telugu Italian of the East It is believed that Italian explorer Niccol Da Conti who visited Vijayanagara empire during the reign of Vira Vijaya Bukka Raya in the fifteenth century coined the phrase 

According to linguists Proto Dravidian gave rise to 21 Dravidian languages They can be broadly classified into three groups Northern group Central group and Southern group of Dravidian languages The central group consists of ten languages out of which only Telugu became a civilized language and the rest of the nine languages remained tribal languages Telugu is the most widely spoken language of the Dravidian family which consists of 24 languages spanning all of South Asia from Baluchistan to Sri Lanka

In India the history of scripts has been almost independent of the history of languages The current similarity in scripts between Telugu and Kannada which falls under the southern group of Proto Dravidian languages along with Tamil Malayalam Tulu and others has a lot more to do with the rule of the Chalukyas than the similarity between the languages

Telugu is mainly spoken in the state of Andhra Pradesh and Yanam district of Puducherry as well as in the neighboring states of Tamil Nadu Puducherry Karnataka Maharashtra Orissa Chhattisgarh some parts of Jharkhand and West Bengal in India It is also spoken in the United States where the Telugu diaspora numbers more than a million as well as in Australia New Zealand Bahrain Canada Fiji Malaysia Singapore Mauritius Ireland South Africa the United Arab Emirates United Kingdom and many western European countries where there is also a considerable Telugu diaspora In Tamil Nadu about 63 of the population speak Telugu where it commonly known as Telungu

With 56 letters 16 vowels and 36 consonants Telugu has more letters in its alphabet than any other language There were letters for sounds Al Aluu which were later removed from the alphabet

Bacteria are very small organisms Almost all bacteria are so tiny they can only be seen through a microscope Bacteria are made up of one cell so they are a kind of unicellular organism They are among the simplest single celled organisms on Earth and were one of the earliest forms of life They include a number of extremophiles who live in extreme habitats

There are probably more individual bacteria than any other sort of organism on the planet Most bacteria live in the ground or in water but many live inside or on the skin of other organisms including humans There are about ten times as many bacterial cells as human cells in each of our bodies Some bacteria can cause diseases but others help us in everyday activities like digesting food Some even work for us in factories producing cheese and yogurt

A bacterium reproduces by dividing in half and creating two daughter cells Each daughter is identical in shape to the parent but smaller 

Bacteria do not have sexes but they do collect and transmit DNA by several kinds of horizontal gene transfer It is this which permits them to pass resistance to antibiotics from one strain to another The complete DNA sequence is known for many bacterial strains

Bacteria vary widely in size and shape but in general are at least ten times larger than viruses A typical bacterium is about 1 m in diameter so a thousand bacteria lined up would be one millimeter long There are about five nonillion bacteria on Earth

Bacteria are identified and grouped by their shapes The bacilli are rod shaped the cocci are ball shaped and the spirilla are spiral shaped 

Pathogenic bacteria the harmful kind enter the human body from the air water or food Once inside these bacteria attach themselves to or invade specific cells in our respiratory system digestive tract or any open wound There they begin to reproduce and spread while using the human body as a source of their own nutrients and energy

Poker is a game which people play with a normal set of 52 cards  Poker is a gambling game which involves some luck but also some skill In poker players make bets against each other depending on the value of their poker hand Bets are usually made with plastic or ceramic discs called chips Bets may also be made with real money but chips are more often used because they are easier to handle and count At the end of the game players either swap their chips for money or the chips are counted to determine the order of winners

There are many different kinds of poker In draw poker each player is dealt five cards A player can decide to throw away a number of these cards and then take new cards to replace them 

In stud poker some of each players cards are laid on the table so that the other players can see them  In community card poker players share some of their cards in the center of the table

The history of poker is a matter of some debate The name of the game likely descended from the French poque which descended from the German pochen but it is not clear whether the origins of poker itself lie with the games bearing those names It closely resembles the Persian game of as nas and may have been taught to French settlers in New Orleans by Persian sailors It is commonly regarded as sharing ancestry with the Renaissance game of primero and the French brelan The English game brag clearly descended from brelan and incorporated bluffing It is quite possible that all of these earlier games influenced the development of poker as it exists now

English actor Joseph Crowell reported that the game was played in New Orleans in 1829 with a deck of 20 cards four players betting on which players hand was the most valuable Jonathan H Greens book An Exposure of the Arts and Miseries of Gambling described the spread of the game from there to the rest of the country by Mississippi riverboats on which gambling was a common pastime

Soon after this spread the full 52 card English deck was used and the flush was introduced During the American Civil War many additions were made including draw poker stud poker and the straight Further American developments followed such as the wild card lowball and split pot poker and community card poker games Spread of the game to other countries particularly in Asia is often attributed to the US military

The game and jargon of poker have become important parts of American culture and English culture Such phrases as ace in the hole beats me blue chip call the bluff cash in pass the buck poker face stack up up the ante when the chips are down wild card and others are used in everyday conversation even by those unaware of their origins at the poker table

Modern tournament play became popular in American casinos after the World Series of Poker began in 1970 It was also during that decade that the first serious strategy books appeared notably The Theory of Poker by David Sklansky Super System by Doyle Brunson and The Book of Tells by Mike Caro

Pokers popularity has experienced an unprecedented spike in recent years largely due to the introduction of online poker and the invention of the hole card camera which finally turned the game into a spectator sport Viewers can now follow the action and drama of the game and broadcasts of poker tournaments such as the World Series of Poker and the World Poker Tour have brought in huge audiences for cable and satellite TV distributors

The game of poker is played in hundreds of variations but the following overview of game play applies to most of them

Depending on the game rules one or more players may be required to place an initial amount of money into the pot before the cards are dealt These are called forced bets and come in three forms antes blinds and bring ins

Like most card games the dealer shuffles the deck of cards The deck is then cut and the appropriate number of cards are dealt face down to the players In a casino a house dealer handles the cards for each hand but a button is rotated among the players to determine the order of dealing and betting in certain games In a home game the right to deal the cards typically rotates among the players clockwise but a button may still be used

After the initial deal the first of what may be several betting rounds begins Between rounds the players hands develop in some way often by being dealt additional cards or replacing cards previously dealt During a round of betting there will always be a current bet amount which is the total amount of money bet in this round by the player who bet last in this round To keep better track of this it is conventional for players to not place their bets directly into the pot but rather place them in front of themselves toward the pot until the betting round is over When the round is over the bets are then gathered into the pot

After the first betting round is completed there may be more rounds in which more cards are dealt in various ways followed by further rounds of betting At any time during the first or subsequent betting rounds if one player makes a bet and all other players fold the deal ends immediately the single remaining player is awarded the pot no cards are shown no more rounds are dealt and the next deal begins This is what makes it possible to bluff

At the end of the last betting round if more than one player remains there is a showdown in which the players reveal their previously hidden cards and evaluate their hands The player with the best hand according to the poker variant being played wins the pot

The following are poker hands from best to worst

Oregon is a state in the United States Salem is the capital and Portland is the city with the most people Oregon was the 33rd state to join the United States in 1859

The state of Washington is to the north of Oregon and California and Nevada are to its south The state of Idaho is to the east and the Pacific Ocean is to the west

The Columbia River flows along most of the border with Washington The Snake River flows along much of the border with Idaho The highest mountain is Mount Hood part of the Cascade Range of mountains Another famous Cascade Mountain in Oregon is Mount Mazama better known as Crater Lake

Oregon was a long way from the United States of America which was east of the Mississippi in the 1830s and 1840s To get to Oregon many settlers had to cross the Great Plains which were empty except for a few forts and Indians Most people thought that it was impossible to farm there They called it the Great American Desert because crossing it was long and dangerous however thousands did anyway

Mountain men had found a pass way over the Rocky Mountains and they named it the South Past This path helped many wagons to reach the west coast In 1836 a missionary named Marcus Whitman crossed through the pass with his wife to Oregon This made proof that it was possible for others with women and families to go too and because of this suddenly Oregon became the place pioneers wanted to make a trip to

Most of the settlers that came by the Oregon Trail had a very difficult trip The Trail began in Missouri and they went in covered wagons They could only travel 100 miles in one week and so the whole trip would take half a year But still lots of pioneers traveled so much that it is still available to see the wagon ruts in some places today

Life on the trail was very hard for the pioneers Every day they would break up and camp travel all day and set up camp again Food was usually beans and coffee for every single days The travelers always searched for water wood for fires and something to catch and eat fresh But these were hard to find and so sometimes they got mad at each other and fought with fists and guns

The Trail was also dangerous Rivers would flood washing away people and other things Indians may attack oxen or horses could die and diseases and injuries would strike

By 1840 due to all the hard work of the pioneers there were thousands of Americans in Oregon Towns and farms had been set up But the British however only had a few hundred settlers in Oregon Because of this the Americans began to plan to take over the whole land

Many Americans wanted this as well They made up the slogan Fifty four Forty or Fight and wanted all of Oregon up to latitude 54 celcius forty or they would go to war with Britain to get it They were so eager to have Oregon all for themselves they supported James Polk as president because he claimed to have similar thoughts with them as well

However after President Polk was elected he began to be more sensible He did not want to wage war with Britain if it could be avoided The British also realized that the Americans would soon have enough settlers in Oregon to easily drive out the British defenders In 1846 the British offered to divide Oregon by giving most of the border between the USA and Canada President Polk accepted this and so now the Americans had power over Oregon as well as the other countries

There are a number of colleges and universities in Oregon The four year universities with the most students are Portland State University Oregon State University and the University of Oregon

Despite Catherines popularity she still had not produced a son She had a daughter Mary I of England Henrys want of a son meant that he wanted to divorce his wife Catherine of Aragon

At first Henry tried to convince Anne Boleyn to be his mistress in 1527 Anne refused so Henry decided to marry her Because divorce was not allowed in the Catholic faith he used the pretext that as Catherine had been married to his older and dead brother Arthur that it was an invalid marriage He claimed that was acting by his conscious and he would like nothing more than to be proved wrong He quoted a verse in Leviticus which states that a man may not marry his brothers wife and such a union would be without the blessing of God and fruitless and used this as his case It became referred to as the kings Secret Matter and a special court was held with Cardinal Wolsey leading it

An official from Rome was brought over and a trial was held The official stated that he could not come to a conclusion and the case would have to be referred to Rome for the Pope to make a decision The matter dragged on for quite some time as the Pope would not agree to a divorce

In 1532 Anne Boleyn became pregnant with the kings child She was married to Henry on January 25 1533 so that the baby could be a legitimate heir Henrys marriage to Catherine of Aragon was finally annulled in the following May by Archbishop Cranmer thus ending the first of Henrys 6 marriages The divorce went against the Roman Catholic belief system so Henry created his own church The Church of England the beginnings of Protestantism with the King as the head instead of the Pope

Until the end of Catherines life Catherine believed that she was the true wife of Henry VIII Her servants called her their queen but Henry called her Dowager Princess of Wales

In 1535 Catherine was transferred to Kimbolton Castle and was not allowed to see her daughter Mary Henry VIII told her that if they declared Anne their queen they would be able to see each other Catherine nor Mary ever did Catherine died most likely of cancer in January of 1536 just five months before the execution of Anne Boleyn

The word Karnataka has been derived from two words ie karu and nadu meaning elevated land Evidences from the pre historic ages indicate that the culture of Karnataka had much in common with the civilization of Africa and is quite distinct from the pre historic culture of North India 

The Ashokas rock edicts found at some places in the state have revealed that major parts of Northern Karnataka were under the Mauryas Chandragupta Maurya the great Indian emperor abdicated the throne and embraced Jainism at Shravanabelagola a site in present Karnataka

In theory absolute zero is the temperature where the particles of matter stop moving Absolute zero is impossible to achieve because all particles move even if it is just a small vibration Some people have gotten very close to absolute zero but the record temperature was 100 pK above absolute zero Even getting close to absolute zero is difficult because anything that touches an object being cooled near absolute zero would give heat to the objects Scientists use lasers to slow atoms when cooling objects to very low temperatures

The Kelvin and Rankine temperature scales are defined so that absolute zero is 0 kelvins or 0 degrees Rankine The Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are defined so that absolute zero is 27315 C or 45967 F

At this stage the pressure of the particles is zero If we plot a graph to it we can see that the temperature of the particles is zero The temperature cannot go down any further Also the particles cannot move in reverse either because as the movement of particles is vibration vibrating in reverse would be nothing but simply vibrating again The closer the temperature of an object gets to absolute zero the less resistive the material is to electricity therefore it will conduct electricity almost perfectly with no measurable resistance 

The Third Law of Thermodynamics says that nothing can ever have a temperature of absolute zero

The Second Law of Thermodynamics says that all engines that are powered by heat must release waste heat and cant be 100 efficient This is because the efficiency is 100 which only is 100 if the outside temperature is absolute zero which it cant be So an engine cant be 100 efficient but you can make its efficiency closer to 100 by making the inside temperature hotter andor the outside temperature colder

A vacuum is a place where there is no matter Sound cannot move in a vacuum Outer space is not a perfect vacuum because there is a very small number of particles there A vacuum cleaner is a device that cleans dirt from floors Sometimes it is just called a vacuum Vacuum chambers are also used in many physics experiments involving environments with no matter

Vacuum is needed for industrial production Vacuum pumps are used to pump air out of the chamber After the process is finished no air is in the chamber In the real world it is not possible to create 100 vacuum but the latest vacuum pumps are able to create 999999 vacuum For most industrial purposes vacuum is used vacuum up to 0001 Lower vacuum is mainly used for laboratory purposes

The Muppets are puppet characters created by Jim Henson The characters include Kermit the Frog and the cast of Sesame Street Jim Henson started work with the Muppets in the 1950s and continued until his death in 1990 The Muppets are currently owned by The Walt Disney Company The term muppet is trademarked and owned by The Walt Disney Company Puppets used in Sesame Street are still called muppets at times and have special permission to use that name from The Walt Disney Company

Jim Henson said the name muppet came from combining the words puppet and marionette but he also said that he just liked the way the word sounded There is no defined difference between a muppet and a puppet other than the link to Jim Henson Many of Jim Hensons muppets have large eyes round noses and large mouths that go from one end of the face to the other Muppets are often made out of foam with felt on top Puppeteers usually control the muppet with one hand in the head and the other hand controls the muppets arms Sometimes the arms have a stick that is used to move the hand and arm  this is called the arm rod Puppeteers hold the arm rod at one end and the other end touches the muppet hand Some muppets have hands that are gloves Puppeteers put their hands in the gloves of these muppets so the muppet can move its fingers For this reason most muppets appear to favor their left hands

King John of England was the son of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine 

He reigned as King of England from 6 April 1199 until his death He got to the throne as the younger brother of Richard I King John is also famous for his part in the Robin Hood stories where he plays one of Robins enemies

Popular culture suggests that many people did not like him but we do not know what ordinary people thought 

We do know that disputes arose between John and his barons and bishops Because of this the nobles forced him to sign the agreement called Magna Carta and this limited his power 

Johns reign was important but not successful from Englands point of view He tried several times to recover land in France which had been lost but did not succeed

As the youngest son of Henry II John could expect no inheritance His family life was tumultuous as his older brothers all became involved in rebellions against Henry His mother Eleanor was imprisoned by Henry in 1173 when John was about five years old

Gerald of Wales relates that King Henry had a curious painting in a chamber of Winchester Castle showing an eagle being attacked by three of its chicks while a fourth chick crouched waiting for its chance to strike When asked the meaning of this picture King Henry said

As a young man John already had a reputation for treachery He conspired sometimes with and sometimes against his elder brothers Henry Richard and Geoffrey In 1184 John and Richard both claimed that they were the rightful heir to Aquitaine one of many unfriendly encounters between the two

Richard was absent on the Third Crusade from 1190 to 1194 John attempted to overthrow William Longchamp the Bishop of Ely who was Richards designated chief justiciar This was one of the events which led later writers to cast John as the villain in the legend of Robin Hood

John was more popular than Longchamp in London In October 1191 the leading citizens of the city opened the gates to John while Longchamp was confined in the tower John promised the city the right to govern itself as a commune in return for recognition as Richards heir presumptive 

As he returned from the Crusade Richard was captured by Leopold V Duke of Austria and handed over to Henry VI the Holy Roman Emperor who held him for ransom Meanwhile John had joined forces with Philip Augustus King of France They sent a letter to Henry asking him to keep Richard away from England for as long as possible offering payment to keep Richard imprisoned Henry declined their offer and got his ransom from Eleanor of Aquitaine Richard was set free Upon the release John begged forgiveness from Richard who granted it and named him heir presumptive

On Richards death John was accepted in Normandy and England He was crowned king at Westminster on 27 May Ascension Day 

However Anjou Maine and Brittany declared for Arthur of Brittany son of his elder brother Geoffrey Arthur fought his uncle for the throne with the support of Philip II of France The conflict between Arthur and John had serious consequences for both Finally Philip recognised John over Arthur The price paid was Johns agreement to be Philips vassal in Normandy and Angevin

Nevertheless conflicts continued until in 1202 Philip declared all Johns French lands and territories except Gascony in the southwest forfeit and immediately occupied them Philip gave Arthur all the land he had taken from John except for Normandy and betrothed him to his daughter Marie

John now needed to fight to get back his land in France In 1203 John ordered all shipyards in England to provide at least one ship with the newly built Portsmouth Naval Base to provide several He made Portsmouth the new home of the navy By the end of 1204 John had 45 large ships available to him and from then on an average of four new ones every year He also created an Admiralty of four admirals responsible for various parts of the new navy During Johns reign major improvements were made in ship design He also created the first big transport ships John is sometimes credited with the founding of the modern Royal Navy 

As part of the war Arthur attempted to kidnap his own grandmother Eleanor of Aquitaine at Mirebeau but was defeated and captured by Johns forces Arthur was imprisoned first at Falaise and then at Rouen After this Arthurs fate remains unknown but it is believed that he was murdered by John Assuming that he was murdered Brittany and later Normandy rebelled against John John also imprisoned his niece Eleanor Through deeds such as these John acquired a reputation for ruthlessness

In 1203 John exempted the citizens and merchants of Bordeaux from the Grande Coutume which was the principal tax on their exports In exchange the regions of Bordeaux Bayonne and Dax pledged support against the French Crown The unblocked ports gave Gascon merchants open access to the English wine market for the first time The following year John granted the same exemptions to La Rochelle and Poitou

In June 1204 the fall of Rouen allowed Phillip to annex Normandy and also take parts of Anjou and Poitou

John needed money for his army but the loss of the French territories especially Normandy greatly reduced the state income A huge tax would be needed to reclaim these territories He imposed the first income tax raising the huge sum of 70000

When Archbishop of Canterbury Hubert Walter died on 13 July 1205 John became involved in a dispute with Pope Innocent III The Canterbury Cathedral Chapter claimed the sole right to elect Huberts successor and favoured Reginald a candidate out of their midst However both the English bishops and the King had an interest in the choice of successor to this powerful office The king wanted John de Gray one of his own men When their dispute could not be settled the Chapter secretly elected one of their members as Archbishop A second election imposed by John resulted in another nominee When they both appeared in the Vatican Innocent disavowed both elections and his candidate Stephen Langton was elected despite the objections of Johns observers John was supported in his position by the English barons and many of the English bishops and refused to accept Langton

John expelled the Canterbury Chapter in July 1207 to which the Pope reacted by placing an interdict on the kingdom John retaliated by closing down the churches He confiscated all church possessions but individual churches were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates After his excommunication John tightened these measures and he got plenty from the income of vacant sees and abbeys For example the church lost an estimated 100000 marks to the Crown in 1213 The Pope gave permission for some churches to hold Mass behind closed doors in 1209 In 1212 they allowed last rites to the dying While the interdict was a burden to many it did not result in rebellion against John

In November 1209 John was excommunicated and in February 1213 Innocent threatened stronger measures unless John submitted The papal terms for submission were accepted in the presence of the papal legate Pandulph in May 1213 in addition John offered to surrender the Kingdom of England to God and the Saints Peter and Paul for a feudal service of 1000 marks annually 700 for England and 300 for Ireland With this submission written in a document John gained the support of his papal overlord in his new dispute with the English barons

After settling his dispute with the papacy John turned his attentions back to France The European wars ended in defeat at the Battle of Bouvines in July 1214 which forced the king to accept an unfavourable peace with France

The heavy scutage levy for the failed campaign was the last straw and when John attempted to raise more in September 1214 many barons refused to pay The barons no longer believed that John was capable of regaining his lost lands

In May 1215 Robert Fitz Walter led forty barons to renounce homage to the king at Northampton The so called Army of God marched on London taking the capital as well as taking Lincoln and Exeter

John met their leaders and with their French and Scots allies at Runnymede near London on 15 June 1215 There they sealed the Great Charter called in Latin Magna Carta It established a council of 25 barons to see John kept to the clauses like protection from illegal imprisonment access to swift justice parliamentary assent for taxation and scutage limitations

Because he was forced to seal the charter John sought approval to break it from his overlord the Pope Denouncing it as not only shameful and demeaning but also illegal and unjust the Pope agreed This provoked the First Barons War The barons invited a French invasion by Prince Louis of France and Louis accepted the offer of the crown of England as a reward for his support

John travelled around the country to oppose the rebel forces and directed a two month siege of the rebel held Rochester Castle While a small force arrived in rebel held London in November the Scots under their king Alexander II invaded northern England By the end of December John was leading an murderous expedition in the north culminating with the sacking of Berwick upon Tweed 

The French retook Rochester and much of the south although the royalists held on to Windsor and Dover 

With the momentum swinging from John some of his generals including his half brother William Longespe 3rd Earl of Salisbury went to the rebel side By the end of the summer Louis held a third of the country and had the support of two third of the barons In September Alexander II travelled down to pay homage to Louis at Dover where the French pretender had being laying siege to Dover Castle

Retreating from the French invasion John took a safe route around the marshy area of The Wash to avoid the rebel held area of East Anglia His slow baggage train took a direct route across it and was lost to the incoming tide This dealt John a terrible blow which affected his health and state of mind Succumbing to dysentery and moving from place to place he died at Newark Castle He was buried in Worcester Cathedral

His nine year old son succeeded him and became King Henry III of England The barons switched their allegiance to the new king forcing Louis to give up his claim and sign the Treaty of Lambeth in 1217

King Johns reign began with military defeats he lost Normandy to Philip II of France in his first five years on the throne His reign ended with England torn by civil war and himself on the verge of being forced out of power In 1213 he made England a papal fief to resolve a conflict with the Catholic Church and his rebellious barons forced him to seal Magna Carta in 1215 the act for which he is best remembered

John is responsible for the creation of another English cultural icon the historic medieval London Bridge To finance the construction of a large bridge across the Thames King John allowed houses shops and a church to be built on top of the bridge

John was an efficient ruler but he lost approval of the barons by taxing them in ways outside those traditionally allowed by feudal overlords The tax known as scutage became particularly unpopular John was a fair minded and well informed king however He often sat as a judge in the Royal Courts and his justice was much sought after Also Johns employment of an able Chancellor and clerks resulted in the first proper set of records 

Winston Churchill summarised the legacy of Johns reign When the long tally is added it will be seen that the British nation and the English speaking world owe far more to the vices of John than to the labours of virtuous sovereigns Medieval historian C Warren Hollister called John an enigmatic figure

In 1189 John was married to Isabel of Gloucester They had no children John had their marriage annulled and she was never acknowledged as queen John remarried on 24 August 1200 Isabella of Angoulme who was twenty years his junior John had kidnapped her from her fianc Hugh X of Lusignan

Isabella bore five children

John had many illegitimate children Matthew Paris accuses him of seducing the more attractive daughters and sisters of his barons and relatives John had these illegitimate children

Connecticut is a state in the United States Its capital is Hartford and its largest city is Bridgeport Connecticut became a state in 1636 Connecticut is a state in New England Connecticut does not have many natural resources so the people had to make things to make money

Connecticut is bordered on the south by Long Island Sound on the west by New York State on the north by Massachusetts and on the east by Rhode Island The state capital is Hartford and the other major cities include New Haven New London New Britain Norwich Milford Norwalk Stamford Waterbury Danbury and Bridgeport In all there are a total of 169 towns in Connecticut There is an ongoing civic pride and economic competition between Hartford and New Haven which stems back to the days when the two cities shared the states capital and even back to the rivalry between New Haven Colony and Connecticut Colony

The highest peak in Connecticut is Bear Mountain in Salisbury in the northwest corner of the state The highest point is just east of where Connecticut Massachusetts and New York meet on the southern slope of Mount Frissell whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts 3 The Connecticut River cuts through the center of the state flowing into Long Island Sound Connecticuts outlet to the Atlantic Ocean Further information List of Connecticut rivers

The state although small has regional variations in its landscape and culture from the wealthy estates of Fairfield Countys Gold Coast to the rolling mountains and horse farms of the Litchfield Hills of northwestern Connecticut Connecticuts rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New Haven then northwards to Hartford as well as further up the coast near New London Many towns center around a small park known as a green Near the green may stand a small white church a town meeting hall a tavern and several colonial houses Forests rivers lakes waterfalls and a sandy shore add to the states beauty

The northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the distinctive Southwick JogGranby Notch an approximately 25 mile square detour into Connecticut slightly west of the center of the border Somewhat surprisingly the actual origin of this anomaly is not absolutely certain with stories ranging from surveyors who were drunk attempting to avoid hostile Native Americans or taking a shortcut up the Connecticut River Massachusetts residents attempting to avoid Massachusetts high taxes for the low taxes of Connecticut Massachusetts interest in the resources represented by the Congamond Lakes which lie on the border of the jog and the need to compensate Massachusetts for an amount of land given to Connecticut due to inaccurate survey work4 5 6 Perhaps the only suggested reason which can be safely ruled out is that the jog is necessary to prevent Massachusetts from sliding out into the Atlantic Ocean In any event the dispute over the border retarded the development of the region since neither state would invest in even such basic amenities as schools for the area until the dispute had been settled

The southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a panhandle in Fairfield County containing Greenwich Stamford Fairfield Westport Wilton and Darien housing some of the wealthiest residents in the world This irregularity in the boundary is the result of territorial disputes in the late 1600s culminating with New York giving up its claim to this area whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from Ridgefield Connecticut to the Massachusetts border as well as undisputed claim to Rye New York7

Areas maintained by the National Park Service include Appalachian National Scenic Trail Quinebaug Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor and Weir Farm National Historic Site

The name Connecticut comes from the Mohegan Indian word Quinnehtukqut It means Long River Place or Beside the Long Tidal River The first explorer from Europe to come to Connecticut was Adriaen Block from the Netherlands After he explored this region in 1614 Dutch fur traders sailed up the Connecticut River and built a fort near present day Hartford which they called House of Hope The first English settlers came in 1633 They were Puritans from Massachusetts led by the Puritan reverend Thomas Hooker They founded the Connecticut Colony Colonies were also established at Old Saybrook and New Haven which later became part of Connecticut Historically important colonial settlements included Windsor Wethersfield Saybrook Hartford New Haven and New London Because the Dutch were outnumbered by the English settlers they left their fort in 1654 Its first constitution the Fundamental Orders was adopted on January 14 1639 while its current constitution the third for Connecticut was adopted in 1965 Connecticut is the fifth of the original thirteen states The western boundaries of Connecticut have been subject to change over time According to a 1650 agreement with the Dutch the western boundary of Connecticut ran north from the west side of Greenwich Bay provided the said line come not within 10 miles 16 km of Hudson River On the other hand Connecticuts original Charter in 1662 granted it all the land to the South Sea ie the Pacific Ocean This probably added confusion to the early forefathers because the Pacific Ocean is located on the west coast of the United States Agreements with New York the Pennamite Wars with Pennsylvania over Westmoreland County followed by Congressional intervention and the relinquishment and sale of the Western Reserve lands brought the state to its present boundaries

The Hobbit or There and Back Again is a book written by J R R Tolkien It was first published on September 21 1937 Tolkien wrote it in the 1930s for his children as a bedtime story The story takes place before The Lord of the Rings

The plot is about the hobbit Bilbo Baggins who goes on an adventurous quest with a group of dwarves and the wizard Gandalf in order to fight the dragon Smaug which has stolen the treasures and home of the dwarves

Although Tolkien borrowed from his own Middle earth storyline The Hobbit was at first not intended to be part of it Only later when Tolkien wrote The Lord of the Rings did he integrate the story of both Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings into his Middle earth world

The hobbit Bilbo Baggins lives a quiet and peaceful life One day the wizard Gandalf comes to him and with him thirteen dwarves Thorin Oakenshield Fli and Kli in Glin Balin Dwalin Dori Nori Ori Bifur Bofur and Bombur The dwarves tell their story A long time ago they lived in the Lonely Mountain Thorins father was their king the King under the Mountain But one day the dragon Smaug came to the Lonely Mountain and killed all of the dwarves he found The dragon took their treasure and now lives in the Lonely Mountain But some of the dwarves could flee Now the dwarves want to go back the Lonely Mountain and get back their home and treasures from the dragon Gandalf wants Bilbo to come with them and work as a master thief At first Bilbo does not want to but later he goes with them

Gandalf the dwarves and Bilbo start to go east on their journey to the Lonely Mountain After Gandalf saves the group from three trolls they find the trolls cave Among the trolls things there is some gold and swords Gandalf Thorin and Bilbo each get a sword The group continues on to the elven city Rivendell Its master Elrond gives them helpful information 

As the group travels east over the Misty Mountains they are attacked by Goblins The Goblins take the dwarves and Bilbo into their caves Gandalf saves them and the group flees During their flight Bilbo gets lost and tries to find a way out by himself In the tunnels Bilbo finds a ring which he puts in his pocket By an underground lake Bilbo meets the creature Gollum Gollum and Bilbo play a game of riddles If Bilbo wins the game Gollum will show him the way out if Gollum wins he will eat Bilbo When Bilbo does not know another riddle to ask Gollum he finds the ring in his pocket and asks himself What have I got in my pocket Gollum thinks this is a riddle but cannot answer it and so Bilbo wins the game Gollum is angry and does not want to help Bilbo Gollum then goes away to get something he owns a magical ring which turns the wearer invisible Gollum cannot find his ring and realizes that Bilbo has it Gollum goes back but Bilbo is afraid and runs away While running the ring slips on Bilbos finger and he becomes invisible Gollum runs past Bilbo towards the way out of the caves Bilbo realizes that the ring makes him invisible With the help of the ring he can follow Gollum and get out of the caves Outside Bilbo again meets Gandalf and the dwarves 

The group is attacked by Goblins and Wargs but saved by the Great Eagles The group comes to the home of Beorn a big man that can become a bear After staying at Beorns house they continue to the forest Mirkwood At the border of Mirkwood Gandalf leaves the group Bilbo and the dwarves have go through Mirkwood without him The dwarves are attacked and captured by giant spiders With the help of his ring and his sword Bilbo saves them Bilbo names his sword Sting The Wood Elves capture the dwarves Bilbo again uses the ring and saves the dwarves He frees them and puts them into barrels which he lets swim down a river out of Mirkwood The group comes to Lake town a human city near the Lonely Mountain 

The dwarves and Bilbo travel to the Lonely Mountain They can find the secret door into the mountain and open it Bilbo goes in two times and meets the dragon Smaug Bilbo steals a golden cup and finds out that Smaug has a vulnerable place on his left chest Bilbo tells this to the dwarves but a thrush also hears it Smaug is angry and goes out to destroy Lake town But in Laketown the thrush tells the archer Bard of the dragons weak point and Bard shoots the dragon A big part of Laketown is destroyed but Smaug is killed 

The dwarves are happy to be back in their old home and to have their old treasures back Thorin sends a message to the dwarves of his people and tells them to come But soon the people from Laketown and the Mirkwood Elves arrive Both peoples want a part of the treasure but the dwarves do not want to give them anything The humans and elves start a siege of the Lonely Mountain After a while the other dwarves of Thorins people come Din II Ironfoot and an army of dwarves 

The three armies almost start to fight each other but then the wizard Gandalf appears Gandalf tells them that an army of Goblins is coming to the Lonely Mountain and because of that the humans elves and dwarves have to fight the Goblins together The Battle of Five Armies is long and hard but is finally won with the help of the Great Eagles and Beorn Thorins nephews Fli and Kli are killed in the battle Thorin is wounded and dies afterwards Din becomes King under the Mountain Everyone gets a part of the dwarves treasure In the end Bilbo returns home and lives happily thereafter

The Hobbit has been adapted many times

The Lord of the Rings is a book written by J R R Tolkien It was first published in 1954 It is split in three parts which are named The Fellowship of the Ring The Two Towers and The Return of the King 

The Lord of the Rings takes place in Tolkiens fictional world called Middle earth Middle earth has its own geography several different races and peoples their languages and a history that is thousands of years old 

The plot of The Lord of the Rings is about the war of the peoples of Middle earth against a dark lord At the same time they try to destroy a ring which would give the dark lord a lot of power if he got it but the only place to destroy the ring is deep into the territory of the enemy 

The Lord of the Rings has also been made into several films the most well known is the film trilogy directed by Peter Jackson

The Lord of the Rings began as a sequel to Tolkiens earlier fantasy book The Hobbit but quickly became a much larger story He also moved its story into his fictional world Middle earth which he had already invented long before he wrote The Hobbit Tolkien wrote the story between 1937 and 1949 It was originally published in three parts in the years 1954 and 1955 Since then The Lord of the Rings has been translated into 38 languages It is one of the most popular stories in 20th century literature and has been an important book for the fantasy genre

The Lord of the Rings is often wrongly called a trilogy because the publisher split the book into three parts because of the books size Tolkien himself had sub divided the The Lord of the Rings into six parts called Book I VI according to the plot Tolkien never liked it being published in three parts or called a trilogy 

The backstory of The Lord of the Rings begins thousands of years before the action in the book

In the Second Age the Dark Lord Sauron wanted to rule Middle earth He disguised himself as Annatar the Lord of Gifts and pretended to be good As Annatar he told the elves how to make magical rings which give power to their wearers Sauron and the elves together made sixteen rings The Elves also made three rings by themselves called Vilya Nenya and Narya These nineteen rings were the Rings of Power But Sauron secretly forged a Great Ring of his own the One Ring In this Ring Sauron put half of his power He planned to control the wearers of the other rings with this One Ring But the Elves finally realized that Annatar really was the evil Sauron and hid the Rings of Power 

Sauron then started a war During this war he took back the sixteen rings which he had made together with the Elves Seven of these rings he gave to the kings of the dwarves and nine rings he gave to human kings These human kings became the Nazgl the Ringwraiths ghostly servants of Sauron 

Led by Gil galad and Elendil the Elves and the Men of Gondor and Arnor formed the Last Alliance of Men and Elves to fight Sauron There was a long war and siege of Saurons fortress Barad dr In the last battle Gil galad and Elendil were killed by Sauron After his fathers death Elendil son Isildur cut off the One Ring from Saurons hand Sauron was defeated and the war ended 

Because half of Saurons power was in the One Ring Sauron did not die fully His spirit still existed as long as the Ring existed The elves told Isildur to destroy the One Ring but Isildur did not want to and kept it 

The One Ring was lost when Isildur was attacked by Orcs Isildur tried to escape but he was killed when he lost the Ring In the Third Age the Ring was found by the Stoor hobbit Dagol who was killed by his friend Smagol over the Ring Smagol went to live under the Misty Mountains where he kept the Ring for five hundred years and he became known by the name Gollum 

In The Hobbit the Ring is found by the hobbit Bilbo Baggins He thinks it is an unimportant magic ring that simply makes its wearer invisible Bilbo keeps it and brings it back with him to the Shire at the end of his journey There the One Ring stayed until the beginning of the story of The Lord of the Rings

The book begins in the Third Age of Middle earth in the Shire the land of the hobbits Sixty years after his adventures in The Hobbit Bilbo Baggins is living in the Shire with his adopted cousin Frodo Baggins But Bilbo wants to make another long journey After a birthday party for his 111th birthday and Frodos 33rd birthday Bilbo leaves the Shire His home Bag End and the One Ring now belong to Frodo For another eighteen years nothing happens in Frodos life 

In April of the year 3018 the wizard Gandalf the Grey who is a friend of Bilbo and Frodo comes to Bag End He tells Frodo that his magic ring is really the One Ring of Sauron and tells him its backstory Sauron is returning and getting more powerful because he could not die while the Ring still existed Sauron is now also searching for the Ring Gandalf tells Frodo that he has to leave the Shire and take the One Ring to Rivendell an Elven city Samwise Gamgee Frodos gardener and servant will go with Frodo Gandalf promises to meet the two hobbits halfway in the town Bree Then Gandalf leaves 

Frodo and Sam prepare to leave the Shire in September 3018 On their way to leave the Shire they are already followed by Saurons Ringwraiths Frodos cousins Meriadoc Merry Brandybuck and Peregrin Pippin Took also come with them The four hobbits journey eastwards through the Old Forest and over the Barrow downs They come to Bree but Gandalf is not there They meet a man named Strider and they get a letter from Gandalf In the letter they are told to go with Strider who is really named Aragorn 

The hobbits continue their journey to Rivendell with Aragorn On the mountain Weathertop they are attacked by the Ringwraiths and Frodo is badly wounded by their leader the Witch king Aragorn can defend them and help Frodo to stay alive Along the way they meet the elf Glorfindel Shortly before Rivendell they are attacked again Frodo can flee on Glorfindels horse followed by the Ringwraiths Frodo crosses the river Bruinen beyond which is Rivendell but the Ringwraiths still follow him Suddenly the river floods which carries the Ringwraiths away Frodo falls unconscious because of the stab wound

Frodo wakes up in Rivendell He has been healed by the elven lord Elrond and Frodos friends are also well Gandalf is in Rivendell as are messengers from other peoples Frodo also meets Bilbo again who has lived in Rivendell for the past years 

The next day the Council of Elrond is held The messengers of the different peoples all tell the stories why they have come which are connected to Saurons doings Elrond tells them of Sauron and the One Ring Many other things are told and revealed Aragorn is the descendant of Isildur The wizard Saruman has betrayed the free peoples and turned to evil Also the One Ring cannot be used by anyone except Sauron The One Ring turns normal people invisible but it also corrupts them makes its wearer power hungry and the ring only does evil The Council decides that the One Ring has to be destroyed which will also truly kill Sauron forever But the One Ring can only be destroyed if it is thrown into the volcano Mount Doom in Saurons land Mordor where the One Ring was made The Council sends Frodo the Ring bearer to destroy the Ring and eight companions to help him These nine people are the Fellowship of the Ring the four hobbits Frodo Sam Merry and Pippin the elf Legolas the dwarf Gimli the two men Aragorn and Boromir and Gandalf the Grey 

At the beginning of the year 3019 the Fellowship begins their long journey Before they go Bilbo gives his sword Sting and his Mithril armour to Frodo With Gandalf as their leader the Fellowship first goes southwards through the land Hollin They try to go east over the Misty Mountains through the Redhorn Pass but there is too much snow The Fellowship decides to go under the mountains through the old Dwarven mines which are called Khazad dm or Moria They almost manage to go through Moria without anything happening but near the end they are attacked by Orcs There is also a Balrog a demonic evil creature from the First Age Gandalf protects the Fellowship but he and the Balrog fall into an abyss Aragorn leads the rest of the Fellowship out of Moria

Extinction is one of the major features of evolution A species is extinct when no members of the species are still alive 

All species become extinct sooner or later The end of a species may happen for many reasons It may be caused by habitat loss or by being overhunted or by a major extinction event An example of an animal that is now extinct is the Dodo from over hunting 

A species that is endangered has a good chance of becoming extinct Fossil species sometimes reappear millions of years after they were thought to be extinct These cases are called Lazarus taxa

The average duration of species varies according to the groups studied A study of benthic foraminifera showed an average of 16 million years if they lived above 200 metres but 25my if they lived below 200 metres On the other hand the average survival time for mammalian species over the past 20my has been 233my 

It is estimated that 999 of all species that have ever lived are now extinct More than half of the plants and animals that have become extinct in the last 200 years have been in Australia where the arrival of Europeans bringing accidentally or deliberately foreign species has damaged the native biota Especially the introduction of eutherian mammals has caused the extinction of many marsupial forms

Naturally higher categories such as genera families orders classes and phyla last longer because they are composed of more species As far as we know no phylum has gone completely extinct since the Cambrian but quite a few classes went extinct in one or other of the big five extinction events Examples of higher categories of animal now extinct are placoderm fish trilobites ammonites pelycosaurs dinosaurs pterosaurs ichthyosaurs plesiosaurs

Darwin thought that most extinctions occurred because some organisms became more effective and replaced their less advanced competitors No doubt that does occur But now we put more emphasis on environmental changes Organisms become adapted to the environments they live it The environment certainly does change and sometimes quite dramatically When it does some organisms can adapt to the changes and some cannot The ones that cannot become extinct That is all there is to it

The Earths environment can stay rather stable for long periods of time Then the rate of extinction is usually quite low Then changes occur sometimes quite rapidly In these times the rate of extinction can be much higher The rate of extinction is therefore a useful thing to measure

Mount Vesuvius is a stratovolcano on the Bay of Naples Italy It is about 9 kilometres east of Naples It is the only volcano on the mainland of Europe that erupted in the last 100 years though it does not erupt now Two other important active volcanoes in Italy are on islands They are Etna and Stromboli

Mount Vesuvius is best known for its eruption in AD 79 which destroyed the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum They were never built again The towns were buried so completely that people who lived there forgot about them until they were accidentally discovered again in the 18th century

The eruption also changed the way the Sarno River flowed and raised the sea beach Because of this Pompeii was not on the river nor next to the coast anymore Mount Vesuvius was also greatly changed Many of the plants there died and the top of the mountain looked different because of the strong eruption

Vesuvius has erupted many times after that Today it is one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world because 3000000 people live near this explosive volcano More people live near Mount Vesuvius than any other volcano in the world

Vesuvius has a long tradition of history and literature A serpent called Vesuvius has been used in frescos of many lararia from Pompeii In Capua the words IOVI VESVVIO show that he was worshipped as a power of Jupiter

The historian Diodorus Siculus said that there was a story that Hercules once passed through the country of Cumae when he was going to Sicily There he found a place called the Phlegraean Plain It said that it was from a hill which anciently vomited out fire now called Vesuvius Giant sons of the Earth lived inside it With the help of the gods he helped the people there and went on An ode by Martial in AD 88 suggests that Venus and Hercules were worshipped in the place that was destroyed by the eruption in AD 79

The volcano was often called Vesuvius in the late Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire It was also called Vesaevus Vesevus Vesbius and Vesvius Writers in ancient Greek called it or Many scholars think the word Vesuvius was related to the Greek word and so that it would mean unquenchable Others think it might come from hurl and violence hurling violence

Vesuvius has a large cone which is partly surrounded by the top of a caldera which was made when an earlier and much higher structure called Monte Somma collapsed The Gran Cono was made during the eruption of AD 79 For this reason the volcano is also called Somma Vesuvius or Somma Vesuvio

Before Mount Vesuvius exploded in 79 AD people who lived nearby did not even know that it was a volcano because it had not erupted for 600 years At about 1 PM on August 24 AD 79 Mount Vesuvius erupted violently It showered ash and pumice on the town of Pompeii which was 5 miles away

Today people think the eruption of 79 AD lasted more than 19 hours It was noticed by Pliny the Younger who described the mushroom cloud from the volcano as being in the shape of umbrella pine a tree commonly found in the region Pliny the Younger was the only person to write the story down

There were many ways that people died One was that the smoke that they breathed in was deadly because it dried in their lungs and formed glass They also were buried by powdery ash from the volcano which was all over them Over time this ash turned to a sort of rock protecting the bodies and the city from the weather and from robbers

Vesuvius erupted 50 more times after the eruption in 79 AD Vesuvius was named a national park in 1995

Mineralogy is the study of minerals Minerals are things that make rocks There are many different types of minerals Some are hard like diamonds Some are soft like talc Some are metal like gold or silver Minerals are put into special groups of minerals made of similar chemicals or that have similar structures inside For example the chemicals that make up some minerals line up in chains while in other minerals they make bow tie shapes 

Studying minerals can be useful for figuring out certain things about a rock Sometimes the shape or size of the mineral can tell something about the rock as well For example minerals in igneous rocks can help figure out how long the rock took to cool down Larger minerals mean the rock cooled slowly Smaller minerals mean the rock cooled down quickly The type of mineral in a rock can also tell what kind of a rock it is or what has happened to the rock since it formed Many rocks are named based on what kinds of minerals they have

Mineralogists study minerals in rocks with hand lenses and in thin section with microscopes They record things about the minerals like how big they are what shape they are what color they are and if the mineral changes colors when you turn it Mineralogists also record what color minerals turn in a special light These details can help mineralogists figure out what minerals they are looking at 

Minerals can be used in a lot of different things like jewelry farming pottery making metals and more Mineralogists can help find important minerals in the Earth using what they know and learn

Scientists believe that marijuana first grew somewhere in the Himalayas Evidence of smoking of marijuana goes as far back as prehistory where burnt hemp seeds were found at a burial site in present day Romania  The most famous users of cannabis were the ancient Hindus who called it ganjika in Sanskrit According to legend the Indian god Shiva told his followers to worship the plant The ancient drug soma was sometimes associated with marijuana People in the Persian Empire would light giant campfires made of marijuana exposing themselves and their neighbors to the smoke The ceremony was known as the booz rooz

Marijuana was also known in ancient Greece where magicians would burn its flowers in order to cause people strange thoughts The cult of Dionysus which is believed to have begun in ancient Greece is also believed to have involved inhaling marijuana smoke

When a person breathes in the marijuana smoke or eats it he or she may get a feeling called getting high or getting stoned The most common effects of the drug include feeling happy relaxed tired silly or scared having many ideas what to do or not being able to think clearly and getting hungry Smoking marijuana changes how people think and feel making it either harder or easier to solve some problems Some people who take marijuana feel strange or paranoid

When people smoke or eat cannabis they often get hungry because cannabis increases a persons appetite for food The slang term for this effect is the munchies Since hashish is much more concentrated than marijuana people who take large amounts of hashish may feel even stronger effects They may also hear strange sounds or have visions or thoughts called hallucinations Some hashish users like the feeling of these visions and thoughts while others may find them scary however hallucinations after smoking or eating cannabis are rare

Oats have many uses in food Most of the time they are rolled or crushed into oatmeal or ground into oat flour Oatmeal is also eaten as porridge but may also be used in many of baked goods such as oat cakes oatmeal cookies and oat bread Oats are also an substance used in many cold cereals in particular muesli and granola Without cooking oats may also be taken as food

Oats are also sometimes used in drinks In Britain it is used for making beer Oatmeal stout is one of many beers using some oats A cold sweet drink made of ground oats and milk is a well liked drink in Latin America Oatmeal caudle made of ale and oatmeal with spices was a usual British drink and well liked by Oliver Cromwell

In Scotland a dish called Sowans was made by putting the husks from oats in water for a week so that the fine dusty part of the meal remained at the bottom to be strained off boiled and taken as food Oats are also widely used there as a thickener in soups as barley or rice might be used in other countries

Oats are also commonly used as feed for horses  as whole or rolled oats or as part of food bits Cattle are also fed oats either whole or ground into a flour using a mill

Oat straw is prized by cattle and horse makers as bedding because its soft almost dust free and takes in liquid The straw can also be used for making corn dollies Tied in a cotton bag oat straw was used to soften bath water

Things take out of oatscan also be used to make pain less sharp in the skin as in skin lotions It is the main substance in the Aveeno line of products

Oats are mostly thought as healthy food The finding of the healthy cholesterol lowering properties has led to more liking of oats as human food

Oat is the only cereal having a globulin or legume like protein avenalin as the major storage protein Globulins can be taken up by weak salt water The more common cereal proteins are gluten and zein The minor protein of oat is avenin

Oat protein is almost the same in quality as soy bean protein which has been shown by the World Health Organization to be equal to meat milk and egg protein The amount of protein of the hull less oat kernel ranges from 1224 which is the highest among cereals

In 1948 Alfred Kinsey published the Kinsey scale The Kinsey scale shows that sexuality is a continuum meaning it moves little by little from homosexuality to heterosexuality On the Kinsey scale a 0 is someone who is only homosexual A 6 is someone who is only heterosexual Someone who is equally homosexual and heterosexual is a 3

Most bisexual people feel they are part of the LGBT community But some bisexual people do not feel they belong with lesbian and gay or straight people Some feel they should have a separate communityfactdateJuly 2010

Herodotus is called the Father of History for his writings about the ancient empires of Babylon Egypt and Persia and about the Ancient Greeks 

During his life Herodotus probably told his stories in front of large numbers of people in Greek cities He may have been paid money for thisfact He is now most famous for his writings about the wars between the Persian Empire and the Greek city states He told the story from the Greek side although the war was mostly finished when he was still a child

In his books Herodotus tells us that he travelled a lot He says that he went to what is now Italy the Ukraine Egypt and Sicily He may also have travelled to Babylon He often used stories from people he met to write about other places and happenings

Some people think that Herodotus wrote about things that were not true This is possible but it is also possible that he thought these things were true It may also be that he thought that these stories were interesting His work is important because he lived so long ago and there is very little writing on these subjects from this time

Harpsichords are keyboard instruments that produce sound by having the strings plucked with a plectrum They are thought to have originated when a keyboard was attached to a psaltery This makes them different from a clavichord where the strings are hit The piano is therefore closer to a clavichord than a harpsichord On a piano it is possible to play louder or quieter by playing the keys with more or less force On a harpsichord the volume cannot be controlled by the way it is played However some large harpsichords have several stops each one giving a different kind of sound The largest harpsichords have two manuals which gives more variety It makes it possible for the right hand to play the tune on one manual while the left hand plays an accompaniment more quietly on the other

Some small harpsichords like the one in Vermeers painting were called virginals perhaps because they were played by young girls There are also spinets which were very small and sometimes wing shaped They could be picked up and put on a table 

Harpsichords were very important in music from the Renaissance and Baroque periods They were used as solo instruments as well as to accompany an orchestra Some of the most famous composers of harpsichord music are William Byrd Franois Couperin Domenico Scarlatti and Johann Sebastian Bach

The Passion of the Christ is the title of a movie that was produced and directed by Mel Gibson based on sister Catherine Emmerichs visions It was released in 2004 The movie shows the last 24 hours in the life of Jesus of Nazareth as told in the Gospel accounts contained in the New Testament that Christians regard as a part of the Holy Bible

The Passion of the Christ was unusual and controversial for many reasons All of the speech was in three languages that were spoken at the time of Jesus Latin Greek and Hebrew The movie spent a lot of time showing details of the suffering and death of Jesus with lots of violent scenes Mel Gibson said that this was a realistic showing of what happened though others thought it showed too much violence

Jewish groups objected to the movie because it showed the Jewish leaders arranging to have Jesus killed They said that this would cause people to think that modern day Jews were guilty because of this and increase antisemitism however this did not happen The movie makers said that this was not their intention but this did not stop the objections

Mel Gibson was unable to get support from movie studios for this movie and so supplied the money for it mostly himself The movie made much more money than expected around 370 million

Depression can mean different things

Historically cavalry have been soldiers who fought while riding horses In modern times cavalry means the fast branch of the military as opposed to the slower infantry

Soldiers have fought on horses ever since people have ridden horses Because horses are strong cavalry members can wear more armour than infantry and carry heavier weapons Because horses are fast cavalry members can ride into battle more quickly than infantry members

Africa Eurasia is a supercontinent and the worlds biggest landmass Around 85 of the World population lives there It is split into two continents by the Suez Canal into the continents of Africa and Eurasia the latter of which has been historically further subdivided into Europe and Asia Historians of the cultural materialism school may subdivide it into Eurasia Northern Africa and Sub Saharan Africa based on different agricultural systems 

In geopolitics the mainland of Africa Eurasia has been referred to as the World Island

The Old World includes Africa Eurasia and its surrounding islands

In geological terms Africa Eurasia will be a supercontinent when Africa collides with Europe This is estimated to happen in 600000 years when the southern tip of Spain reaches Africa When this happens the Mediterranean Sea will be isolated from the Atlantic Ocean Africa is expected to collide with Europe completely in 50 million years closing the Mediterranean and creating new future mountain ranges which might be called the Mediterranean Mountains

Carbon dioxide is a chemical compound It is a gas at room temperature It is made of one carbon and two oxygen atoms People and animals release carbon dioxide when they breathe out Also every time something organic is burnt it makes carbon dioxide Plants use carbon dioxide to make food This process is called photosynthesis

Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas Greenhouse gases trap heat energy Greenhouse gases change the climate and weather on our planet Earth This is called climate change Some scientists think that greenhouse gases are causing global warming the rise of Earths surface temperature

Carbon dioxide is an end product in organisms that obtain energy from breaking down sugars fats and amino acids with oxygen as part of their metabolism This is a process known as cellular respiration This includes all plants animals many fungi and some bacteria In higher animals the carbon dioxide travels in the blood from the bodys tissues to the lungs where it is breathed out In plants using photosynthesis carbon dioxide is taken in from the atmosphere

Dry ice or solid carbon dioxide is the solid state of CO2 gas below 1093 F Dry ice does not occur naturally on earth but is man made It is colorless We can use dry ice for making drinks fizzy killing gophers and freezing warts The vapor of dry ice causes suffocation and eventually death Caution and professional assistance is recommended whenever dry ice is in use

It will not melt from a solid to a liquid but instead changes directly from a solid to a gas This is called sublimation It will change directly from a solid to a gas at any temperature higher than extremely cold temperatures Dry ice sublimes at normal air temperature Dry ice exposed to normal air gives off carbon dioxide gas that has no odor and no color

Carbon dioxide gas that comes off of dry ice is so cold that when it mixes with air it cools the water vapour in the air to fog which looks like a thick white smoke It is often used in the theater to create the appearance of fog or smoke

Chemists get carbon dioxide from cooling air They call this air distillation But this method is inefficient Chemists can also use several different chemical reactions to separate carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide is made in the reactions between most acids and most metal carbonates For example the reaction between hydrochloric acid and calcium carbonate makes carbon dioxide

The carbonic acid then decomposes to water and CO2 Such reactions cause foaming or bubbling or both In industry such reactions are used many times to neutralize waste acid streams

Quicklime a chemical that has widespread use can be made heating limestone to about 850 C This reaction also makes CO2

Carbon dioxide is also made in the combustion of all carbon containing fuels such as methane petroleum distillates coal or wood In most cases water is also released As an example the chemical reaction between methane and oxygen is

Carbon dioxide is made in steel mills Iron is reduced from its oxides with coke in a blast furnace producing pig iron and carbon dioxide

Yeast metabolizes sugar to produce carbon dioxide and ethanol also known as alcohol in the production of wines beers and other spirits but also in the production of bioethanol

All aerobic organisms produce chemCO2 when they oxidize carbohydrates fatty acids and proteins in the mitochondria of cells The large number of reactions involved are exceedingly complex and not described easily Photoautotrophs use another reaction Plants absorb chemCO2 from the air and together with water react it to form carbohydrates

Carbon dioxide is soluble in water in which it spontaneously interconverts between CO2 and chemH2CO3 The relative concentrations of chemCO2 H2CO3 and the deprotonated forms chemHCO3 and chemCO32 depend on the acidity In neutral or slightly alkaline water the bicarbonate form predominates becoming the most prevalent at the pH of seawater while in very alkaline water the predominant form is carbonate The bicarbonate and carbonate forms are very soluble So air equilibrated ocean water contains about 120 mg of bicarbonate per liter

Industrial carbon dioxide is produced mainly from six processes

An intermission or interval is a break in a performance An intermission may be twenty minutes or longer time for people to have a drink and time for the performers to relax Plays and operas are usually divided into acts The intermission will come where there is a suitable break between the acts There are a few operas which are so long that there may be two intermissions

 The Black Death was a pandemic that killed millions of people It started in Europe in 1347 and lasted until 1351 Almost one out of every three people in Europe got the disease and died This means about 25 million people died from it in Europe alone

As of 2008 people think the disease came from Europe Today it is believed the disease may have been the bubonic plague This disease is carried and spread by fleas on rats Traders from the Silk Road may have brought the infected fleas to Europe Another disease that could have been the Black Death is Anthrax Anthrax could have spread by cattle Looking at the quick spread of the disease Viral hemorrhagic fevers are other ideas for what specific disease the Black Death might have been 

Fleas started the problem The infected fleas were carried by black rats Rats infested with the diseased fleas would then carry them among human populations passing the fleas to human hosts When the fleas bit their host they would inject a little bit of the bacteria into the wound This would cause the human host to be infected by the bubonic plague Rats were regularly carried on ships This allowed the disease to spread through the Mediterranean

In humans the disease caused swelling in the broken wikt linkgroingroin and under the arms These swellings were often black in colour giving the disease its common name The dark swellings were called buboes People were in pain and then they died a horrible death The symptoms could be seen 3 7 days after being infected

It killed between a third and two thirds of Europes population Including in the Middle East India and China it killed at least 75 million people 

The same disease is thought to have returned to Europe every generation with different degrees of intensity and fatality until the 1700s Later outbreaks include the Italian Plague of 1629 1631 the Great Plague of London the Great Plague of Vienna the Great Plague of Marseille in 17201722 and the 1771 plague in Moscow There is some controversy over the identity of the disease but in its virulent form seems to have disappeared from Europe in the 18th century 

The Black Death had a very big effect on Europes population It changed Europes social structure It was a serious blow to the Roman Catholic Church and resulted in widespread persecution of minorities such as Jews Muslims foreigners beggars and lepers The uncertainty of daily survival influenced people to live for the moment as illustrated by Giovanni Boccaccio in The Decameron

The initial fourteenth century European event was called the Great Mortality by contemporary writers and with later outbreaks became known as the Black Death

The Black Death has been used as a subject or as a setting in modern literature and media Edgar Allan Poes short story The Masque of the Red Death is set in an unnamed country during a fictional plague that bears strong resemblance to the Black Death 

Albert Camus uses this theme too His novel The Plague is set against an outbreak of the plague in Algeria and how people handle it It was published in 1947 

Black Metal band 1349 are named after the year Black Death spread through Norway

Sufferers of the bubonic plague develop fevers severe flues and buboes that could swell to the size of an average apple These buboes appear mainly in the groin armpit and apparently sometimes on the thighs 

The medical knowledge of the time was based on Hippocrates theory According to Hippocrates the body consists of different fluids If they are in harmony the person is healthy If they are not disease results Very often diseases were also seen as a punishment of God Such a theory can of course not account for the spreading of a disease from one person to another one Spreading of disease was said to occur from bad winds The bad air could also come from within the earth and thereby cause the disease Remedies against the disease included to only open windows towards the north to not sleep during the day and not to work too hard The Faculty of Medicine of the University of Paris concluded that the Black Death was caused by a bad constellation of Jupiter Saturn and Mars This constellation had occurred on 20 March 1345 They had been asked by Philipp VI about the cause of the disease in 1348 Since the answer was scientifically founded it was soon taken to be the real cause and translated into many languages

Therefore the doctors often limited their actions to telling people to go to Confession so that their sins would be forgiven if they died In the long run the pandemics caused the doctors to change their ideas on how the human body worked to get away from the theories of Hyppocrates and Galenos more towards empirical science Only 200 years later did Girolamo Fracastoro discover that diseases spread through infection

Serfdom is a legal and economic system

A serf is a laborer who has to stay in one area Serfs were the lowest social class of the feudal society Serfs were different from slaves Serfs could have property In most serfdoms serfs were legally part of the land and if the land was sold they were sold with it 

Serfdom is the forced labour of serfs on the fields of the land owners Serfs got protection and the right to work on the leased fields Serfs worked in fields and other agricultural related works like forestry transportation work in craft and even in manufactures

Serfdom came from agricultural slavery of Roman Empire and spread through Europe around the 10th century Most people lived in serfdoms during the Middle Ages of Europe

In England serfdom lasted up to the 1600s in France until 1789 In most other European countries serfdom lasted until the early 19th century 

The word Serf came from the Latin servus meaning slave

All land was owned by landowners  nobility Church and monarchs A serf is any peasant who has to do manual labor for someone else in order to get to keep his land 

While most serfs were farmers some serfs were craftsman  like the village blacksmith miller or innkeeper

The serfs had a feudal contract just like a baron or a knight A serfs feudal contract was that he would live on and work a piece of land held by his Lord The serf would get protection in return

During that time people said that the a serf worked for all a knight or baron fought for all and a churchman prayed for all Everyone had his place and all was right with Gods world The serf did not have as good a position as the knights or barons but was better than slavery Serfs had some rights in the feudal contract

A manorial Lord could not sell his serfs like Romans can sell their slaves If his Lord sold some land the serf of that land went with it to serve their new Lord A serf could not leave his lands without permission A serf could not sell his lands

A free man usually became a serf because he owed a large debt He would make an agreement with the Lord of the land The Lord would keep him safe give money for his debt and give him land to work on and he would do work for the Lord All his children would become serfs

The usual serf paid his fees and taxes by working for the lord 3 or 4 days a week At different times in the year he would do different things A serf could plough his lords fields harvest crops dig ditches or repair fences The rest of his time he could take care of his own fields crops and animals 

The big problem for serfs was that he had to do the work for the Lord before he could do his own work When his Lords crops needed to be harvested his needed to be harvested too The Lord would give them very good food when they worked for him 

The serf also had to pay taxes and fees The Lord decided how much taxes they would pay from how much land the serf had usually 13 of their value They had to give money for fees when they got married had a baby or there was a war Money was not very common then so usually they paid by giving food instead of money

There were strange tests to decide if something was good enough to be given for taxes A chicken for example had to be able to jump over a fence That showed that the chicken was young and healthy

A serf had some freedom A serf could get and keep property and money Some serfs had more money and property than their free neighbors A serf could sometimes buy his freedom

Serfs could grow what they wanted on their lands Sometimes their taxes had to be paid in wheat which is very difficult to grow They took the wheat they did not give for taxes to the market Their heirs usually got an inheritance

The lord could not make the serfs leave his land unless he had good reasons The lord was supposed to protect them from criminals or other lords and he was supposed to give them charity during famines

The rules for serfdom were different at different times and places In some places serfdom changed into different types of taxation 

In different places and times serfs had to work different amounts In the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 13th century it was 2 3 days a year In the 14th century serfs had to work one day per week They had to work 4 days per week in the 17th century They had to work 6 days per week in the 18th century 

Sometimes serfs were soldiers during war They could get freedom or even ennoblement for bravery in war In other cases serfs could also purchase their freedom be manumitted by their enlightened or generous owners or flee to towns or newly settled land where few questions were asked Laws varied from country to country in England a serf who made his way to a chartered town and evaded recapture for a year and a day obtained his freedom

In many cases serfs had to get permission from their lord to marry someone who was not a serf for that lord

Sometimes a serf had to pay money because of something he had done This is called a fine A serf had to pay a fine when he inherited money or property He had to pay a fine if he became a priest or monk A serf had to pay a fine if his children went to the city instead of staying and being a serf Serfs had to give their best animal to their lord when they died so that their children would get to stay on the land 

A serfs had to pay to use the lords grain mill and bread oven They had to pay to use the lords carts to carry their produce The serfs were very angry about that Many peasants had to pay a fine because they used their own grain mill The miller charged a fee called which was usually 124 of the total grain milled The serfs often thought the millers were not honest Many lords made the serfs use the lords oven to bake their daily bread

Serfdom began to change because lords could make more money just renting the land Many Lords freed their serfs to get cash from their serfs instead of work from them 

Still the serfs lives were not seriously changed they still had to farm their land take care of their families and pay their taxes The main difference was that they could be forced off their lands if they did not pay the rent or if their Lord decided he wanted to use their fields for raising sheep rather than corn 

The lords took the best land for themselves Even though the serfs were free their life was harder

The helots in the ancient Greek city state of Sparta and the peasants working on government lands in ancient Rome worked like serfs but they did not use that name They were called coloni or tenant farmers The Germanic tribes took over the Roman Empire They took the lands from the wealthy Romans as the landlords but left the economic system of serfdom

The serfdom of medieval times began with the breakup of the Carolingian Empire around the 10th century This empire had ruled most of western Europe for more than 200 years It was followed by a long time when there were no strong central governments in most of Europe

During this time feudal lords worked to make serfdom the common way for people to live Serfdom was the system where great landlords could make sure other people worked to feed them and are forced legally and economically to keep doing that 

This system gave most of the agricultural labor during the Middle Ages There was slavery during the Middle Ages but it was not common Usually they were only slaves to take care of peoples houses Parts of Europe including much of Scandinavia never used serfdom or other feudal institutions 

In the later Middle Ages serfdom began to go away west of the Rhine even as it grew in Eastern Europe This was one important cause for the deep differences between the societies and economies of eastern and western Europe

In Western Europe the rise of powerful monarchs towns and an improving economy weakened the manorial system through the 13th and 14th centuries Serfdom was not common after the Renaissance 

Serfdom in Western Europe mostly ended in the 15th and 16th centuries This was because of changes in the economy population and laws about what lords could make their tenants do in Western European nations The end of serfdom in England around 1600 conincides approximately with the start of chattel slavery in the English speaking parts of the Western hemisphere

At the same time there were more protests by serfs and peasants like Tylers Rebellion in England in 1381 This put pressure on the nobility and the clergy to change the system and make it better The new ways of renting the land gave people more freedom

The Industrial Revolution helped end serfdoms Farmers wanted to move to towns to make more money than working in the fields Land owners also put their money into industries that made more money for them This caused urbanization

Serfdom reached Eastern European countries later than Western Europe It became the main way around the 15th century Before that time Eastern Europe had less people than Western Europe The lords of Eastern Europe tried to make people want to move there from Western Europe Serfdom developed in Eastern Europe after the Black Death epidemics That stopped the people moving to Eastern Europe and many people who were already there died

There was still serfdom in Russia until February 19 1861 In Russian Baltic provinces it ended in the beginning of 19th century Russian serfdom was different than in other Eastern European countries because it was not changed by German law and people coming from Germany The serfdom and manorialism systems were forced by the crown not the nobility

Some people say that planned economies especially those based on Soviet style Communist economics such as the Soviet collective farm system are government owned serfdom Friedrich Hayek said that in his book Road to Serfdom Mikhail Gorbachev believed that too In some Communist countries farmers were tied to their farms Some were called kolkhoz which were supposed to be collectives Some were called sovkhoz which were state owned The government used a system of internal passports and household registration to make people stay on their farms They had to plant crops according to instructions from the central authorities especially if they were on state run farms These authorities would then buy their agricultural produce at very low prices and use the money they made to invest in heavy industryfactdateApril 2009

This kind of serfdom lasted in Russia until 1974 USSR Government Decree 667 gave peasants identification documents with an unrestricted right to move within the country This was the first time in Russian history that had happened It is possible that a system like this still is happening in rural China

A refrigerator is a machine for keeping things cold It is sometimes called an icebox this word is used mainly by Americans or a fridge People put food and drinks in it to keep it cold or good for a longer time In general a refrigerator can be seen as a heat pump It takes heat away from the air inside the fridge The heat gets added to the air from outside For this it usually uses electricity

There are also ice boxes available that do not use electricity because they are filled with ice to provide the colder temperature The ice can keep things cold until the ice melts These ice boxes can taken on camping trips Sometimes they are called coolers Refrigerator sized iceboxes were used before electricity was available

Most modern refrigerators are available in a variety of colours although normally fridges are white as shown in the picture Smaller versions of the popular refrigerator are also used These are mainly used in Africa and go by the name of microfridgesfactdateJuly 2010

A fungus is a kind of living organism yeasts moulds and mushrooms are types of fungi The Fungi are a separate kingdom of living things different from animals and plants

Fungi have cells with nuclei Their cell walls contain chitin unlike the cell walls of plants which contain cellulose These and other differences show that the fungi form a single group of related organisms called the Eumycota or Eumycetes They share a common ancestor and are monophyletic group 

Their basic mode of life is saprophytic a fungus breaks down dead organic matter around it and uses it as foodp107

Fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually Some fungi grow mushrooms these are fruiting bodies Under the cap there are gills the gills bear spores that will disperse and may develop into new fungi Otherwise fungi use a sporangium to bear asexual spores by mitosis or sexual spores by meiosis The spores are haploid

Fungi may be single celled or multicellular Yeast is single celled and reproduces either sexually or asexually Asexual reproduction occurs by simple budding

The mycelial form of multi celled fungi is the vegetative growth of filaments called hyphae Mycelia are usually syncytia This means the cell septas are not complete and the cell nuclei are not separated from each other as in normal cells Details differ between species

Symbiosis means living together Lichens are a symbiosis between a fungus and an alga or bacterium In this partnership the algal cells live inside the fungus tissue The end result is a new mat like life form which clings to rock and other surfaces About 20 of all fungi are lichenized

Another important kind of symbiosis is mycorrhiza This is when a fungus lives inside plant roots most trees have mycorrhizal roots and so do many crop plants Both sides benefit in this arrangement

 Some fungi cause crop diseases others cause serious disease in humans Some are highly poisonous never eat a mushroom picked in the wild unless you know what you are doing

Pottery is a word with different meanings It can mean a ceramic object a ceramic material a place were ceramic objects are made For a long time ceramics have been used to produce useful things such as containers and tiles 

Pottery objects are made from clay mixed with other materials They are then fired in a special oven called a kiln at high temperatures The potter may then apply a glaze to the surface before firing the object again The glaze makes the surface of the pottery shiny decorative and water tight However some contemporary potters make objects which are not useful and are really 3D Design or sculpture

A screenwriter is a person who writes the screenplay for a movie or television show  that is a screenwriter writes the words that the actors and actresses speak 

A script conveys the dialogue of the movie and will briefly describe visuals although not too much as this is left up to the director 

There are certain rules as to how to format a movie script If these are not followed then it is highly unlikely that it will ever be taken seriously In order to test the effectiveness of a script actors will do a first reading of it If the format is not clear then it will probably cause the actors confusion and will make the task very difficult to complete

Alexander Scriabin was a famous Russian composer and pianist He wrote music for the orchestra and for the piano His music belongs to the Late Romantic period but his later works sound quite modern and he was influenced by Impressionism He had some very unusual ideas about combining all the arts into one work

Scriabin was the only child in a family which had an aristocratic background He was always proud of having been born on Christmas Day His mother died when he was a year old and his father spent most of his time abroad working as a diplomat He was looked after by his aunt grandmother and great aunt all of whom fussed over him so that he was a very spoilt child When he grew up he was very short and his hands could only just stretch one octave on the piano

Scriabin was educated in the Moscow Cadet Corps He learned to play the piano and became friends with the composer Sergei Rachmaninoff who was just one year younger He won the second gold medal ever to be awarded at the Moscow Conservatoire He practised a piece called Islamey by Balakirev but damaged his right hand doing it He still managed to continue his career as a pianist but he wrote a few piano pieces for the left hand only In 1895 he toured through many countries in Europe giving concerts and composing a lot of piano music He married in 1897 He went with his wife to Odessa where he played his Piano Concerto and then spent several months in Paris He taught at the Moscow Conservatoire and wrote some important orchestral music Later he left his wife and children and went to Europe for several years with another woman She inspired a lot of his music Scriabin continued to travel and play the piano until the end of his life When he was in London in 1914 he had a boil on his lip which got steadily worse until he died a year later

Scriabin liked the music of Chopin and he wrote a lot of short pieces called Preludes which show Chopins influence As he got older his music became more and more personal He was very egocentric and he had some strange ideas He wanted to write a work which combined all the arts and all the senses music dance poetry colours and even smells He wanted this work to be performed beside a lake in India This work was never finished or performed and we do not know whether he seriously thought it would happen but he did buy himself a sun helmet

Scriabin tried using different harmonies in his music He had a favourite chord which he called his mystic chord He used it in lots of ways His orchestral works include a Piano Concerto 3 symphonies Le pome de lextase and Promthe le pome du feu He liked the music of French Impressionist composers like Debussy and they influenced his music which is often mysterious and dream like

Oscar Wilde was an Irish writer poet and playwright He wrote The Picture of Dorian Gray and the plays Salom The Importance of Being Earnest An Ideal Husband and Lady Windermeres Fan 

Wilde was bisexual He was married and had two children His downfall came as a result of his affair with a younger man Lord Alfred Douglas

Wilde was an outstanding classical scholar at Trinity College Dublin then at Magdalen College Oxford University In London he worked as a journalist for four years Known for his biting wit flamboyant clothes and glittering conversation Wilde was one of the best known personalities of the day It was his only novel The Picture of Dorian Gray which brought him full recognition Then he turned to writing drama He wrote Salom in French in Paris in 1891 but it was refused a licence Unperturbed Wilde produced four society comedies in the early 1890s which made him one of the most successful playwrights of late Victorian London

At the height of his fame and successhis masterpiece The Importance of Being Earnest was still on stage in LondonWilde sued his lovers father for libel After a series of trials Wilde was convicted of gross indecency with other men and sentenced to two years of hard labour in Reading Gaol In prison he wrote De Profundis a long letter which discusses his spiritual journey through his trials forming a dark counterpoint to his earlier philosophy of pleasure 

Upon his release he left immediately for France never to return to the British Isles There he wrote his last work The Ballad of Reading Gaol a long poem commemorating prison life Living in a Paris hotel he was destitute with little money and few friends His last memorable words were My wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death One of us has got to gop546 He died of cerebral meningitis at the age of forty six

Wildes wife Constance Lloyd changed the family name to Holland after his conviction and took the children to Switzerland

Wildes lover was the son of the Marquess of Queensbury who was known for his outspoken atheism brutish manner and creation of the modern rules of boxing Queensberry who feuded regularly with his son confronted Wilde and Lord Alfred as to the nature of their relationship In June 1894 he called on Wilde at 16 Tite Street without an appointment and said If I catch you and my son again in any public restaurant I will thrash you

On the 18 February 1895 the Marquess left his calling card at Wildes club the Albemarle inscribed For Oscar Wilde posing as a sodomite

Wilde egged on by Douglas and against the advice of his friends initiated a private prosecution against Queensberry and had him arrested on a charge of criminal libel As sodomy was then a crime Queensberrys note amounted to a public accusation that Wilde had committed a felony forming the legal basis for libel charges Queensberry could avoid conviction for libel only by demonstrating that his accusation was in fact true

In his opening speech for the defence Counsel for Queensbury Edward Carson announced that he had found several male prostitutes who were to testify that they had sex with Wilde On the advice of his lawyers Wilde then decided to drop the libel prosecution against Queensberry Queensberry was found not guilty as the court declared that his accusation that Wilde was posing as a sodomite was justified true in substance and in fact

Under the Libel Act 1843 Queensberrys acquittal rendered Wilde legally liable for the considerable expenses Queensberry had incurred in his defence which left Wilde bankrupt

After Wilde left the court a warrant for his arrest was applied for on charges of sodomy and gross indecency Friends found Wilde at a hotel they advised him to go to Dover and try to get a boat to France His mother advised him to stay and fight like a man Wilde was duly arrested and then imprisoned on remand at Holloway where he received daily visits from Douglas

Events moved quickly His prosecution opened on the 26 April 1895 and Wilde pleaded not guilty He had already begged Douglas to leave London for Paris and Douglas fled to the Hotel du Monde Under cross examination Wilde was at first hesitant then spoke eloquently

Charles Gill What is the love that dare not speak its name Wilde The love that dare not speak its name in this century is such a great affection of an elder for a younger man as there was between David and Jonathan such as Plato made the very basis of his philosophy and such as you find in the sonnets of Michelangelo and Shakespeare It is that deep spiritual affection that is as pure as it is perfect It dictates and pervades great works of art like those of Shakespeare and Michelangelo and those two letters of mine such as they are It is in this century misunderstood so much misunderstood that it may be described as the love that dare not speak its name and on that account of it I am placed where I am now It is beautiful it is fine it is the noblest form of affection There is nothing unnatural about it It is intellectual and it repeatedly exists between an older and a younger man when the older man has intellect and the younger man has all the joy hope and glamour of life before him That it should be so the world does not understand The world mocks at it and sometimes puts one in the pillory for it 

This response was however counterproductive in a legal sense as it only served to reinforce the charges of homosexual behaviour The trial ended with the jury unable to reach a verdict Wildes counsel Sir Edward Clark was finally able to agree bail The Reverend Stewart Headlam put up most of the 5000 bail having disagreed with Wildes treatment by the press and the courts Wilde was freed from Holloway and shunning attention went into hiding at the house of Ernest and Ada Leverson two of his firm friends Edward Carson approached Frank Lockwood and asked Can we not let up on the fellow nowp435 Lockwood answered that he would like to do so but feared that the case had become too politicised to be dropped

At the final trial Wilde and Alfred Taylor were convicted of gross indecency and sentenced to two years hard labour The judge described the sentence as totally inadequate for a case such as this although it was the maximum sentence allowed for the charge under the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885 Wildes response And I May I say nothing my Lord was drowned out in cries of Shame in the courtroom

Herbert Clark Hoover the 31st president of the United States from 19291933 He was a world famous mining engineer and humanitarian administrator As a United States Commerce Secretary in the 1920s under Presidents Warren G Harding and Calvin Coolidge he promoted economic modernization In the presidential election of 1928 Hoover easily won the Republican nomination The nation was prosperous and optimistic leading to a landslide for Hoover over the Democrat Al Smith

A few months after the United States had at its strongest economy in all of its history the stock market crashed and the Great Depression was beginning 

Unlike Andrew Mellon and Calvin Coolidge who believed that the federal government should keep its hands off the economy Herbert Hoover believed that some action from the federal government is necessary

While he opposed a welfare state which would give money to people for doing nothing he wanted to create jobs through several government programs including the construction of a huge dam which would be later named Hoover Dam 

The federal government received less money in tax revenues because of the bad economy and the government was spending more money than it was taking in so Hoover tried to increase the governments revenue to balance the budget He signed the Revenue Act of 1932 which was a large tax increase He signed the largest tariff increase in American history which worsened the Great Depression even though 1000 economists warned him not to sign that 

Hoover denied giving promised retirement money to poor World War 1 veterans earlier than what was agreed to so they went on strike Hoover ordered the United States army to force them to leave It resulted in a bloody conflict which hurt Hoovers reputation 

Hoover was uncharismatic and did not relate to the people well which made many people consider him as mean spirited 

Hoover supported the very unpopular prohibition of alcohol and did not want to make alcohol legal 

While Hoover did support some government involvement in the economy he was against Franklin Roosevelts New Deal because he thought it called for too much government involvement in the economy

Due to his failure to cure the Great Depression he lost the 1932 election to Franklin Roosevelt

The Julian calendar is a calendar that was invented by Julius Caesar the leader of Ancient Rome It is a reform of the Roman calendar It was first used in the year 709 Ab urbe condita or 45 BC Caesar consulted the astronomer Sosigenes of Alexandria Very probably it was made to approximate the tropical year which was known at least since Hipparchus 

The calendar has a regular year of 365 days divided into 12 months and a leap day is added every four years to the month of February making the average Julian year 36525 days 

In the 16th century the Gregorian calendar was introduced in Europe because it was more accurate with regard to the length of the year and it also moved the date for the vernal equinox the first day of spring to where it belonged again on March 21 The Gregorian calendar has 97 leap days every 400 years while the Julian had exactly 100 

Some countries used this calendar to the 20th century Mount Athos and many national Eastern Orthodox churches still use the Julian calendar or a revised form introduced in 1923 

The main problem with the Julian Calendar is that it makes too many leap days which means that it gains a day about every 128 years 

People sometimes use the term Old Style or OS to refer to the Julian calendar with NS or New Style referring to the Gregorian calendar

The Gregorian calendar is the calendar that is used throughout most of the Western world It began to be used from 1582 It replaced the previous Julian calendar because the Julian Calendar had an error it added a leap year with no exceptions The length of the Julian year was exactly 36525 days but the actual time it takes for the Earth to go around the Sun once is closer to 3652425 days This difference is about eleven minutes each year

This made the seasons get out of track since the real first day of spring in western Europe was happening earlier and earlier before the traditional March 21 as the centuries went by By the 1500s it was starting around March 11 ten days too early according to the calendar So what they did was to move the calendar forward ten days in 1582 and at the same time to make sure it did not happen again To do this they made an exception to the previous leap year rule There would be no February 29 for every year that ends in 00  unless it could be divided by 400 So the year 2000 was a leap year because it could be divided by 400 but 2100 2200 and 2300 will be common years with no February 29

It was first suggested by the Neapolitan doctor Aloysius Lilius and was made official by Pope Gregory XIII for whom it was named on February 24 1582

The months of the Gregorian calendar year are in order

If February has 28 days then the year is 365 days long If February has 29 days then the year is called a leap year and it is 366 days long A leap year usually happens once every four years Some examples of leap years are 2004 2008 and 2012

Not every country started using the new calendar straight away Spain Portugal the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth and most of Italy started to use the new calendar on Friday 15 October 1582 following Julian Thursday October 4 1582 The Spanish and Portuguese colonies adopted the calendar later due to the slowness of communication in those days France adopted the new calendar on Monday 20 December 1582 following Sunday December 9 1582 

The Protestant Dutch provinces of Holland and Zeeland also adopted it in December of that year but most non Catholic countries objected to because they said the new calendar was a Catholic invention 

The Kingdom of Great Britain and the rest of the British Empire adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752 by which time it was necessary to correct by eleven days

In Alaska Friday October 6 1867 was followed by Friday October 18 1867 The day was still called Friday because when the US bought Alaska from Russia the International Date Line was changed when the Gregorian calendar was adopted

In the USSR October Revolution of 1917 was celebrated in November In 1917 the Russian Empire still used the old Julian Calendar Changing the calendar meant 365 days after the revolution started was now in November 1918

In 1923 most Eastern Orthodox Churches changed to the Gregorian calendar Christmas Day is the same as the Catholic and Protestant churches but the date of Easter continues to be worked out differently

The Russian Orthodox Church did not want this change so Russian Christmas Day is about two weeks after the rest of Europe

Japan adopted the Gregorian calendars way of working out leap years on 1 January 1873 but the months have numbers instead of names Japan also starts year one with each new reign but use reign names not the name an emperor might be best known by in the west For example the reign names Meiji year 11868 Taisho 11912 Showa 11926 Heisei 11989 and so on The Western calendar using western year numbers is also widely accepted by civilians and to a lesser extent by government agencies

In the old calendar the year started on March 25 This became 5 April and was used as the first day of the year for working out taxes and rents  Taxes and rents went on using the old way of working out leap years so in 1800 the year started on 6 April But it was not changed in 1900 so the tax year in the United Kingdom still begins 6 April

Sufism is the mystic path of Islam Someone who practices Sufism is called a Sufi a Dervish Wali or a Fakir It could be a Muslim who seeks direct experience of Allah

In Sufism there exist many different orders that were founded from the 12th and 13th centuries until today mostly practiced in Iran

The underlying theme of Sufism is that an individual can achieve God consciousness during his life on Earth The way is to first destroy the difference or the duality that exists between God and him by self destruction of the self or the ego This is known as fanaa Besides various Sufi prayers one should make it a part of life to remain humble considerate and indulge only in acts which help one in his quest to control his desires

After fanaa is achieved the individual is resurrected in the mould of God This is the state where he has achieved the divine love of God He should now try to keep increasing this closeness throughout his lifetime 

Sufi practices are usually defined within the tenets of Islam Hence the practices of sufism are best suited for Muslims only However the underlying message and aim of the quest for the love of God is true for all humanity For a non Muslim the most important ideas in Sufism are love for fellow human beings and living ones life in such a way where all actions are against the self This automatically starts him on the path of fanaa

There are some Muslim schools of thought who oppose Sufism because they feel it obliterates the difference between God and man and bypasses the common method of salvation Also there are non islamic versions of Sufism too

A blacksmith is a person who works with iron and steel The blacksmith hammers hot iron on an anvil to change its shape Blacksmiths make iron and steel tools 

A smith is a person who works in any metal A blacksmith works only with iron and steel A thousand years ago people only knew about seven metals By color gold is yellow copper is red and silver tin lead and mercury are different gray colors Iron is also a gray color if you shine it but usually its surface is covered with a black oxide which is a kind of rust This black color forms very fast in a blacksmiths fire The other metals have light colors but iron is a dark color so it is called the black metal in English A smith who works the black metal is a black smith

A farrier works with iron like a blacksmith The only ironwork a farrier does is to make horseshoes

A blacksmith burns coal or charcoal in a special fire called a forge A bellows pushes air into the forge to make the fire burn hotter The blacksmith puts pieces of iron in the fire to make them hot

Iron must be very hot to shape with a hammer Hot iron becomes cold very soon A blacksmith has only a few seconds to hammer a piece of iron before it must be put back in the fire to become hot again

There are a few ways to change a piece of irons shape with a hammer Here are the most important ways that a blacksmith uses

A punch is a tool like a short stick of iron The end of the punch is flat

A chisel is a tool like a short stick of iron The end of the chisel is sharp to cut 

Iron is one of the 92 natural elements 

Steel is iron with a little carbon in it 

All metals get harder when a smith hammers or bends them This is called work hardening If a smith hammers or bends a piece of metal that is already work hardened it will crack and break To make work hardened metal soft again so that a smith can hammer and bend it more the smith anneals the metal

To anneal iron or steel a blacksmith heats the metal until it no longer pulls a magnet and then makes the metal become cold very slowly Blacksmiths can cover the hot metal with sand so that it takes hours to become cold This makes iron or steel very soft

Steel acts just like iron until a blacksmith heat treats the steel This is a special way to make the steel hot and then cold so that the steel will become hard enough to keep a cutting edge A blade made from a piece of iron will very soon become dull and will not cut Good blades are always made of steel then heat treated and then sharpened

To heat treat steel a blacksmith heats the steel until it no longer pulls a magnet then makes the steel become cold very quickly A blacksmith does this by putting the hot steel into a bucket of water and moving it around until it is cold This is called quenching When this is finished the steel will be as hard as it can be It will be so hard that if someone hits it or drops it it can break like glass 

The next step is to draw the temper or temper the steel so that it will not break like glass To temper steel a blacksmith polishes a part of the steel so that it is smooth and shiny The blacksmith then slowly heats the steel in the fire When the steel is between 300 to 650 degrees Fahrenheit the polished steel will turn different colors These colors do not glow in the dark they look like dye on the polished steel As the steel gets hotter from 300 to 650 degrees F it will turn through the colors yellow then brown then purple then blue Yellow means the steel will still be harder blue means the steel will be softer When the steel turns the color that the blacksmith wants he puts the steel into a bucket of water to stop the change Different tools are tempered to different colors but it also depends on how much carbon there is in the steel Usually stone chisels are tempered to yellow and axes for trees are tempered to blue but the blacksmith has to decide 

A blacksmith does not hammer a blade edge thin A blacksmith hammers the steel so that the edge stays thick After the heat treat and temper stones are used to grind the blade edge to make it sharp

If a blacksmith has a piece of iron or steel but does not know which one it is the blacksmith can heat treat it like steel If it does not become hard then it is not steel Iron will show the same temper colors as steel but it will not be hard

If a blacksmith has an old steel tool and wants to hammer it into a new different tool the blacksmith anneals the steel The steel will then be very soft like iron The blacksmith can then hammer it into a new tool and heat treat and temper it to make a new hard steel tool

A blacksmith must be careful when hammering hardened steel or work hardened iron because small pieces can break off and fly and these can hurt his or her eyes Many blacksmiths wear plastic safety glasses to keep their eyes safe

The first blacksmiths were Hittites who lived in the country now called Turkey They started working iron to make tools around 1500 BCE The ways that tools are made by blacksmiths have changed very little since then

Around 1850 countries like the United States of America and the United Kingdom made new ways to make steel and tools in factories Factories now make tools faster and for less money than blacksmiths There are now very few blacksmiths in countries that have a lot of factories

The few blacksmiths that are still in countries with a lot of factories make iron that is art These blacksmiths make gates stair rails and chairs and tables for outdoors People buy this iron as art because each piece is different from the other pieces

A teacher proposed that the refugee boy should apply for the Gymnasium Khler took his Abitur in 1963 After a two year military service at a Panzergrenadier battalion in Ellwangen he left the Bundeswehr as reserve officer He studied and finally earned a doctorate in economics and political sciences from Eberhard Karls University of Tbingen There he was a scientific research assistant at the Institute for Applied Economic Research from 1969 to 1976

Khler joined the civil service in 1976 when he was employed in the Federal Ministry of Economics In 1981 he was employed in the Chancellery of the state government in Schleswig Holstein He served there under Prime Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg In 1982 Khler was made head of the Ministers office in the Federal Ministry of Finance He rose to head of department in 1987 with responsibility for financial policy and federal industrial interests In 1989 he became head of the department for currency and credit

He is a member of the CDU since 1981 He was Secretary of State in the Federal Ministry of Finance from 1990 to 1993 In that capacity he served as a sherpa for Chancellor Helmut Kohl preparing G7 He also served as the primary German negotiator in the Maastricht Treaty negotiations

Between 1993 and 1998 he served as President of the association of savings banks in Germany In 1998 he was appointed president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development He settled in London where the headquarters of the bank is located

Khler was appointed managing Director and Chairman of the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund in 2000 The government of Gerhard Schrder nominated him This was because their first nominee Caio Koch Weser was rejected by the United States

He lived in Washington DC from 2000 to 2004

On 4 March 2004 Khler resigned his positions because he was nominated as presidential candidate Khler defeated Gesine Schwan on the first ballot by 604 votes to 580 20 votes were cast for minor candidates while one elector was absent because of a heart attack Khler succeeded Johannes Rau as President on 1 July 2004 for a five year term Germanys presidency is a largely ceremonial office However it is also invested with considerable moral authority From 2004 until early 2006 Charlottenburg Palace was the seat of the President of Germany This was because Schloss Bellevue has been renovated

Upon his election Khler said that Patriotism and being cosmopolitan are not opposites Presenting his visions for Germany Khler also said that Germany should become a land of ideas

In July 2005 he suspended the Bundestag at Chancellor Gerhard Schrders request Schrder had lost a motion of confidence in the Bundestag This led to early election for the Bundestag in September 2005

In October 2006 he made a far reaching decision by vetoing a bill It would transfer Germanys Air Safety Administration Deutsche Flugsicherung into private ownership The Bundestag passed this legislation but as President Khler was authorized to not sign it into law if in his opinion it contravenes the constitution In December 2006 he did not sign the Consumer Information Law because the constitution does not allow the federal government to instruct municipal authorities This can only be done by the German states There had only been six previous occasions when Germanys president had chosen to reject bills In most instances less important legislation was involved His vetoes were the first notable examples in recent German history

In his 2007 Christmas address to the nation Khler urged the government to push ahead more quickly with reforms He was also critical of the introduction of the minimum wage in the postal sector stating that a minimum wage that can not be paid by competitive employers destroys jobs

On 22 May 2008 Khler said that he wants to be the candidate for a second term as president On 23 May 2009 he was re elected by the Federal Assembly and was sworn into office for a second term on 1 July 2009

In November 2009 Khler refused to sign the Zugangserschwerungsgesetz into law without further information The law which aims to make it more difficult to access sites on the World Wide Web with child pornography is considered by many legal experts to be unconstitutional

On 31 May 2010 Khler announced his resignation as President of Germany This came after German politicians criticised comments made by Khler in relation to overseas military deployments

He came under criticism for his statement that Germanys military missions abroad also served to secure trade He afterwards stated that his comments referred to piracy off the coast of Somalia Khler stated that there was no substance to accusations that in the interview he had overstepped his formal role by favouring an unconstitutional position After getting no support in the dispute Khler stepped down on 31 May 2010 He made a statement saying I declare my resignation from the Office of President with immediate effect The resignation was considered a surprise The following days he was criticized for not being able to handle criticism while being a rigorous critic himself His unprecedented act of immediate resignation was also considered showing a lack of respect for his position   

As written down in the German constitution the powers of the vacant office were executed by the current President of the Bundesrat Jens Bhrnsen until Christian Wulff was elected president on 30 June 2010

Camellia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Theaceae native to eastern and southern Asia from the Himalaya east to Japan and Indonesia Scientists are still discussing how many species there are The number of species varies between 100 and 250 The genus was named by Linnaeus after Fr Georg Joseph Kamel SJ a Jesuit botanist

They are evergreen shrubs and small trees from 220 m tall The leaves are alternately arranged simple thick serrated usually glossy and 317 cm long The flowers are large and conspicuous 112 cm diameter with 59 petals colour varies from white to pink and red and yellow in a few species The fruit is a dry capsule subdivided into 15 compartments each containing 18 seeds

The genus is generally adapted to acidic soils and does not grow well on chalk or other calcium rich soils Most species also have a high rainfall requirement and will not tolerate drought

Camellia species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Butterflies species

Camellia sinensis is of major commercial importance because tea is made from its leaves Tea oil is a sweet seasoning and cooking oil made by pressing the seeds of Camellia sinensis or Camellia oleifera

Many other camellias are grown as ornamental plants for their flowers about 3000 cultivars and hybrids have been selected many with double flowers as in the gallery below Camellia japonica is the most prominent species in cultivation with over 2000 named cultivars next are C reticulata with over 400 named cultivars and C sasanqua with over 300 named cultivars Popular hybrids include C hiemalis and C williamsii They are highly valued in Japan and elsewhere for their very early flowering often among the first flowers to appear in the late winter Late frosts can damage the flowers

Camellias have a slow growth rate Typically they will grow about 30 centimetres a year until mature although this varies depending on variety and location 

Camellia japonica is the state flower of Alabama as well as the city flower of the Chinese municipality Chongqing

In the United Kingdom a primary school usually comprises a nursery and the first 7 years of a childs full time education

In India Primary Education means the Nursery the Kindergarten and four years of regular schooling thereafter Admission to Nursery classes is for children above two years so that the age is 6 when entering Class I Children are taught language readingwriting skills basic arithmetic and quite a good amount of general information about the country people statesmen great people flora animals However this is true only for schools in the urban areas Rural schools do not have Nursery or Kindergarten they admit straight at Class I when the child is six Further the rural schools use the mother tongue as medium of instruction not resorting to English in any way Primary education is free in government schools Moreover rural primary schools offer free mid day meals to children so that the drop out rate comes down States of West Bengal Maharashtra Manipur Nagaland and Kerala have done very good work in this way of spreading primary education

In Singapore Primary School refers to those students who are normally between the ages of 7 to 12 Primary School is classified as P1 to P6 for Primary 1 to Primary 6 respectively At the end of P6 students sit for a national level Primary School Leaving Exam which is used for placement into Secondary School Prior to Primary School pupils attend Kindergarten School for 2 years

Skimmed milk or skim milk is made when all the cream is removed from whole milk Sometimes only half the cream is removed resulting in semi skimmed milk instead Skimmed milk is more popular in the United States than Britain It contains less fat than whole milk which means that many nutritionists and doctors recommend it for people who are trying to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight Skim milk tends to have a slightly watery flavor which some consumers do not enjoyfact

In the UK milk is marketed and labelled as follows

In the USA milk is marketed primarily by fat content and available in these varieties

Low fat milk has sufficient milk fat removed to bring the levels between 05 2 It also must contain at least 825 solids not fat It must contain 2000IU of vitamin A per quart

Chocolate is a food made from the seeds of a cacao tree It is used in many desserts like pudding cakes candy and ice cream It can be a solid form like a candy bar or it can be in a liquid form like hot chocolate The taste of chocolate is often described as sweet because chocolate makers usually add a lot of sugar and milk for taste

There are three main kinds of chocolate white chocolate milk chocolate and dark chocolate White chocolate tastes much sweeter than the other two types because it has more of the sweeter ingredients in it White chocolate does not have any cocoa in it It is mostly made of cocoa butter Milk chocolate is sweet but not as sweet as white chocolate Milk chocolate has some cocoa Dark chocolate is the least sweet and has the strongest chocolate flavor Dark chocolate has up to 80 85 percent cocoa

Chocolate is safe to eat unless it is eaten in large amounts If you eat chocolate in large amounts such as a bar of chocolate a day there is a risk of getting obese Some people eat it every day Some animals like dogs cannot eat chocolate because it makes them sick People with diabetes can also get sick from eating chocolate Dark chocolate contains ingredients that lower blood pressure and fight disease Small amounts of dark chocolate have been found to lower the risk of heart disease

Making chocolate is a process that has many steps First the cacao beans are collected and put in piles or containers to make them ferment Fermentation makes the sugar in the beans turn into alcohol Then the beans are dried and cleaned Chocolate makers must cook the beans and then crush them to make the cocoa butter and the chocolate liquor come out of them Then the chocolate maker mixes different ingredients together to make the different kinds of chocolate Dark or bittersweet chocolate is made from sugar cocoa butter and chocolate liquor Milk chocolate uses all of those ingredients plus milk and vanilla White chocolate does not contain chocolate liquor but only cocoa butter along with sugar milk and vanilla After these ingredients are put together the chocolate maker is still not finished One of the last things to be done is something called conching Before chocolate is conched it feels very rough in the mouth instead of smooth Conching means crushing the chocolate very finely and keeping it warm so that it is liquid Conching for several hours makes good chocolate The last step in making chocolate is called tempering The chocolate is heated and then shaken and then cooled a few times

There are a number of active ingredients in chocolate The most notable of these are caffeine and theobromine These two chemicals are closely related and are found in all cocoa beans In any bean the amount of each chemical varies depending on the genetics of the tree and the stresses placed on the tree during the growing season it takes 2 houres to make chocolate

The cacao tree was first found to be useful for its seeds about two thousand years ago Early Central Americans and Mexicans used the seeds from the cacao tree to make a drink that tasted bitter not sweet Only the important people could drink it The common average people could not The word for chocolate in almost every language comes from its name in the Nahuatl language of Mexico chocolatl

Later on this drink was made sweeter and made into the treat that is known today as hot chocolate It was made popular by Spanish explorers who brought it from North America to Spain When chocolate was sweetened and made into candy it became a very popular treat for many Europeans At first only the rich could afford chocolate Now many people enjoy it Cacao trees grow in the tropics and most cocoa today is made in Africa Some is made in India

The violin is a string instrument that is played with a bow It has four strings The strings are usually tuned to the notes G D A and E It is held between the left collar bone and the chin Different notes are made by fingering with the left hand while bowing with the right It has no frets or other markers Players have to learn the exact place to put the fingers of the left hand by memory Students learning to play a violin may put dots or stickers on the fingerboard to help them learn how to play

The violin is the smallest and highest pitched string instrument A person who plays the violin is called a violinist A person who makes or fixes a violin is called a luthier

The violin is important in European and Arabian music No other instrument has played such an important part in Europe The modern violin is about 400 years old Similar string instruments have been around for almost 1000 years By the time the modern orchestra started in the 17th century the violin was fully developed It became the most important orchestral instrument Nearly every composer wrote for the violin It is used as a solo instrument in chamber music in orchestral music and in jazz It is also used in folk music 

The violin is sometimes called a fiddle Someone who plays it is a fiddler There is even a verb to fiddle It means to play the fiddle This word can be used as a nickname for the violin It is properly used when talking about folk music

The word violin is related to the word viol The violin was not made directly from the instruments called viols The word violin comes from the Middle Latin word vitula It means stringed instrument This word is also believed to be the source of the Germanic fiddle The modern European violin changed over time from many different bowed stringed instruments They were brought from the Middle East and the Byzantine Empire Most likely the first makers of violins took ideas from three kinds of current instruments They are the rebec in use since the 10th century the Renaissance fiddle and the lira da braccio These instruments were held under the chin and bowed

In the 17th century there were several families of luthiers who were very good at making instruments The most famous violin makers were Stradivarius Amati and Guarneri Some of the instruments that these luthiers made are still here today They are some of the best instruments in existence They can have prices over one million dollars

The biggest part of the violin is the wooden body This acts as a resonating box It makes the vibrating strings sound louder Many of the parts of the violin are named after parts of the body The front is called the belly The back is called the back The sides are the ribs The strings go from near the top of the neck down the fingerboard and on to the tail piece The strings go across the bridge halfway between the end of the fingerboard and the tailpiece The bridge is not fixed onto the violin It is held in place by the strings The strings keep it in place because they are so tight If the strings are completely loosened the bridge will not stay on The bridge helps to send the vibrations of the strings down to the body of the instrument Inside the body there is a soundpost This is a small piece of wood It looks like a small finger It goes from the belly to the back The soundpost is also held in place by the strings In the middle of the belly there are two long curved holes They are called f holes This is because of their shape The top of the strings are wound around pegs The violin can be tuned by turning the pegs The very top of the neck is called the scroll Violins today also have a chinrest This helps to hold the violin against the players shoulder A shoulder rest can also be used These are now made of foam They have special legs to hold them on to the violin Many beginners prefer to use a sponge and an elastic band instead

To make it easier to tune the violin many people find it helpful to have adjusters for fine tuning when the string is only slightly out of tune These adjusters go through holes in the tailpiece They stop the strings from slipping when being tuned

Strings used to be made of gut They are now mostly made of steel or nylon Adjusters can only be used with some strings The front of the violin body is made of spruce The back and sides of the body are made of maple The bow can be made of several kinds of wood An example would be pernambuco Some players today use bows made of carbon fibre The bow is strung with horsehair

It takes years of practice to become a good violinist Beginners start by practicing on the open strings This means that they do not use their left hand fingers At first the beginner can pluck the strings Then he or she can learn how to use the bow After learning how to use the bow the player can learn how to stop the strings with the fingers to get all the different notes At first the learner will play in first position This means that finger 1 is playing a note which is a whole tone above the open string For example on the D string finger 1 is playing the note E When the player becomes more advanced he or she will also play in other positions by moving the left hand up the fingerboard nearer to the bridge There is also a half position in which the first finger is stretched back 

The violinist has to learn to put the fingers in exactly the right place so that the music is in tune This is called intonation He will also learn vibrato This changes the intonation of each note slightly by making it a little bit sharper then a little bit flatter producing a kind of wobble This is important in many styles of music to create mood

Besides plucking there are many special effects Some of them are glissando portamento and harmonics There are also double stopping chords or using scordatura tuning

The violin can be played either standing or sitting down When playing solo music the violinist normally stands When playing in chamber music or in orchestras the violinist sits This was not always the case When sitting the violinist may have to turn his right leg in so that it does not get in the way of the bow

In the 17th and 18th centuries composers wrote a lot of music They wrote the music for solo violin Many of these composers were from Italy They were themselves violinists Some of these violinists are Corelli Vitali Vivaldi Veracini Geminiani Locatelli and Tartini In Germany Schmelzer and Biber wrote some very virtuoso violin music Later in the early 18th century Bach and Handel wrote many masterpieces for the violin

In the Classical music period the great composers Haydn Mozart and Beethoven all wrote solo works for the violin They also wrote a large amount of chamber music especially string quartets

In the Romantic period many virtuoso violin works were written These include concertos by Mendelssohn Saint Sans Brahms Bruch Wieniawski Tchaikovsky and Dvok In the 20th century many virtuoso works were written These include Elgar Sibelius Szymanowski Bartk Stravinsky Berg Prokofiev Shostakovich Hindemith and Penderecki In the 19th century Niccol Paganini was the most famous violinist He composed and played violin music that was harder than anything that had been written before People compared him to the devil because he could play so brilliantly and because he looked thin and moved his body about in strange ways

In recent years the violin has also been used in jazz playing Stphane Grappelli was especially famous for this

Some of the most famous violinists of the last century are Fritz Kreisler Jascha Heifetz David Oistrakh Yehudi Menuhin Ida Haendel and Isaac Stern Today some of the greatest players include Itzhak Perlman Maxim Vengerov Vadim Repin Nigel Kennedy Hilary Hahn Joshua Bell and the fiddler Sara Watkins

A train station or railway station is a place where passengers can get on and off trains andor goods may be loaded or unloaded

A railway track or railway line is a set of two parallel rows of long pieces of steel They are used by trains to transport people and things from one place to another Often there is more than one set of tracks on the railway line For example trains go east on one track and west on the other one

The rails are supported by cross pieces set at regular intervals which spread the high pressure load imposed by the train wheels into the ground They also maintain the rails at a fixed distance apart Ties are usually made from either wood or concrete These often rest on ballast which is a name for very small pieces of broken up rock that are packed together and keep the railway tracks in place 

The rails are inclined slightly towards each other typically on a slope of 1 in 20 and the rims of the train wheels are angled in the same way This helps guide the vehicles of the train along the track Each wheel also has a flange which sticks out from one edge all the way around This makes sure the train does not derail and helps guide the train on sharp curves

Rail transport is the movement of passengers and goods using wheeled vehicles designed to run on railway tracks In most countries this transportation method helps international trade and economic growth Railways provide an energy efficient way to transport material over land The railway tracks are a large part of the system and provide smooth and hard surfaces on which the wheels of the train roll with a little friction Also the track spreads the weight of the train which means larger amounts can be carried than with trucks and roads

A waterway is any body of water that can be used for transportation by people in boats These include rivers lakes oceans and canals

The grey wolf or gray wolf also known as the timber wolf or simply wolf is a mammal of the order Carnivora There are many different wolf subspecies such as the Arctic Wolf Many wolves are listed on the endangered species list

Adult wolves are usually 67 feet in length from nose to tail They usually weigh between 40  176 pounds but can be 26  230 lb Wolves measure 20 38 inches at the shoulder Wolves have fur made up of two layers The top layer is resistant to dirt and the underlayer is water resistant The color of their fur can be any combination of grey white red brown and black

Wolves live in groups called packs The members of the pack are often family members and the number of wolves in a pack is 515 wolves The leaders are called the alpha male and the alpha female Only the alpha male and female may lift their legs to mark the packs territory All other pack members must squat Young wolves are called pups cubs or wolf pups Adult females usually give birth to five or six pups in a litter

A few years ago wolves were put back into Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming The wolves have been very successful in the park There had been no wolves there for a long time Many people were not happy about this because they were afraid that the wolves would eat the sheep and cows near the park However wolves only eat livestock when they can not find wild prey

Wolves in Britain were all killed after centuries of hunting The last wolves survived in the Scottish Highlands There is a legend that the last one was killed there in 1743 by a character called MacQueen

Today an increasing number of influential people want new wolves to be brought to Britain so that they can live in the Scottish Highlands again

Wolves are three times as large as a coyote They kill coyotes when they come into wolf territory and try to steal kills Coyotes mostly stay away from wolves When wolves move away coyotes move in When wolves move in coyotes move out

Wolves will compete with bears for food Black bears almost always lose and for brown and grizzly bears it depends on the wolves and the bear Bears are bigger and stronger than a lone wolf

Wolves will also steal kills from cougars Most of the time a wolf would not win a fight against a cougar but two or more wolves would definitely kill it Wolves kill cougars very often

Wolves are larger and stronger and no lynx would win a fight against a wolf only if the wolf was very small or young it would lose Lynx mostly avoid wolves completely

The Cure began in 1976 as Easy Cure formed by Robert Smith along with schoolmates Michael Dempsey Lol Tolhurst and local guitar hero Porl Thompson They began writing and demoing their own songs almost immediately playing throughout 1977 in Southern England to an ever growing army of fans In 1978 the Easy was dropped along with Porl and an eager trio now known simply as The Cure were quickly signed to Chris Parrys new Fiction label 

In May 1979 their debut album Three Imaginary Boys was released to great acclaim and as the band toured extensively around the UK the singles Boys Dont Cry and Jumping Someone Elses Train were released Michael left the band at the end of the year and Simon Gallup and Matthieu Hartley joined In early 1980 the 4 piece Cure embarked on an exploration of the darker side of Roberts songwriting and emerged with the minimalist classic Seventeen Seconds along with their first bona fide hit single A Forest 

After an intense world tour Matthieu left the group and in early 1981 the trio recorded an album of mournful atmospheric soundscapes entitled Faith which included another successful single in Primary 

The band then set out on a second trip around the world named The Picture Tour and they put out the single Charlotte Sometimes In 1982 The Cure went back into the studio to record the album Pornography which had a dark mood The trip was difficult for the band members and the single The Hanging Garden came out just as Simon left the band

Robert Smith and Lol Tolhurst were now the only band members To feel better the band chose to change the dark mood of the band into a more fun pop mood So they recorded a dance single called Lets Go To Bed and became good friends with the songs film clip director Tim Pope The band continued into 1983 with two more fun singles The Walk and The Lovecats

In early 1990 Roger ODonnell left the group and was replaced by long time band friend Perry Bamonte just in time for a series of headlining European festival shows that included the bands second Glastonbury headline slot The album Mixed Up was released supported by the re mixed singles Never Enough Close To Me and A Forest and in 1991 The Cure at last won some long overdue home recognition with a Brit Award for Best British Group 

In 1992 they recorded Wish a richly diverse multi faceted guitar driven album hailed by some as their best work to date It spawned 3 fabulous hit singles and the glorious Wish Tour that followed was a worldwide sell out The sheer power of the shows inspired the release of two live works in 1993 Paris and Show Immediately after the tour ended guitarist Porl Thompson left the band again and The Cure headlined the XFM Great Xpectations Show in Londons Finsbury Park as a 4 piece The band also contributed urn to the film The Crow and covered Purple Haze for the Hendrix tribute album Stone Free

A nurse is a person who is trained to give care to people who are sick or injured Nurses work with doctors and other health care workers to make patients well and to keep them healthy Nurses also help with end of life needs and assist other family members with grieving

Nursing is a profession like a doctor but training for a nurse is different in how long a person must train and what kind of training they need In some places nurses may train for three to five years or more before they get a license as a nurse

Nurses work in many places Nurses work in hospitals in doctors offices and in the community and they even visit people at home 

Sometimes people decide to become nurses rather than doctors because the nurses will be able to help patients directly by talking to them doing things they need carefully watching that nothing goes wrong and then seeing them as they get better

Like doctors nurses can specialize in what work they do Some nurses train and work to help during surgery Some nurses train to help people understand health problems like nutrition and disease Nurses can do many different jobs to help people

Nurses are in demand because there are not enough nurses to handle hospital needs Because of this shortage nurses will sometimes travel to another location to work for a few months in what is called travel nursing

Nursing in Australia is done by Registered Nurses or Enrolled Nurses Both must complete education past high school An Enrolled Nurse must complete a course of study between 12 and 18 months Registered Nurses need to complete a Bachelor Degree

Spanish Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico 

Spanish Juan es su nombre 

The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico includes the largest main island and a number of smaller islands including Mona Vieques and Culebra Of those three smaller islands only Culebra and Vieques are populated all year Mona is unpopulated but employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources sometimes visit the island to inspect it and its wildlife People can visit the island for hiking and camping by getting the permission needed San Juan on the northern side of the main island is the islands largest city and capital

The history of Puerto Rico began when the Ortoiroid people started living in the island between 3000 and 2000 BC Other tribes for example the Saladoid and Arawak Indians lived in the island between 430 BC and 1000 AD When Christopher Columbus discovered the island in the New World in 1492 and named it San Juan Bautista the people living there were the Tanos 

Since it can be found in the northeastern Caribbean Sea Puerto Rico formed an important part of the Spanish Empire from the early years of the exploration conquest and colonization of the New World The island was a major military post during many wars between Spain and other European countries for control of the region in the 16th 17th and 18th centuries

In 1898 during the SpanishAmerican war Puerto Rico was invaded and became a possession of the United States During the 20th century Puerto Ricos political status changed from time to time The Foraker Act of 1900 created a civil government to replace the military government made after the SpanishAmerican war and the Jones Act of 1917 gave Puerto Rican people United States citizenship Afterwards in 1952 the drafting of Puerto Ricos own Constitution and democratic elections were established 

However the political status of Puerto Rico a Commonwealth controlled by the United States is still not completely defined Many people want to resolve this status while others want the status to remain the same Of the people who want to change the status some want Puerto Rico to become a new US state while others want Puerto Rico to become a fully independent country

Puerto Rico is an archipelago with a main island where most of the population lives two smaller islands with residents and many other smaller islands The main island has a mountain range in the center which covers most of the island The highest point called Cerro de Punta is 4390 feet

Puerto Rico has three main political parties the Puerto Rican Independence Party which favors Puerto Rico becoming an independent nation the New Progressive Party which is supports Puerto Ricos transition to becoming a state of the US and the Popular Democratic Party which supports Colonialism

The issue of the political status of the island meaning wheter its a country a US state or a colony is an issue of debate amongst the Puerto Rican people In the past there have been many attempts to clearly define the islands political status by means of voting most of the time the majority of the people have chosen to remain a colony however in the last status voting the colonial option appeared to have lost well over 90 of its support while the US state option has only gained strength in the last few decades The Puerto Rican Independence party on the other hand has mainly lost a great deal of support within the last six decades

The population of Puerto Rico is nearly about 4 million people The ethnic composition of the population is

Somalis are a nation of related families which are called clans Groups of clans sometimes band together based on a common ancestor or other blood relationship Sometimes these family relationships date back hundreds or even thousands of years in the past Somalis are mostly camel or goat herders and depend on their livestock to live In Somalia there are limited sources of drinking water and grazing land and disputes over grazing rights water rights or land in general can lead to fighting between families Because of the clan system the families involved will call on their clan for help leading to a clan war The discovery of oil and minerals in Somalia as well as the power and money associated with politics and business has created more opportunities for families to get ahead and has also created more reasons for families to have disputes

Because Somalia does not have a working legal system the only help a family in Somalia has to solve a dispute with another family is to get their clan involved The only solution to the clan wars in Somalia is a working legal system but the only group who has succeeded in creating one is the Islamic Courts Union Unfortunately the Islamic Courts Union was accused of being terrorists and Ethiopia invaded Somalia to topple their government and put the government they created in power instead

In ancient times Somalia was a place where people from Egypt and Arabia went to buy Gum Arabic Myrrh and Ebony Wood The Ancient Egyptians used to call it Punt which meant Gods Land Somalis started herding camel and goats about 4000 years ago and they remain mostly herders today

Visitors from as far away as China visited Somalia like Zheng He

About 2100 years ago the royal family of a kingdom in Iran called the Bazrangids decided to move to East Africa to get away from being conquered by another kingdom and built several cities in southern Somalia including Mogadishu and Baraawe Around the same time a kingdom in Yemen called Himyar started building market towns in northern Somalia which would eventually turn into the modern cities of Berbera and Zeila

About 1400 years ago the king of Ethiopia attacked the king of Himyar and made northern Somalia part of his kingdom 300 years later the first Ethiopian kingdom would fall apart and the region the king of Ethiopia took over in northern Somalia converted to Islam A new Ethiopian kingdom was founded about a hundred years later and this area which would come to be known as Ifat became part of Ethiopia again but it remained quite independent and Muslim where Ethiopia was Christian

400 more years later the king of Ethiopia told his subjects that God hated Ifat and he invaded Ifat with his army destroying everything he came across and driving the king of Ifat to an island off the coast of Zeila where he died The king of Ethiopia then took part of Ifat and added it to his kingdom and made Ifat pay him lots of money once a year The remains of Ifat put their kingdom back together again and renamed it Adal

About a hundred years later the King of Adal was deposed by an influential warlord by the name of Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al Ghazi who had lots of influence with Somali clans across the north He declared a Jihad against Ethiopia brought together a huge army that included Turkish musketeers and Somali cavalry The Somali cavalry were especially deadly because they could shoot arrows while riding their horses something that the Mongol hordes and Japanese Samurai are also famous for

Ahmad chose a bad time however because the Portuguese Empire was muscling into East Africa They had taken over the whole east African coast up to Baraawe and were trying to take over Mogadishu The Portuguese decided to help out the Ethiopians because the Ethiopians were Christians and the Portuguese did not like Muslims Ahmad had taken over more than half of Ethiopia when a troop of Portuguese musketeers showed up to help the Ethiopians out One Portuguese musketeer managed to shoot Ahmad himself killing him

A lot of the Somali cavalry was only there because of Ahmad so the Jihad ended and Ethiopia wound up invading Adal The Turks had to send an army to stop them from taking over Zeila and Adal ended up becoming part of the Turkish Ottoman Empire On those days we do not find the exact people dwell in zeila but the history ascribed the black people without tracing their origin and their tribes However some historians attributed Zeila inhabitant were called semaale without farther lucid explanation

The Turks and Portuguese fought over East Africa for the next 200 years but the Turks eventually won about 270 years ago Northern Somalia stayed under Turkish protection after Ahmad died and the east coast including Mogadishu ended up under the protection of the King of Oman When Egypt declared independence from the Turks a hundred years later Northern Somalia became part of Egypt Egypt came under British protection shortly after that and northern Somalia basically became a British protectorate as well This became official about 130 years ago and northern Somalia officially became British Somaliland

The Kingdom of Italy had just come together as one country around this time and wanted the same things that the other big countries had like colonies Italy offered to buy the rights to the east Africa coast from Oman who was in charge of protecting the cities and small kingdoms there and Oman agreed Italy made deals with some of the larger kingdomssultanates for them to be under Italian protection but the smaller ones Italy just invaded This became Italian Somalia

Ethiopia which had fallen apart again after Ahmads Jihad had recently put itself back together again as well and started invading small Somali kingdoms as well and by 1890 there were not many left The French got in on this too but they just took over a small area which today is Djibouti

Lots of Somalis did not like what was going on so a Muslim religious leader named Mohammed Abdullah Hassan started a group called the Darwiish to fight the British Italians and Ethiopians The British called him the Mad Mullah and spent about 30 years fighting him eventually using fighter planes against his cavalry At their height the Darwiish controlled almost a third of Somalia

When Benito Mussolini took power in Italy he ended the deals he made with the bigger Somali sultanates and invaded them conquering all the area that was to be the colony of Italian Somalia Then he invaded and took over Ethiopia using poison gas on the Ethiopians Shortly afterwards World War 2 broke out and he invaded British Somaliland but two years later the British returned and liberated British Somaliland and Ethiopia as well as taking over Italian Somaliland

After the war Britain wanted to put all of the places Somalis lived in one country which would be a British protectorate The Ethiopians complained that they should be able to keep the areas they conquered and the Italians also complained the same thing so in the end the Ethiopians got to keep their bit and the Italians did too However Italian Somaliland was put under a United Nations mandate so the Italians could not make it a colony

In 1960 both British and Italian Somaliland declared independence together as the Republic of Somalia It was chosen the Latin alphabet for the Somalian language Many areas where Somalis lived were still part of Britain Ethiopia and France Somalia wanted to get back all the areas that had been colonized by the French Ethiopians and British Somalia and Ethiopia had a short war in 1964 over the Ethiopian part of Somalia and it was obvious that more fighting was to come

In 1969 the President of Somalia was killed by a man whose clan had been hurt by his policies and General Mohammed Siad Barre took over the country Siad Barre built a huge army with help from the Soviet Union and when Ethiopia fell for the fourth time he invaded The Soviet Union decided that Ethiopia was more important than Somalia and double crossed Siad Barre supplying huge amounts of weapons to Ethiopia Other countries like Cuba and Israel also sent help to Ethiopia so in the end Siad Barre lost the war

Ethiopias new government then began helping Somali rebel groups who did not like how Siad Barre took over the country and these rebel groups toppled Siad Barre government in 1991 and forced him out of the country After this however all of the rebel groups started fighting amongst themselves over who would be in charge now that Siad Barre was gone

Eventually some of the rebel groups decided to make their own governments in the land that they controlled One called Somaliland declared independence from Somalia entirely while another called Puntland declared independence for now until a new Somali national government can be put together Dozens of attempts to create a new national government failed

Because there was no government in most of Somalia Somalias only legal system beyond the law of the gun was traditional custom and Islamic Sharia law Because of this Sharia legal scholars in the lawless south of Somalia gained quite a bit of influence Around the same time the people fighting for Somali lands in Ethiopia to be part of Somalia turned to the example of the Afgani Mujahideen and created their own group called al Ittihad al Islamiyya or the Islamic Union During the 1990s Ethiopia invaded Somalia several times to attack the Islamic Union who were helping Somali rebels in Ethiopia

After 2001 the United States of America became very suspicious of both the Sharia courts and the Islamic Union of being terrorists Warlords made a group called the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter Terrorism The Sharia courts banded together to protect themselves and created the Islamic Courts Union People liked the Sharia courts and hated the gangsters so everyone helped the Islamic Courts Union who defeated the gangsters and drove them out of Mogadishu in 2006 The Islamic Courts Union then formed an army and took over most of southern Somalia

The United States of America and Ethiopia was alarmed by this takeover so Ethiopia invaded southern Somalia in 2007 and put a new government in power that was made up of the rebel groups that Ethiopia had funded 15 years earlier Almost everyone disagreed with this decision and that same year a rebellion against this new government broke out in Mogadishu and spread across the whole country by 2008

Capitalism is a kind of economic system where things are owned by people or an individual not by a government or communities and where people have to work for money so they can buy things they need or want such as food Capitalism mostly has a free market economy which means people buy and sell things by their own judgment In most countries in the world today the economy also has a degree of planning done by the government or by trade unions so they are actually called mixed economies instead of completely free markets Some people disagree on whether capitalism is a good idea or how much of capitalism is a good idea

The word comes from capital meaning something of value This can be money or any other goods that can be traded Capital originally comes from the Latin word caput meaning head because it was used to mean how many head of cattle a wealthy person owned in days long ago when cattle were used as money

In capitalism people may sell or lend their property and other people may buy or borrow them If one person wants to buy and another person wants to sell to them they do not need to get permission from higher power People can have a market without anyone else telling them to The definition of capitalism and the free market economy was introduced by the philosopher Adam Smith in his book The Wealth of Nations

The word capitalat can be used to produce more things or money For example lands factories shops tools and machines are capital If someone has money that can be invested that is a capital too People who own capital are sometimes called capitalists They can hire anyone who wants to work in their factories shops or lands for them for the pay they offer 

In capitalist systems many people are workers They have to work for others in order to get money for living People can choose to work for anyone who will hire them in a free market 

This is different from many older economic systems In feudalism most people were serfs and had to work for the people who owned the land they lived on In mercantilism the government makes it hard to buy things from other countries In many countries with mixed economies there are laws about what you can buy or sell or what prices you can charge or whom you can hire or fire

An investment is when people invest their money in things People can put their money together to buy or build things even if they are too big for one person to make alone The people who invest get to be the owners of what they buy or build together The stock market lets people buy and sell investments

Investing is important to capitalism The word capitalist can mean two things it can mean someone who likes capitalism but it can also mean someone who invests For examplea venture capitalist invests in new businesses

People who start businesses or invest in businesses can make a lot of money A business sells things that people want The investors make extra money which is called profit Investors can take their profit and invest it in more businesses or in making the business bigger The investors can get more and more profit if the businesses are successful

Socialists anarchists and communists are people who do not support capitalism They say it hurts workers because businesses make more money by selling things than they pay to the workers who make the things and therefore businessmen become rich while workers remain poor andor exploited They also argue society would be more efficient if the individual was considerate of not only hisher interests but the overall well being of society rather than competing against one another Another argument is that each person has a right to minimal needs and within capitalism sometimes people are not considerate of others or the environment in their quest for capital The main difference between communists and spiritual communists is spiritual solidarity as opposed to a state centered solidarity that most communists seek

Karl Marx was a famous communist philosopher from Germany He wrote a famous book called The Capital He said that capitalism would go away after workers decided to take over the government in a revolution There were violent communist revolutions in many countries and many people were killed because of this But capitalism did not go away and most of these Communist systems have collapsed and do not exist today or else they have become more capitalist Some people think that communism in those countries did not work because Marxs ideas though nice in thought did not really work Others think that communist countries collapsed because of the attacks from capitalist countries

Anarchists do not support capitalism either They do not think workers should take the government but that there should be no government at all They think that communism failed because the communists set up dictatorships that said that they would rule in the name of workers instead of letting workers organize themselves freely

There are different words for people who support capitalism In many parts of the world these people are called either conservatives or liberals But in the United States the word liberal means someone whose beliefs lean toward socialism more or less what in other countries might be called social liberal Libertarian is a word that in America and some other countries means someone who opposes the state much like an anarchist but is strongly in favor of capitalism

People who support capitalism also have disagreements Most people agree that capitalism can only work if the government keeps people from stealing other peoples things If people could steal anything then nobody would want to buy anything

In most countries the government does more than that It tries to make sure that people buy and sell fairly and that businesses do not hurt workers Because the government takes a lot of money in taxes it also buys a lot of things and gives a lot of money away It spends money on guns and ships for the military on science research in universities and on schools and libraries It also gives money to people who do not have jobs and to businesses that the political leaders think are important Sometimes government gives money to people just because those people support the politicians who are in office When the government is in charge of part of the economy this is called a mixed economy

A few people think that people can protect themselves without any government Instead of having laws against stealing people could protect their own things or agree to pay other people such as arbitrators insurers and private defenders to protect them This belief is called anarcho capitalism These people think that the government is a thief because it takes taxes away from people against their will and keeps them from making agreements between themselves

A chicken is a kind of domesticated bird It is raised widely for its meat and eggs There are 24 billion chickens worldwide They are usually kept by humans as livestock which means it is kept for its meat and eggs Chickens are said to be flightless because they can only jump short distances 

A male chicken is called a rooster or a cock A female chicken is called a hen A young chicken is called a chick Like other female birds hens lay eggs which can hatch into chicks 

When raising chickens a farmer needs to build a chicken coop for the chickens to roost in They also need a run or yard where they can exercise take dust baths eat and drink The chickens also need to be protected from predators such as foxes which is often done with fences 

Chickens can also be farmed intensively This lets farms make a lot of chicken meat and eggs but this is not good for the chickens

Chicken pox has nothing to do with chickens When chicken pox was first described it was noted that the pox spots looked like the vegetable called chick peas placed upon the skin The Latin word for chick peas is cicer and that is the original word that chicken pox got its name from

Because of the low cost chicken meat is one of the most used meat in the world Americans eat 8 billion chickens every year The most popular dishes with chicken are Buffalo wings butter chicken chicken rice chicken soup fried chicken roasted chicken and tandoori chicken

In some parts of the world people breed chickens to fight and they bet money on which of two gamecocks will win In many places this is illegal

The first song he recorded for Capitol was Straighten Up and Fly Right He wrote the song The words were based on his fathers teachings The song became one of the biggest hits of 1943 It sold more than 500000 copies

Nat recorded hundreds of songs Some of the most popular include Sweet Lorraine Nature Boy Those Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer When I Fall in Love and Mona Lisa In 1950 the American film industry gave him an award for his recording of Mona Lisa That song made him famous as a singer

Nat King Cole also acted in movies The best known one is Saint Louis Blues He played the part of the jazz composer WC Handy He also appeared in a movie about himself called The Nat King Cole Story

George Gershwin was an American composer

George Gershwin was born on September 26 1898 in Brooklyn New York His family immigrated to the United States Gershwin his two brothers and sister had a close happy family life George liked playing games on the streets of New York He liked exploring the city but he did not like school or studying

While exploring the city Gershwin heard jazz and blues music spilling out of public drinking places However he did not become seriously interested in music until he heard another boy playing the violin in a concert at his school Gershwin began to take piano lessons His teacher was a fine classical musician He immediately recognized Gershwins unusual ability The teacher wrote about him to a friend I have a student who will make his mark in music if anybody will The boy is a genius without doubt

Gershwin studied classical piano and he was a first rate pianistbut his strongest interest continued to be jazz and popular music At the age of fifteen he left school and went to work in the music business The New York City street where most music publishers had their offices was called Tin Pan Alley

The phonograph and radio had been invented in the late 1800s But it would be many years before there were musical recordings or regular radio broadcasts Tin Pan Alley publishers needed another way to sell new songs so they employed people to play the piano to do this

The piano players played the songs all day long to interested singers and other performers Gershwin was one of the youngest piano players in Tin Pan Alley Soon he was considered one of the finest there He was already writing his own songs He succeeded in getting one published when he was only 18 years old It had a long title When You Want Em You Cant Get Em When Youve Got Em You Dont Want Em 

Gershwin was now a real composer The rest of his life was an unbroken record of success He wrote song after song His ideas were so endless that he was not even troubled when he once lost some music he had been writing There is plenty more where that came from he said

Gershwin had his first big hit in 1919 when he was twenty one years old It was a song called Swanee A popular entertainer Al Jolson sang the song Swanee was made into one of the first musical recordings Gershwin was suddenly famous

Music critics note that Swanee is not like most of Gershwins music Later he wrote true love songs Some were light and funny Some were full of intense feeling Many of these songs were written for the popular musical theater One of his most emotional love songs never became part of a musical play however It is called The Man I love

Gershwins older brother Ira wrote the words to The Man I Love As George became famous Ira wrote the words to more and more of his songs

The two brothers were very different Ira the writer was quiet and serious George the musician was outgoing  the life of any party When they had to finish a new musical Ira locked George in a hotel room until it was done But George wrote better songs with Ira than with anyone else 

One of many examples of the Gershwins combined work is the song They Cant Take That Away From Me The Gershwins wrote the song for dancer and actor Fred Astaire for the film Shall We Dance That was George and Ira Gershwins first movie musical 

Many of George Gershwins songs were first written for musical plays performed in theaters in New York City These comedies with plenty of songs were a popular form of entertainment in the 1920s and 1930s 

One of Gershwins musical plays Girl Crazy introduced a young singer named Ethel Merman She became one of the most celebrated performers in America In the play Merman sang a song George Gershwin wrote just for her It was called I Got Rhythm

Many songs that George Gershwin wrote for musical plays and movies have remained as popular as ever Over the years they have been sung and played in every possible way  from jazz to country

One example is the song Someone to Watch Over Me It was written for the 1926 musical Oh Kay

In the nineteen twenties there was a debate in the United States about jazz music Could jazz some people asked be considered serious music

In 1924 jazz musician and orchestra leader Paul Whiteman decided to organize a special concert to show that jazz was serious music Gershwin agreed to compose something for the concert before he realized how little time he had to do it The concert was just a few weeks away Gershwin got busy and in that short time he composed a piece for piano and orchestra He called it Rhapsody in Blue

Gershwin himself played the piano part of Rhapsody in Blue at the concert The audience included some of the greatest classical musicians of the time When they heard his music they were electrified It seemed to capture for the first time the true voice of modern American culture Today we can still hear Gershwin playing Rhapsody in Blue An old mechanical piano recording Gershwin created has been reproduced exactly There are also very early versions of Rhapsody in Blue which feature Gershwin playing the piano with Whitemans orchestra Those recordings because they are early do not sound like modern recordings But they are recordings of Gershwin at the piano This makes those recordings important

Rhapsody in Blue made George Gershwin famous all over the world Several hundred thousand copies of the printed music sold immediately Gershwin was satisfied that he had shown that jazz music could be both serious and popular

Gershwin also wrote an opera Porgy and Bess It was based on a book by DuBose Heyward It is a tragic love story about black Americans along the coast of South Carolina

Porgy And Bess opened in Boston Massachusetts in 1935 Audiences loved it But most critics did not know what to think of it It was not like any other opera or musical play they had ever seen

Gershwin did not care about the critics opinions He believed some of his greatest music had gone into the opera He said he had created a new musical form  an opera based on popular culture Today Porgy And Bess is considered a masterpiece

Another well known Gershwin piece is An American in Paris It is a long tone poem for orchestra Its first public performance was by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in 1928

Once again opinion was mixed Most people loved An American in Paris as they loved all of Gershwins music Some critics liked it too They called it happy and full of life Others hated it They called it silly and long winded Still it remains one of his most popular works

George Gershwin died in 1937 just days after doctors learned he had brain cancer He was only thirty eight years old Newspapers all over the world reported his death on their front pages Everyone mourned the loss of the man and all the music he might have written Gershwin is still considered one of Americas greatest composers His works still are performed by many singers and groups They are probably performed more often than any other serious American composer

Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg was one of the people who praised George Gershwin Schoenberg said Gershwin was a man who lived in music and expressed everything through music because music was his native language

Aaron Copland was an American composer who wrote modern music

Aaron Copland wrote many kinds of music He wrote music for the orchestra piano and voice He wrote music for plays movies and dance Copland also was a conductor pianist speaker teacher and author

Music critics say Copland taught Americans about themselves through his music He used parts of many old American folksongs in his work He wanted to do this after studying music in France He said that composers there had a very French way of writing music He said Americans had nothing like that in this country So he decided to compose music that was truly American

Aaron Copland was born November 14 1900 in Brooklyn New York He died at the age of 90 on December 2 1990 He was the youngest of five children His parents had come to the United States from eastern Europe They owned a store in Brooklyn Aaron began playing the piano when he was a young child He wrote his first song for his mother when he was eight years old His dreams of becoming a composer began when he was young When he was sixteen he asked his parents to let him study composing with Rubin Goldmark Goldmark had taught the composer George Gershwin

When he was in his early twenties Copland went to Paris France where he studied music with Nadia Boulanger She was one of the most important music teachers of the time He returned to New York in 1924

The famous conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra Serge Koussevitzky learned about Coplands music Koussevitzky led the orchestra for the first performance of Coplands early work Music for the Theater in 1925 Koussevitzky also conducted Coplands Concerto for Piano and Orchestra in 1927 This work was unusual because Copland used ideas from jazz music in his concerto

Copland later wrote the music for two ballets about the American West One was about the life of a famous gunfighter called Billy the Kid Copland used music from American cowboy songs in this work This piece from Billy the Kid Ballet Suite is called Street in a Frontier Town

In 1942 the conductor Andre Kostelanitz asked Copland to write music about a great American Abraham Lincoln Copland wrote Lincoln Portrait to honor Americas 16th president Coplands music included parts of American folk songs and songs popular during the American Civil War He added words from President Lincolns speeches and letters

Lincoln Portrait has been performed many times in America Many famous people have done the speaking partEleanor Roosevelt the wife of President Franklin D Roosevelt was one of them Here actor James Earl Jones performs in Coplands Lincoln Portrait

In 1942 the music director of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra asked 18 composers to write music expressing love for America For the competition Copland composed Fanfare for the Common Man This music is played in America during many national events including some presidential inaugurations

Experts say Fanfare for the Common Man was an example of the way Copland changed the kind of music he wrote during the 1940s He began writing music that was more easily understood and more popular Copland wrote about this in 1941 in his book Our New Music

He wrote that the radio and record player was helping people who had never listened to music before to enjoy music He said that there was no reason to continue writing music as if these things had not been invented So he decided to write music in a simpler way

Copland spread his ideas about music in other ways He taught at the New School for Social Research in New York City and at Harvard University in Cambridge Massachusetts One of the many awards he received was the Pulitzer Prize He won it in 1945 for his famous music for a ballet called Appalachian Spring It is one of his most popular works The last part of the ballet is based on a traditional song A Gift to be Simple

Copland also wrote music for several major motion pictures He won an Academy Award in 1950 for composing the music for the film The Heiress Then he began experimenting with what is called the twelve tone system His music was no longer as easy to understand nor as popular

Copland stopped composing at the end of the 1960s Yet he continued to be active as a conductor and speaker In 1982 Queens College of the City University of New York established the Aaron Copland School of Music

Copland was a strong supporter of liberal ideas In the early 1950s he and other famous writers actors and intellectuals were accused of supporting communism Public opinion changed though In 1964 President Lyndon B Johnson presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom It is Americas highest award to civilians Aaron Copland died in 1990 at the age of 90 But his music lives on

A Diphthong is a vowel that a person has to move his or her mouth into two different positions to make It is a vowel where two different vowel qualities can be heard Examples are waist die noise road house fierce bear sure Each of these is a different vowel sound

A monophthong is a simple vowel sound that a person does not have to move his mouth to make like the oo sound in book In a diphthong the person combines two different monophthongs as with the oi sound in the word oil The person starts with the mouth in the position to make an o sound then quickly moves the mouth to make a hard e sound Another example is the ou sound in the word house The mouth starts out making a sound like the soft a sound in flat then moves to make the a hard oo sound like the one in caboose

Just like with every other part of language the exact way to pronounce a diphthong is a little different for different accents

The word diphthong is derived from the old Greek language Here di means two or double while the part phthong means sound or tone from the basic word phthalein which means speak creating sound by the voice 

A diphthong can be a lexeme of a language and as such it may be one syllable but rarely

A monophthong is simply a vowel The word monophthong comes from the old Greek language Mono means one or single and the phthong means sound or tone from the basic word phthalein which means to speak create sound with the voice The word monophthong shows that a vowel is spoken with exactly one tone and one mouth position For example when you say teeth then while you are creating the sound of the ee nothing changes for that sound

A monophthong can be a lexeme of a language and as such it can as well be a syllable There is no shorter syllable than a single monophthong

Kalua is a Hawaiian cooking method It means da pit the hole The oven is a hole in the ground called an imu Kalua is most often used to cook pig Kalua pig is a popular food at luaus

People today kalua pig in the same way that ancient Hawaiians did Kalua pig is still served at luaus However it is illegal to sell kalua pig if it has been cooked underground Hawaiians today still enjoy kalua pig that has been cooked in an imu at baby luaus and parties Some companies try to imitate the flavor using liquid smoke to make kalua pig but if you have had the real thing braddah you can tell the difference

Ultraviolet is a color of light that people cannot see but can be seen by many animals mostly insects reptiles which include such animals as crocodiles and newts and small birds

The name ultraviolet is in part derived from the ancient Latin language The prefix ultra means behind beyond or far Ultraviolet is beyond the visible violet light in terms of frequency wavelength and energy

UV is a common abbreviation of ultraviolet mainly used in technical environments

Ultraviolet light can be dangerous to ones health For instance sunlight contains UV rays that can cause sunburn and lead to various cancers Industrial UV rays which often emanate from X ray machines can induce cancer and render people infertile 

There is no obvious difference between X rays and ultraviolet only that the low energy low frequency large wavelength ultraviolet in the neighbourhood of visible violet is not suitable for X raying whereas the even higher energetic even higher frequency even shorter wavelength X rays are a component of radioactivity which is called gamma rays or gamma radiation

Technically electromagnetic waves with a frequency of 789 terahertz or more are called ultraviolet This corresponds with a wavelength from 380 nanometers down to approximaltey 5 nanometers A single light quantum of ultraviolet carries an energy around some 326 electron volt the more the higher its frequency

Although the air of the earth is transparent to a broad range of ultraviolet some ultraviolet sunlight is absorbed at a very high altitude by the ozone layer Recent and ongoing destruction of ozone in high altitudes caused by human influence  mostly by industrial chemicals and air travel  has greatly increased the amount of ultraviolet light reaching the earth surface This in turn has increased the risk of skin cancer to mankind and this risk will only increase with time

Ultraviolet wavelengths less than 200 nanometers X rays and gamma rays are collectively called ionizing radiation since the energy in any such light quantum is high enough to kick an electron out of an atom This is the reason why these kinds of radiation are dangerous to life

Ordinary glass does not let radiation through if its wavelength is less than 200 nanometers so it acts as a shield against the more dangerous range of ultraviolet light but some special sorts of glass do not shield as well including many car windows

The sun is one source of Ultraviolet radiation

Some uses for Ultraviolet Radiation is tanning Or to melt something naturally You can even make a little set up to cook something off the cement with the suns UV rays

A computer virus is a program that is able to copy itself when it is run Very often computer viruses are run as a part of other programs Biological viruses also work that way as they copy themselves as part of other organisms This is how the computer virus got its name 

In addition to copying itself a computer virus can also execute instructions that cause harm For this reason computer viruses affect security They are part of malware 

Very often the term is also used for other kinds of malware such as trojan horses and worms Even though this is wrong it may be difficult to tell the difference between different kinds of malware they often occur together and only an expert may be able to tell them apart Several such programs also fit more than one category

There are different kinds of computer viruses

In the beginning the operating systems used on Personal Computers did not have the concept of access control There were no users everyone could do everything More modern operating systems have the concept of access control There can be more than one user and there are privileges Certain users are only able to read certain files and they may have no access to certain files Other users are able to modify or delete certain files These privileges can be specified for each file 

The damage a virus can cause is influenced by the rights it has if the user has no rights to write to certain places in the system the virus will not be able to spread 

Another problem is that sometimes the system for rights management may be available but that it is not used by default This is the case with systems such as Windows NT or Windows XP where by default all users have all rights

Antivirus software can protect against known viruses Some antivirus software scan files and compare a hash code for each file with its database of hash codes If the code matches it has likely found a virus This way of doing things has some problems It will only protect against viruses whose hash code is known The companies who wrote the antivirus need to keep the virus signatures up to date and need to give this information to the PC that is to be protected

There are two possible modes of scanning Either the file is scanned on demand or it is scanned when the system registers an access to the file

Antivirus software cannot offer full protection even in the case the virus is known Some viruses use something called polymorphic code to change their signature every time they move No matter how many signatures the company has they will not be able to stop these types of viruses

Another way that antivirus software can protect against viruses is to use heuristics Instead of knowing each virus by its signature heuristic antivirus software looks at the behavior of software If the software does something that seems bad the antivirus software stops it Since every step needs to be watched is a very slow way to do things

The best protection against viruses can be obtained by using a system that boots off a read only medium such as a CD or DVD and that does not allow write access to hard disk drives

A superlative in grammar is an adjective describing a noun that is the best example of a given quality In other words a superlative describes a noun that has more of some quality than any other 

Some examples

In English most superlatives can be formed by adding EST to an existing adjective like the examples above

Some adjectives have irregular superlative forms which do not follow the rules such as far 

Other adjectives have no superlative form at all and the superlative is made simply by adding the adverb most before the adjective For instance you do not say funnest or interestingest Instead you say most fun and most interesting This way of making the superlative is used for almost all adjectives ending in ing

Cold is a relative term used in comparison with the adjective warm Because it is relative there is no range in coldness The temperatures in the winter season are often categorized as being cold Cold is the opposite of hot 

The coldest possible temperature is 27315 C which can be expressed as about 45967 F on the Fahrenheit scale This is called absolute zero Absolute zero is also 0 K on the Kelvin scale and 0 R on the Rankine scale

Cooling is when an object gets cold or lowers in temperature This can happen by taking away heat or by putting something in a place with a lower temperature Fluids used to cool objects are called coolants

Air cooling making the temperature of an object lower using air This will only work if the air is at a lower temperature than the object The process will work better if there is more surface area on the object or if the items mass can be made smaller

Other ways to cool objects include using ice dry ice or liquid nitrogen This works by convection the heat is taken from the relatively warm object to the relatively cold coolant

Electrical conductance is an electrical phenomenon where a material contains movable particles with electric charge which can carry electricity When a difference of electrical potential is placed across a conductor its movable charges flow and an electric current appears

A conductor such as a metal has high conductivity and an insulator like glass or a vacuum has low conductivity A semiconductor has a conductivity that varies widely under different conditions

Electrical conductivity is the reciprocal of electrical resistivity

Anakin Skywalker is a young boy who meets Obi Wan Kenobi and learns the ways of the Jedi Anakin later goes to the Dark Side and turns against Obi Wan Kenobi and the rest of the Jedi Before he turned against his wife Anakin has two children with Senator Amidala Leia and Luke Skywalker that he does not know about Senator Amidala dies as she was giving birth to her twin children After birth the twins are separated to prevent the Dark Side from finding and hurting the children Obi Wan Kenobi sends Luke to a planet called Tatooine to live with his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru Leia is raised by Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan she is called Princess Leia Organa When they get older Luke and Leia are united together again They help fight the evil government called the Empire Luke also learns the ways of a Jedi from Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda In the end they defeat the Empire and Luke helps Anakin become good again The galaxy is saved

Many books short movies and videogames have been produced that deal with events that do not happen in the original movies They also tell more about things that did happen in the movies For example the book Death Star tells about the building and destruction of the space station from the original movie It tells much about things seen in that movie but from the point of view of the people on the station Most of the stories in the Expanded Universe are about the rebuilding of the Republic after the Empires defeat They are set anywhere from the early Sith Wars which happened 5000 years before Episode VI to more than one hundred years after Episode VI

The Korean language is spoken mainly in North and South Korea It is spoken by more than 78 million people

In South Korea it is called hangukmal or hangugeo In North Korea however it is called chosnmal or chosn They are named differently because the common names for North and South Korea are different In additional koreans usually call their language urimal or urinara mal meaning our language or our countrys language

Kansas is a state in the Midwestern United States of America Kansas has a total population of 29 million with an area of convert82000sqmikm20lkonabbron making Kansas the 34th largest state by population and the 15th largest state by area The name of the state comes from the Kansa Native Americans whose name comes from a Siouan language phrase meaning people of the south wind The land that would become Kansas was bought in the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 After becoming a free state Kansas became a state on January 29 1861 becoming the 34th state to admitted to the United States Kansas capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita

Kansas is in a region known as Americas Breadbasket Like other states in this area Kansas is a large producer of wheat and other grains producing one fifth of all wheat grown in the United States In addition to wheat Kansas produces large amounts of grain sorghum summer potatoes and sunflowers with other industries in Kansas including aviation and communications

The terrain of Kansas consists of mountain ranges prairies and forests All of Kansas is in the Great Plains

In 1539 Marcos de Niza a friar reported rumors of Cbola a city of gold to Spanish colonial officials in Mexico City Niza said the city was in modern day New Mexico In response to the rumors two years later Francisco Vzquez de Coronado with an army of 300 Spaniards and 800 Mexicans marched northward from Culiacn in hopes of finding the city When Coronado did not find the city in New Mexico he continued northeast into the Mississippi Valley crossing the present area of Kansas diagonally This made Conrado and his army the first Europeans to see the Great Plains including Kansas Later Juan de Oate also traveled to Kansas in 1601

In 1682 Marquette Joliet Hennepin and other French leaders took formal control of the Mississippi Valley including the land that would become Kansas This land known as the Louisiana territory was used to organize trade with Native Americans In 1762 France ceded the Louisiana territory to Spain However in 1801 Spain receded the territory back to France in the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso On April 30 1803 Napoleon sold the Louisiana territory to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase In the early 1800s Kansas was used to hold Native Americans that were removed from their native lands

On May 30 1854 the Congress signed the Kansas Nebraska Act The Kansas Nebraska Act stated that Kansas and Nebraska were both territories of the United States It also stated that Kansans would vote on the legality of slavery 

Upon hearing this about 1200 armed New Englanders came to Kansas to vote against slavery However thousands of southerners mostly from Missouri came to vote for slavery The final vote was to make slavery legal and Kansas adopted most of Missouris slave laws There was fighting between Southerners and Northerners in Kansas In one fight John Brown and his man killed five people in the Pottawatomie Massacre Later Southerners destroyed Lawrence Kansas During this period Kansas was called Bleeding Kansas

Between 1854 and 1861 Kansas proposed four state constitutions Out of the four proposed constitutions three did not allow slavery Finally in July 1859 Kansas passed the Wyandotte Constitution which was anti slavery The constitution for statehood was sent to the US government in April 1860 to be voted on The constitution was passed by the House of Representatives but rejected by the Senate This is because southern voters in the Senate did not like that Kansas would become a state without slavery In 1861 after the Confederate states formed the constitution gained approval from the Union and Kansas became a state

Four months after Kansas became a state the Civil War started Out of the 381 battles in the Civil War four were fought in Kansas Throughout the war Kansas remained a Union state 

On August 21 1863 William Clarke Quantrill led a force of 300 to 400 Confederates into the town of Lawrence Kansas Quantrill and his troops burned looted and destroyed the anti slavery town This battle became known as the Lawrence Massacre In total 164 Union soldiers and 40 Confederate soldiers died in the Lawrence Massacre In the Battle of Mine Creek on October 25 1864 Union soldiers attacked Confederates as they were crossing the Mine Creek The Union surrounded the Confederates and captured 600 men and two generals 1000 Confederate soldiers and 100 Union soldiers died in the battle In total 8500 people from Kansas died or were wounded in the Civil War

After the Civil War many free slaves came to Oklahoma and Kansas In fact between the years of 1879 and 1881 about 60000 African Americans came to this region This is because the slaves wanted economic opportunities which they believed awaited them in Kansas African Americans also came to Kansas for better political rights and to escape sharecropping

From 1930 to 1936 Kansas went through a period of time called the Dust Bowl During this time Kansas had little rainfall and high temperatures Thousands of farmers became very poor and and had to move to other parts of the United States In total 400000 people left the Great Plains area The years from 1930 to 1940 was the only time the population of Kansas went down The number of people living in Kansas decreased 43 percent

During the 1950s school segregation was required in fifteen US states However Kansas was not one of these states Instead school segregation was permitted by local option but only in elementary schools In 1896 the ruling from Plessy v Ferguson stated that segregation was allowed but equal facilities should be made available for blacks and whites Often however black schools received less funding and had fewer textbooks than white schools

For these reasons Linda Brown and her family sued the Board of Education of Topeka Kansas Brown won the case and the ruling was to overturn the Plessy v Ferguson decision This was considered by many a landmark case in the Civil Rights movement

Kansas is the 15th largest state in the United States It covers an area of 82282 square miles Of this about 462 square miles are water This makes up 060 of the total area of the state

Kansas is one of six states on the Frontier Strip Kansas shares borders with Nebraska to the north Oklahoma to the south Missouri to the east and Colorado to the west 

Kansas increases in elevation from east to west All of Kansas is in the Great Plains where the land is mostly flat with prairies and grasslands Eastern Kansas has hills and forests like the Flint Hills and the Osage Plains in the southeastern part of the state The highest point in the state is Mount Sunflower near the Colorado border Mount Sunflower is 4039 fttall The lowest point is the Verdigris River in Montgomery County at 679 ft above sea level

Kansas has a varied climate with an average yearly temperature of 56F The record high in Kansas is 121F This occurred in Fredonia on July 18 1936 and in Alton on July 24 1936 The record low in Kansas is 40F This occurred in Lebanon on February 13 1905 Kansas is in a temperate area of the country Like other states in this region Kansas has four distinct seasons 

Kansas can have extreme weather in all four seasons For example in spring and autumn Kansas has many tornadoes In fact the state averages 55 tornadoes per year This is because Kansas is in the area known as Tornado Alley where cold and warm air masses come together to make severe weather

In summer Kansas has experienced severe droughts For example in 1934 1936 and 1939 Kansas had less than average rainfall and widespread dust storms as a part of the Dust Bowl

In winter Kansas has snow in most parts of the state The average snowfall in the northern half of the state is 16 inches with the average snowfall in the southern half of the state being 8 inches Blizzards and related snowstorms are rare in Kansas

Kansas had 627 cities in 2008 The largest city in Kansas is Wichita which had a population of 382368 in 2010 The other largest cities in Kansas are Overland Park 173372 Kansas City 145786 Topeka 127473 and Olathe 125872 Between the years of 2000 and 2010 the Kansas population increased 61 percent 833 percent of Kansans are Caucasian 59 percent are African American and 108 percent are another race

Farming has always been an important part of the state economy of Kansas The main crop grown in Kansas is wheat In fact Kansas farmers produce about 400 million bushels of wheat per year Kansas also ranks first in the United States in grain sorghum produced second in cropland and third in sunflowers produced However farming is not the only important part of the economy of Kansas Many parts of airplanes are made in the city of Wichita Also many important companies are located in the part of the state near Kansas City Missouri For example the Sprint Nextel Corporation is one of the largest telephone companies in the United States Its main operational offices are in Overland Park Kansas

The median household income for Kansas was 47709 in 2009 The gross domestic product for Kansas was 122700000000 in 2008 Overall Kansas GDP accounts for less than 1 percent of total US economy

The state symbols of Kansas are

James Buchanan was the 15th President of the United States He was the only President not to have married His niece Harriet Lane stood in as First Lady He was an experienced politician and he became president in 1857

During the beginning of his presidency he called slavery an issue of little importance This was clearly not the case at the time Northerners and Southerners were very divided on slavery almost to the point of war 

The Supreme Court declared that African Americans were not American citizens and that the states were allowed to keep slavery legal James Buchanan supported that decision because he did not want the pro slavery states to stop being part of the United States

Buchanan supported the rights of slave owners to keep their slaves and wanted Kansas to adopt a constitution that allowed slavery Because of that the Democratic Party was divided on that issue and after the 1858 Congressional election there were more Republicans in Congress than Democrats He did not get along with the Republicans

He ordered troops to fight against Utah based on untrue information that Utah was planning a revolt Buchanan later realized that he made a mistake and apologized

During his term the country was becoming more and more divided over the slavery issue A few months before his term ended some of the southern states decided that they were going to not be a part of the United States any more

Buchanan believed that it was a bad thing but he did nothing about it because he felt that using force against the south was against the Constitution He did not even prepare the country for war 

At the end of his term he would leave the next president Abraham Lincoln to face the greatest crisis in United States history the Civil War 

Many historians think that he is the worst US president

A hand is the body part at the end of an arm Most humans have two hands each usually with four fingers and a thumb On the inside of the hand is the palm When the fingers are all bent tightly the hand forms a fist The joints that are the hardest part of the fist are called knuckles Many other animals have hands as well mostly other primates 

The word hand is also used in card games A hand of cards is a group of cards that one player can see but others cannot

Hands are good at grabbing things

They are also good for hitting things such as people Most people use the palm of their hand for this activity

When something always does the same thing one can say that there is a rule that it does what it does

The word rule has many uses including the following

A rule in mathematics is a formula which allows a person to work out a sum if he or she has certain information For example Pythagoras theorem is a rule which states that if a person knows the lengths of two sides of a right angled triangle he or she can work out the length of the third

Rules however can also means laws created by people in power  for example school rules are the laws of a specific school

The 1910s was the decade that started on January 1 1910 and ended on December 31 1919

Neurobiology or Neuroscience is not a biological discipline exactly It is more an interdisciplinary field  This means that neurobiology is focused on the study of the nervous system but uses techniques of biochemistry physiology cell biology anatomy molecular biology and others Neurobiology looks at the brain and the nerve cells that connect to form the brain Scientists try to figure out how all of the different parts of the brain interact They also try to observe how the nerves send messages to the brain such as when a person feels pain There are many things neurobiologists study

The Kingdom of Bahrain is an island nation in the Persian Gulf Saudi Arabia is to the west and is connected to Bahrain by the King Fahd Causeway and Qatar is to the south across the Persian Gulf The Qatar Bahrain Friendship Bridge not yet built will link Bahrain to Qatar as the longest fixed bridge in the world

Humans have lived in Bahrain before there was writing It has been ruled and influenced by the Assyrians Babylonians Greeks Persians and the Arabs who made the island Muslim Bahrain was in old times known as Dilmun Tylos Awal and Mishmahig

The islands of Bahrain set in the middle south of the Persian Gulf have attracted many invaders in history The word Bahrain Two Seas means that the islands contain two kinds of water sweet water springs and salty water in the sea

A location between East and West fertile lands fresh water and pearls made Bahrain important in history About 2300 BC Bahrain started trading with Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley It was then called Delmon and was linked to the Sumerian Civilization about 2000 BC Bahrain also became part of the Babylonian empire about 600 BC Historical records called Bahrain the Life of Eternity Paradise the Pearl of the Persian Gulf and other names

Until 1521 Bahrian also ruled Ahsa and Qatif and Awal The country had all of the land from what is now Kuwait to Oman This was called Iqlim Al Bahrain In 1521 the Portuguese took Awal from the rest and since then the name of Bahrain only means todays Bahrain

The modern history of Bahrain begins with Great Britain exploring the area trying to keep Iran from taking more land The British gave support to the Al Khalifa family who made a power base in the island and allied with the British to keep the island from Iran The British got free passage to the Persian Gulf through this agreement In November of 1957 the Iranian parliament declared that Bahrain was the Fourteenth Province of Iran Later the British would become involved in the politics of Bahrain by choosing an Emir of the island Iran and Britain later agreed that the United Nations Secretary General would judge the political situation in Bahrain In a Plebiscite to decide the countrys future the majority of the people of Bahrain chose to reject Irans claims and to define their country and their culture to be Arabic and not Persian  

Oil was found in the early 20th century and brought modern improvements to the country Relations with the United Kingdom also became closer and the British brought more military bases to the nation British influence grew until Charles Belgrave became an advisor Belgrave brought modern education to Bahrain 

After World War II anti British feeling spread through the Arab world and led to riots in Bahrain The British left Bahrain in 1971 making it an independent country The sales of more oil in the 1980s brought money to Bahrain but even when the sales of oil decreased in later years it did not cause as many problems in Bahrain as in other oil countries because the economy of Bahrain had grown into other areas

In 1973 the election of first parliament was done but the government stopped dissociate the parliament in 1975 which result in strong protests by the Bahraini opposition 

In 1994 many highly educated Bahraini people signed a letter to Prince of Bahrain at that time Shiekh Isa Bin Salman Alkhalifa to re establish the parliament life which is strongly refused the leader of the opposition at that time Sheikh Abdulamir Aljamri was jailed then a huge protest conflicts occurs between Bahraini nation the armed forces

In 1999 Sheikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa followed his father as head of state and called for elections for parliament to resolve the congestion that occurred over that last period The women were given the right to vote and the new ruler released all political prisoners in 2001

In 2002 the King released a new constitution without any voting from the nation canceled 1973 constitution which caused strong refuse from the most of nation parties opposition The situations became worse later some of political activists were jailed like Abdulhadi Al Khuwajah Hassan Mushaimaa Mohammed Habib Almuqdad

Many political websites that refused these changes were blocked like Bahrain online forum wwwbahrainonlineorg Until 2009 there were many riots conflicts especially from Shia group which faces a huge organized discrimination according to Human Rights Watch US Congress

Bahrain is a constitutional monarchy ruled by the King Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa the head of government is the Prime Minister Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa He has a cabinet of 15 members Bahrain has a bicameral legislature with a lower house the Chamber of Deputies elected by all of the people and the upper house the Shura Council appointed by the King Both houses have forty members The first elections were held in 2002 with Members of Parliament serving four year terms 

Women were given the right to vote and stand in national elections for the first time in 2002s election but no women were elected to office that year and Shia and Sunni Islamists won a majority of seats Because no women were elected six were appointed to the Shura Council which also includes members of the Kingdoms Jewish and Christian people 

The King recently created the Supreme Judicial Council to organise the countrys courts and the government offices

Bahrain is split into five governorates Until July 3 2003 it was divided into twelve municipalities see Municipalities of Bahrain

For further information see Decree Law establishing governorates from the Bahrain official website

In Bahrain petroleum producing and processing is about 60 of the money from export 60 of government money and 30 of Gross Domestic Product The economy has changed as the sales of oil have changed since 1985 for example during and after the Persian Gulf War of 1990  1991 Bahrain has high quality communications and transport and so the country is home to many international companies with business in the Persian Gulf A large part of the countrys income comes from petroleum products made from imported crude oil There are several major industrial projects being built Unemployment especially among young people and the decrease of both oil and water resources are major economic problems

Bahrain is a flat and dry archipelago with a low desert plain rising gently to a low central hill in the Arabian Gulf east of Saudi Arabia The highest point is the 122 meter Jabal ad Dukhan

Bahrain has a total area of 620 km which is a few square kilometres larger than the Isle of Man As an archipelago of 33 islands Bahrain does not share a land border with any other country but it does have a 161 km coast line and claims a further 12 nm of territorial sea and a 24 nm contiguous zone Bahrain enjoys mild winters and has very hot humid summers

Bahrains natural resources include large amounts of oil natural gas as well as fish Only 1 of the country includes land where crops can be grown 92 of Bahrain is desert and droughts and dust storms are the main natural dangers  

Environmental problems in Bahrain include desertification which is causing the land where crops can be grown to decrease and damage to coast lines coral reefs and sea vegetation caused by oil spills from large tankers and oil refineries

The official religion of Bahrain is Islam most of the people are Shia and Sunni Muslims but there are also small Jewish and Christian minorities Most Bahrainis are Arabs although some tribes came from Persia Today many of the people in Bahrain are guest workers who come from Iran South Asia and Southeast Asia A Financial Times article from 31 May 1983 found that Bahrain is a polyglot state both religiously and racially Leaving aside the temporary immigrants of the past 10 years there are at least eight or nine communities on the island

The present communities may be classified as Al Khalifa Arab tribes allied to Al Khalifa the Baharnah the Howilla Sunni Arabs Ajam Indians who traded with Bahrain and settled before the age of oil a tiny Jewish community and a group which contains everyone else

Manama Bahrains capital city is as modern as other cities in the world But life in the islands many villages remains traditional Where there is tradition in the Persian Gulf area there is Islamic conservatism women cover themselves from head to foot and women travellers are expected to wear long skirts and one piece bathing suits Bahrains population is 85 Muslim and Islam is the state religion Arabic is the official language but many people speak English

Traditional folk art continues in several places around Bahrain dhows are built near Manama and Muharraq cloth is made at Bani Jamrah and pottery is made at Aali A few goldsmiths still work in the Manama souk though much of the work is now done in other countries One of the important parts of Bahraini culture is the drinking of traditional Arabian coffee  Traditional Arabian street food like shawarma and desserts such as baklava are also found

Bahrain is the home of Formula One racing in the Middle East hosting the Bahrain Grand Prix

William Christopher was born on October 20 1932 in Evanston Illinois He is an American actor He is most well known for playing Father Mulcahy on the television series MASH He also played Private Lester Hummel on Gomer Pyle USMC His wifes name is Barbara OConnor together they wrote a book Mixed Blessings about their experiences raising their autistic son

Boxers shorts are mens underwear They are shorts with a stretchy band and named after the shorts worn by boxers

They were first made in the 1930s but did not begin to be popular until 1947 These days briefs are sold more than boxer shorts

Some boxer shorts have openings with a snap button for using the toilet Others just have an elastic waistband and can be pulled on or off like briefs They can be made in different colors or patterns Television displays more men in boxer shorts than in other underwear

A CD player is a device that can read the data on a CD make it into binary information and turn that into sound waves

A CD player has a laser and an optical sensor A CD has tracks and bumps on the tracks The CD player passes a laser beam along the track of the CD The areas that are reflected are 1s to the player and the areas that are reflected are 0s to the player The CD player uses these 1s and 0s and turn them into sound waves which are made louder into speakers or earheadphones so you can listen to your music or sound recordings

Fluid Dynamics talks about how fluids work It is one of the oldest parts of the study of Physics and is studied by physicists mathematicians and engineers Mathematics can describe how fluids move using mathematical formulas called equations 

Understanding how fluids behave helps us understand things like flight weather and Sports Science For example fluid dynamics can be used to understand the weather because clouds and air are both fluids Fluid dynamics can also be used to understand how airplanes fly through the air or how ships and submarines move through water

Computer programs can use the mathematical equations of fluid dynamics to model and predict the actions of moving fluids Computers have helped us understand fluid dynamics very much and some people study how to model or simulate fluids only with a computer Studying how fluid dynamics can be done with computers is called computational fluid dynamics

The mathematical equations that govern fluid flow are simple to think about but very hard to solve In most real life cases there is no way to get an solution that can be written down and a computer must be used to calculate the answer instead There are three fundamental equations based on three principles

Conservation of mass mass is neither created nor destroyed it simply moves from one place to another This gives the mass conservation equation Sometimes this may not apply such as a flow involving a chemical reaction

Conservation of energy this is the first law of thermodynamics energy is never created or destroyed it just changes form or moves around

Conservation of momentum this is Newtons Second Law and it states that Force rate of change of momentum Momentum is mass times velocity The momentum equations are the equations that make it hard to solve problems in fluid dynamics There are a number of different versions that include a number of different effects The Navier Stokes equations are momentum equations and the Euler equations are the Navier Stokes equations but with viscosity not included There is one momentum equation in a 1D problem and three one in each space direction in 3D

To solve the equations more information is often needed in the form of an equation of state This relates thermodynamic properties to each other for a specific type of fluid An example is the Ideal Gas equation of state that relates pressure temperature and density and works well for gases under normal pressures

Ernest Miller Hemingway was an American writer generally considered to be a member of the Lost Generation Some people say that of the many people he created in his books the author himself was his best creation

Ernest Hemingway was born in 1899 He grew up in Oak Park Illinois near the midwestern city of Chicago He was the second child in a family of six His father was a doctor His mother was a painter and a pianist

Each summer the family travelled to their holiday home in northern Michigan Ernests father taught him how to catch fish hunt set up a camp and cook over a fire

At home in Oak Park Ernest wrote for his school newspaper He tried to write like a famous sports writer Ring Lardner and he made his writing skills better

In 1917 Hemingway decided not to go to a university The United States had just entered World War I and he wanted to join the Army but they rejected him because his eyesight was not good enough

Ernest found a job with the Kansas City Star newspaper in Kansas City Missouri He reported news that happened at the hospital police headquarters and the railroad station One reporter said Hemingway liked to be where the action was

The Kansas City Star told its reporters to write short sentences and to report unusual details of an incident Hemingway quickly learned to do both

Hemingway worked for the newspaper for nine months He then joined the Red Cross to help on the battle fields of Europe His job was to drive an ambulance and to take wounded soldiers off the battlefield

The Red Cross sent him to Italy There he soon saw the first wounded This was when a weapons factory in Milan exploded Later he was sent to the battle front He went close to the fighting to see how he could act in the face of danger Soon he was seriously wounded

Soon after healing the war ended Hemingway returned to the United States After less than a year he had changed forever he needed to write about what he had seen Hemingway wrote many short stories about people who experienced World War I

Some time later Hemingway left home for Chicago to prove to himself and to his family that he could earn a living from his writing

But he ran out of money and began to write for a newspaper again The Canadian newspaper the Toronto Star loved his reports in Chicago They hired him and paid him well

In Chicago Hemingway also met Sherwood Anderson Anderson was one of the first American writers to write about common people Hemingway saw that Andersons stories showed life as it really was This was similar to what he wanted to do

Anderson gave Hemingway advice about his writing He told Hemingway to move to Paris Life was less costly there Anderson said that Paris had many young artists and writers from many nations

In return for Andersons kindness Hemingway wrote a book called The Torrents of Spring It makes fun of his friend and the way he wrote Hemingway felt he could not say thank you to anyone He had to believe he did everything for himself even when he knew others helped him

Hemingway decided to move to Paris Before he did in America he married a woman he had recently met Her name was Hadley Richardson

Paris was cold and grey when Hemingway and his new wife arrived in 1921 They lived in one of the poorer parts of the city Their rooms were small and they did not have water from pipes But the Toronto Star employed him as its European reporter so they had enough money for the two of them to live That job gave Hemingway time to write his stories

Hemingway enjoyed exploring Paris learning French customs and meeting friends Some of these new friends were artists and writers who had come to the city in the 1920s Among them were poet Ezra Pound and writers Gertrude Stein John Dos Passos and F Scott Fitzgerald Seeing that Hemingway was a good writer they helped him publish his stories in the United States He was thankful for their support at the time but later denied that he had received their help

Hemingway travelled all over Europe He wrote about politics peace conferences and border disputes as well as sports skiing and fishing Later he would write about bullfighting in Spain The Toronto Star was pleased with his work and wanted more of his reports but Hemingway was busy with his own writing

He said this Sometimes I would start a new story and could not get it going Then I would stand and look out over the roofs of Paris and think I would say to myself All you have to do is write one true sentence Write the truest sentence you know So finally I would write a true sentence and go on from there It was a wonderful feeling when I had worked well

Hemingways first book of short stories was called In Our Time One of its stories Big Two Hearted River told of the effects of war on a young man who was taking a long fishing trip in Michigan Hemingway had learned from his father when he was a boy about living in the wild

The story is about two kinds of rivers One is calm and clear and is where the young man fishes The other is a dark threatening swamp The story shows its main character trying to forget his past as well as the war He does not talk much about the war The reader learns about the young man not because Hemingway tells his readers what the man thinks but because he shows that man learning about himself Many people believe it is one of the best modern American stories of all time Because of this Big Two Hearted River is often published in collections of best writing

After the book was published in 1925 Hadley and Hemingway returned to the United States for the birth of their son after which they quickly returned to Paris

Hemingway was working on a long story He wanted to publish a novel so he would be recognized as a serious writer And he wanted the money a novel would earn

The novel was called The Sun Also Rises It is about young Americans in Europe after World War One The war had destroyed their dreams and had given them nothing to replace those dreams The writer Gertrude Stein later called these people members of The Lost Generation

The book was an immediate success At the age of 25 Ernest Hemingway was famous Many people however did not like Hemingways art because they did not like what he wrote about

Hemingways sentences were short the way he had been taught to write at the Kansas city star newspaper He wrote about what he knew and felt He used few descriptive words His statements were clear and easily understood

He had learned from earlier writers like Ring Lardner and Sherwood Anderson but Hemingway brought something new to his writing He was able to paint in words what he saw and felt In later books sometimes he missed Sometimes he even looked foolish But when he was right he was almost perfect

With the success of his novel Hemingway became even more popular in Paris Many people came to see him One was an American woman Pauline Pfeiffer She became Hadleys friend Then Pauline fell in love with Hemingway

Hemingway and Pauline saw each other secretly One time they went away together on a short trip Years later Hemingway wrote about returning home after that trip

When I saw Hadley again I wished I had died before I ever loved anyone but her She was smiling and the sun was on her lovely face 

But the marriage was over Ernest Hemingway and Hadley separated She kept their son He agreed to give her money he earned from his books

In later years he looked back at his marriage to Hadley as the happiest time of his life

At twenty five Hemingway was living in Paris He was a famous writer But the end of his first marriage made him want to leave the place where he had first become famous

Much later he said the city was never to be the same again When I returned to it I found it had changed as I had changed Paris was never the same as when I was poor and very happy

Hemingway and his new wife returned to the United States in 1928 They settled in Key West an island with a fishing port near the southern coast of Florida

Before leaving Paris Hemingway sent a collection of his stories to New York to be published The book of stories called Men Without Women was published soon after Hemingway arrived in Key West

One of the stories was called The Killers In it Hemingway used a discussion between two men to create a feeling of tension and coming violence This was a new method of telling a story

Nick opened the thingy and went into the room Ole Andreson was lying on the bed with all his clothes on He had been a heavyweight prizefighter and he was too long for the bed He lay with his head on two pillows He did not look at Nick

What was it He asked

I was up at Henrys Nick said and two fellows came in and tied me up and the cook and they said they were going to kill you

It sounded silly when he said it Ole Andreson said nothing they put us out in the kitchen Nick went on They were going to shoot you when you came in to supper

Ole Andreson looked at the wall and did not say anything George thought I ought to come and tell you about it

There is not anything I can do about it Ole Andreson said

Any new book by Hemingway was an important event for readers But stories like The Killers shocked many people Some thought there was too much violence in his stories Others said he only wrote about gunmen soldiers fighters and drinkers

This made Hemingway angry He felt that writers should not be judged by those who could not write a story

Hemingway was happy in Key West In the morning he wrote in the afternoon he fished and at night he went to a public house and drank One old fisherman said Hemingway was a man who talked slowly and very carefully He asked a lot of questions And he always wanted to get his information exactly right

Hemingway and his wife Pauline had a child in Key West

Soon afterwards he heard that his father had killed himself Hemingway was shocked He said My father taught me so much He was the only one I really cared about

When Hemingway returned to work there was a sadness about his writing that was not there before

His new book told about an American soldier who served with the Italian army during World War One He meets an English nurse and they fall in love They flee from the army but she dies during childbirth Some of the events are taken from Hemingways service in Italy The book is called A Farewell to Arms

Part of the book talks about the defeat of the Italian army at a place called Caporetto

At noon we were stuck in a muddy road about as nearly as we could figure ten kilometres from Udine The rain had stopped during the forenoon and three times we had heard planes coming seen them pass overhead watched them go far to the left and heard them bombing on the main highroad  

Later we were on a road that led to a river There was a long line of abandoned trucks and carts on a road leading up to a bridge No one was in sight The river was high and the bridge had been blown up in the center the stone arch was fallen into the river and the brown water was going over it We went up the bank looking for a place to cross  we did not see any troops only abandoned trucks and stores Along the river bank was nothing and no one but the wet brush and muddy ground 

A Farewell to Arms was very successful It earned Hemingway a great deal of money It permitted him to travel

One place he visited was Spain a country he loved He said I want to paint with words all the sights and sounds and smells of Spain And if I can write any of it down truly then it will represent all of Spain

He wrote a book called Death in the Afternoon It describes the Spanish custom of bull fighting Hemingway believed that bull fighting was an art just as much as writing was an art And he believed it was a true test of a mans bravery something that always concerned him

Hemingway also travelled to Africa He had been asked to write a series of reports about African hunting He said Hunting in Africa is the kind of hunting I like No riding in cars just simple walking and feeling the grass under my feet

The trip to Africa resulted in a book called The Green Hills of Africa and many smaller stories

One story is one of Hemingways best The story called The Snows of Kilimanjaro tells of Hemingways fears about himself It is about a writer who betrays his art for money and is unable to remain true to himself

In 1936 the Civil War in Spain gave him a chance to return to Spain and test his bravery again He agreed to write about the war for an American news organization

It was a dangerous job One day Hemingway and two other reporters were driving a car near a battlefield The car carried two white flags to show they were not fighting But rebel gunners thought the car was carrying enemy officers Hemingway was almost killed Later he said that bullets are all the same If they do not hit you there is no story If they do hit you then you do not have to write it 

The trip to Spain resulted in two works a play called The Fifth Column and a novel called For Whom the Bell Tolls The novel tells the story of an American who has chosen to fight against the fascists He realizes that there are lies and injustice on his side But he sees no hope except the victory of his side During the fighting he escapes his fear of death and of being alone He decides that he can live as full a life in seventy hours as in seventy years

The book was a great success Hemingway enjoyed being famous His second marriage was ending He divorced Pauline and married reporter Martha Gellhorn He had met her while they were working in Spain They decided to live in Cuba near the city of Havana Their house looked out over the Caribbean Sea

But this marriage did not last long Hemingway was changing He began to feel that whatever he said was right Martha went on long trips to be away from him He drank heavily to forget his loneliness

When America entered World War Two Hemingway went to Britain as a reporter Later he took part in the invasion of Europe and the freeing of Paris

During the war Hemingway met another reporter Mary Walsh In 1945 when his marriage to Martha was legally over he married Mary

After the war Hemingway began work on his last important book The Old Man and the Sea It is the story of a Cuban fisherman who refuses to be defeated by nature

Hemingway said I was trying to show the experience of the fisherman so exactly and directly that it became part of the readers experience

In 1954 Hemingway won the Nobel Prize for Literature But he was too sick to take part in the ceremony

Ernest Hemingway was 60 years old but he said he felt like he was 86 Even worse he felt that he no longer was able to write He seemed to be living the story about the writer who had sold his writing skill in order to make money

In 1961 Ernest Hemingway killed himself Among the papers he left was one that described what he liked best

To stay in places and to leave  to trust to distrust  to no longer believe and believe again  to watch the changes in the seasons  to be out in boats  to watch the snow come to watch it go  to hear the rain  And to know where I can find what I want

Ernest Hemingway owned many cats especially cats with extra toes Today these cats are sometimes called Hemingway cats in his honor His house in Key West Florida is now a home for his cats and their kittens

A reed is a piece of dry bamboo that is used in some musical instruments such as saxophones clarinets and oboes The musician blows air through the mouthpiece where the reed is firmly placed and the air makes the reed vibrate this vibration in the mouthpiece produces sound all along the instrument which is changed into specific musical notes depending on the physical nature of the instrument 

Musical instruments that use reeds are members of the woodwind family because many years ago the instruments were all made of wood Today the instruments can be made of metal wood or a hard plastic made to look like wood 

The bassoon family of instruments and the oboe family of instruments play with a double reed Players play through blowing air through the double reed making the reeds vibrate A mouthpiece is not needed 

Other reeds can be made from metal or plastic

Muhammad was an Arabian religious and political leader Muslims believe he was the last prophet of Allah He is believed to have been a descendant of Ishmael a son of Abraham and is considered the most important person in the religion of Islam 

Muhammad was born about April 20 570 AD in Mecca His father whose name was Abdullah died a couple of months before Muhammads birth His mother Aminah died when he was six years old and he was breastfed by a woman known as Halima as Sadiyya So his grandfather Abd al Muttalib took care of him for two years After his grandfathers death his uncle Abu Talib took care of him and was a support to him for many years of his adult life

In 610 CE when Muhammad was forty years old he walked to the cave of Hira near Makkah According to Muslims the Angel Jibrail spoke with him in the cave of the HiraWhen Muhammad first saw the angel Jibrail he fainted because Jibrail was so large Jibrail revealed to Muhammad ayahs of Surat al Alaq the first five verses of the Quran that were revealed to Muhammad

Muhammad went back home to his wife and told her what had happened New revelations came to him that said he had to preach what was being sent down from God When Muhammad first started teaching many of the people of Makkah who worshipped idols did not like the things that Muhammad said But there were also people who listened to his preaching and obeyed his messages These people were the first of the followers of the Islam Leaders of Makkah punished and tortured the followers of Islam Some followers of Islam were executed Muhammad resisted this and continued to teach Islam

After Muhammad failed in Makkah he took his message to Medina where some people learned about him and his followers They welcomed him into their city and Muhammad wanted them to convert to Islam They agreed and many of his followers went to Medina This movement from Makkah to Medina is called the Hijrah The Hijra was also the beginning of the Muslim calendar Muhammad stayed behind until all of his people left Makkah safely

As Muhammad stayed in Makkah Abu Lahab trained seven men to kill Muhammad in his sleep According to the story they did not see him leave Makkah The men went into his house and found his cousin Ali Abu Lahab and his horsemen went to the desert to look for him and his friend Abu Bakr

Muhammad and Abu Bakr arrived in Medina Some people welcomed Prophet Muhammad to their homes He used his camel to show everyone where he would build his house Also the first masjid of Medina a small place for prayer was built in the back of this house

The people in a strong Jewish tribe in Medina disagreed with the teachings and rules set by Muhammad This tribe told their allies in Makkah to sell of all the things and homes that Muslims of Makkah left behind The Muslims and those from Makkah were advised to fight for their property Prophet Muhammad told them not to do that

Muslims were called all over Medina to gather at a masjid that Prophet Muhammad prayed in They were told to fight against the people of Makkah who burned down their homes and robbed their properties Having no income the Muslims who originally came from Makkah then attacked caravans from Makkah Then in AD 624 Muhammad himself led a large group of some three hundred warriors to attack a caravan

The Quraysh pagans of Mecca heard about this and they sent a larger army numbering 1000 warriors to fight the Muslims They met in Badr but the pagans were defeated and Abu Jahl one of the pagan leaders was also killed

But the Muslims lost the second war at Uhud One year after the fight at Badr the army of Mecca had outside help Muslim archers failed to listen to Muhammads instructions and Khalid ibn al Walid cleverly took advantage of that Hamza Muhammads last uncle was killed when a slave from Mecca threw a spear into his chest Muhammad himself was injured

Then in 627 Abu Sufyan led the Quraysh and its allies to attack Medina itself However they could not pass the trench that the Muslims had dug around Medina After several weeks the coalition broke up and went home The Medinians were considered victors

After the pagans of Mecca failed to gain control of Medina the Muslims became stronger The pagans then decided to sign a truce with the Muslims This means that they would not fight each other for ten years The Muslims used this as a chance to talk to other people all over Arabia In three years many people changed their religions to Islam

But this truce did not last for long After three years of it a small group of horsemen from Mecca attacked a Muslim camp and killed a few of them The Muslims in Medina heard of this and the truce was cancelled Abu Sufyan third leader of Mecca in Muhammads lifetime tried to resume the truce but Muhammad politely refused the offer Muhammad told his followers to be ready to capture Mecca

In 630 most people in Arabia had become Muslims and they became part of Muhammads large army to capture Mecca Because of the big size of the army the people of Mecca were afraid to fight back Abu Sufyan who was feeling unhappy over the broken truce went to Muhammads camp outside Mecca to ask for forgiveness Muhammad did not say that he would forgive him so he returned back home While he was with Muhammad he changed his religion to Islam by saying the Testimony 

The next day the Muslim army walked towards Mecca Everyone ran to their homes and closed all doors and windows They were afraid that the Muslims were going to kill them because of the bad things they did to the Muslims many years ago But the Muslims went towards the Kabah believed to be built by Abraham and his elder son Ishmael Bilal ibn Ribah a former Ethiopian slave shouted out loud to the people of Mecca that they were all safe All those who lay down arms are safe All those in the house of Abu Sufyan are safe All those behind closed doors are safe

Abu Sufyan heard this in his home From this he learns that Muhammad forgave him At that time Muhammad and his followers removed and broke all idols from the Kaaba The idols were statues that were worshiped as gods Muhammad forgave all citizens of Mecca At the end Bilal climbed to the top of the Kaaba and called for prayer This was Muhammads victory in spreading Islam all over Arabia But because he was old he would not live for long

In 632 on June 8 Muhammad became very sick Before he died he told his followers about his death He is buried in the chamber of his wife Aisha in Medina where the Al Masjid al Nabiyy is In Mecca his friend Abu Bakr went to the Masjid Al Nabiyy and shouted to the people

Although Muhammad died Islam soon spread all over the Middle East Then centuries later it continued till it reached Africa Asia and Europe Islam has become one of the worlds biggest and fastest growing religions

When Muslims say or write the name of Muhammad or any other prophet in Islam they usually follow it with Peace be upon him For example Muhammad In printed matter a calligraphic symbol is frequently used instead of printing the phrase

Muslims do not make or show images of Muhammad The Quran does not state that images of Muhammad must not ever be made but it does contain passages that forbid the creation of idols There are also passages against the creation of images of God in the Hadith Many Muslims especially Sunni Muslims believe there should be no pictures of Muhammad If non Muslim people create images of Muhammad this is often seen as disrespectful

In 2005 a Danish newspaper published political cartoons of Muhammad This led to violent protests in the Arabic World and elsewhere More than 100 people died as a result of the protests Johan Galtung a Norwegian mathematician and peace activist tried to help both sides come together and talk about this According to Galtung the attacks against Danish institutions ended after the government had invited talks

The Ford Mustang is a very popular American sports car built by the Ford Motor Company beginning in 1964 The first cars were built in Fords Dearborn Michigan factory on March 9 of that year and the car was first shown to the public on April 17 at the New York Worlds Fair It did not cost a lot of money but it was still very fancy and looked like a much more expensive car People could order their Mustang with many options and body styles such as a convertible 22 or coupe Many different engines were available from the 170 CID six cylinder to some of Fords biggest and most powerful V 8 engines in later years This meant car buyers could have a Mustang that saved gas or a more powerful and fast car More than one million Mustangs were sold in only two years The Mustang is still being sold today and is still very popular It was so popular and so different when it was introduced that the Mustang and other cars from other makers which looked like the Mustang were given the name ponycar 

The so called 1964 12 Mustang was designed by Joe Oros and Dave Ash of Fords Mercury division was based on another Ford car the Falcon and was proposed by Fords president Lee Iacocca The Falcon was not expensive to build and that helped Iacocca get the Mustang the approval it needed to be built The people who ran the Ford company did not want to take a chance on a car like that because they lost a lot of money on another car the Edsel just a few years back It set sales records and became one of the best selling cars of all time It would remain mostly the same until 1966 So popular was the Mustang that three Ford assembly plants worked to build it Not only was the Mustang built in Dearborn but in Metuchen New Jersey and San Jose California as well

The very first Mustang built to be sold to the public was a white convertible with a black interior and a V 8 engine It was purchased by a pilot from Newfoundland Ford offered the one millionth Mustang to the owner in exchange for the first one That first Mustang serial number 5F08F100001 is still on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn 

Its second body style came out in 1967 its third in 1969 and its fourth in 1971 Bigger more powerful engines were offered starting in 1967 making some Mustangs into musclecars Some of those special Mustangs had special names such as Mustang GT Mach 1 Boss 302 Boss 351 Boss 429 and 429 SCJ or Super Cobra Jet By 1971 the Mustang had become a much larger car The car grew in size so that Ford could put its biggest engines in it but insurance companies were charging very high prices to insure powerful cars and sales began to drop Many people missed the original smaller Mustang

A new Mustang came out in 1974 called Mustang II and was based on the Ford Pinto although far less than the original car had been based on the Falcon This new car was almost the same size as the original car but emissions controls and the Arab oil embargo meant that the Mustang II was not a very powerful car 1974 was not only the first time Ford had built a car which looked like an older model it was also the first American car to be built on the metric system The short low hood meant that neither the inline six cylinder engine nor V 8 would fit so engine choices were changed to a 23 liter four cylinder engine built by Ford in Brazil and a more expensive V 6 engine built by Ford in Germany A 50 liter V 8 engine was offered in 1975 which meant that Ford engineers had to redesign much of the car to make it fit No matter which engine was used the Mustang II was a heavier car than the 1964 66 model

The Mustang II helped keep the ponycar alive between 1974 and 1978 General Motors almost stopped building their popular Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird Chrysler Corporation stopped building the Dodge Challenger and Plymouth Barracuda during that time General Motors stopped building the Camaro in 2002 but they brought back a new version in 2009 Chrysler brought back a new Challenger in 2008 as well they like todays Mustang are made to look like older models

The new Mustang that came out in 1979 may have been the most important Mustang ever One reason was the return of a powerful V 8 in 1982 which was developed in later years into an even more powerful engine The basic design carried all the way through the 2004 model year but with hundreds of thousands of improvements over the years Very few parts except for some minor chassis parts stayed unchanged

The 2005 model was the first all new Mustang since 1979 Because the original Mustang was and is one of the most popular cars ever Ford made the new Mustang to look very much like the first Mustangs especially the 1967 and 1968 models The 2010 Mustang in turn looks much like the 2005 09 model but all the body parts except for the roof are different The rear turn signals of the 2005 2010 cars blink in a one two three sequence like the 1967 68 Mercury Cougar and 1964 66 Ford Thunderbird

Both Ford and Carroll Shelby recently brought back the a new version of the very fast Shelby GT 500 Mustang Mr Shelby helped create the special Shelby GT 350 and GT 500 versions of the Mustang beginning in 1965

Starting in 2011 the Mustang GT will get a new 50 liter engine which will take the place of the 46 liter engine This new engine will put out 412 horsepower making it among the most powerful Mustangs ever  

Red Hat Linux is a discontinued Linux operating system replaced by RHEL

Red Hat made it public in the past and it was used by many Linux users The last publicly released version was Red Hat Linux 9 in April 2003 Red Hat then decided to discontinue a future release of Red Hat Linux and started the paid Red Hat Enterprise Linux instead There are some redistributions of RHEL though such as CentOS which are free and come without Red Hats branding logos etc due to trademark restrictions

Red Hat Linux 73 version is still widely used around the world for servers and workstations

Around 2005 The Red Hat company released their system as Fedora Core intended to be a test platform for new technologies It is now called just Fedora and its present release acts as a base for the next release of RHEL

A shooter is a kind of video game The aim of the game is to beat enemies by shooting them The enemies shoot back The aim of the game is to stay alive as long as possible

Many of the oldest computer games were shooters the first video game ever made was a shooter called Computer Space And one of the first games that many people played was a shooter called Space Invaders 

There are lots of different kinds of shooter Now many people like first person shooters But there are other kinds too In Japan many people play shooters where the enemies fire lots of bullets The bullets make beautiful patterns on the screen This kind of shooter is called a barrage shooter or a curtain fire shooter It is also called by the Japanese name danmaku

Sushi is made with specially prepared rice generally mixed with vinegar salt and sugar Sushi also contains raw or cooked seafood although sometimes it may include vegetables as well Sometimes sushi is wrapped in a sheet of seaweed called nori

There are many different kinds of sushi The most common sushi you will find in Japan is nigirizushi fish that is placed on top of a small portion of sushi rice Sometimes you may find other ingredients on top of rice such as egg instead of fish Makizushi consists of rice rolled around fish andor vegetables In America makizushi has become very popular more so than nigirizushi Another type is known as temaki or a hand roll This kind of sushi comes in a cone shape created by the nori wrapped around the ingredients inside They are usually filled with a mixture of rice fish and vegetables

Sushi can be eaten with hands or chopsticks Soy sauce and wasabi are commonly eaten with sushi Gari can often be found alongside a plate of sushi used as a palate cleanser

In Japan sushi is sometimes sold in conveyor belt shops called kaiten zushi where plates of sushi are put on a moving belt that passes by the customers People freely take the sushi they want as it passes The color of the plate shows the price of the sushi This way of serving sushi is becoming more popular in other countries as well

As with most foods eating sushi has some health risks However most can be minimized with proper preparation Some large fish such as tuna can contain high levels of mercury ions Tuna can cause mercury poisoning when consumed in very large quantities over time Parasite infection by raw fish is not common in the modern world Infections can generally be avoided by boiling burning preserving in salt or vinegar or freezing to a certain temperature Although nigirizushi will almost always appear in a raw form often much of the fish has been previously frozen to specific temperatures to prevent parasites

The Thinker is a famous bronze statue made by the sculptor Auguste Rodin which portrays a man sitting and thinking with his arms bent on his knee and his chin on his hand Though this statue is widely known as The Thinker Rodin first called it The Poet It was part of a commission by the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris to create a huge gate based on the epic poem The Divine Comedy of Dante Each of the statues in the piece represented one of the main characters in the poem The Thinker was originally meant to depict Dante himself in front of the Gates of Hell considering his great poem

Over twenty casts of the sculpture exist they are now in museums around the world Some of those copies are enlarged versions of the original work while others have somewhat different proportions

The Thinker was finished in 1902

Nazko Cone is a small volcano in central British Columbia Canada It is approximately 75 km west of the town of Quesnel It is in the eastern part of the Anahim Volcanic Belt The most recent eruption of Nazko Cone was 7200 years ago

A series of small earthquakes occurred in the area of Nazko Cone beginning on October 10 2007 Most of these earthquakes were magnitude 10 or less some as strong as magnitude 32 were centered 25 kilometers below the surface The cause of these earthquakes is believed to be the rising of molten magma because there are no faults or tectonic plate boundaries The source of this magma is from the Anahim hotspot and continues to this day

The Anahim Volcanic Belt is a nearly east west line of volcanoes stretches from the west coast of British Columbia Canada just north of Vancouver Island and reaches into the Interior Plateau near Quesnel The farther away from the coast the younger the volcanoes tend to be These volcanoes are thought to have formed because of the North American continent sliding westward over the Anahim hotspot Volcanoes in this belt include the Rainbow Ilgachuz and Itcha Ranges and the Nazko Cone which last erupted about 7200 years ago

Chilcotin Plateau Basalts is an area in British Columbia of small flows of melted rock called lava or magma about 150 km from the ocean They go in the same direction as the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt These flows are thought to be a result of the crust getting bigger behind an area where one block of land slides under another This happens a lot in lots of place and is called back arc extension volcanism Most volcanoes near Chilcotin blew out lava or erupted 6 to 10 million years before now and 2 to 3 million years before now while the eruptions in the Garibaldi volcanic belt were just beginning There have also been some eruptions not very long ago in a time called the Pleistocene epoch

The Garibaldi Volcanic Belt is the northern extension of the Cascade Volcanic Belt in the northwestern United States and contains the most explosive eruptions in Canada Its volcanoes are also the closest to British Columbias densely populated southwest corner These volcanoes are the result of subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate the plates meet just seaward of the west coast of Vancouver Island The volcanoes of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt generally are stratovolcanoes typical of subduction zones and include Mount Garibaldi Mount Cayley and Mount Meager Meagers eruption 2350 years ago is the youngest explosive eruption in Canada It was similar to that of Mount St Helens in 1980 and the ongoing eruption of Montserrat in the Caribbean

Mount Garibaldi is an eroded dacitic strato volcano in southwestern British Columbia Both Garibaldi and Mount Baker to its south are part of the Cascade volcanic arc Mount Garibaldi 80 km due north of Vancouver is made up of Mount Garibaldi Atwell Peakand Dalton Dome This Pleistocene volcanic center is part of a volcanic field that contains some 13 vents in an area 30 km long by 15 km wide much of which is in Garibaldi Provincial Park 

The eruptive history of Mt Garibaldi involves an initial period of volcanism followed by a period of quiescence Renewed activity in the last 50000 years has rebuilt the edifice in a series of violent eruptions like when Mount Pelee erupted in 1902 and destroyed the town of St Pierre on the island of Martinique As successive pyroclastic flows travelled down the mountains gentle slopes and were deposited the volcano took on a broad conical form Part of the volcanos southwest flank built out onto thick glacial ice filling the Squamish River valley Subsequent rapid melting of the ice at the close of the last ice age removed support from the western part of the cone The volcano collapsedproducing much of the existing rugged topography of Mount Garibaldi and Atwell Peak This catastrophic failure left a scarp on which is exposed the internal structure of the volcano and a debris fan with an estimated volume of 150000000 m at the foot of the mountain north of the town of Squamish As valley glaciers retreated two lava flows erupted Clinker Peak immediately north of Mt Garibaldi The northernmost Rubble Creek flow was party confined by a wall of ice resulting in a lava flow over 244m thick The steep northern edge of the Rubble Creek flow party collapsed several times most recently in 1855 1856 the village of Garibaldi was abandoned because of the danger of future collapses The most recent period of activity occurred shortly after the disappearance of the glacial ice filling the valley 10700 to 9300 radiocarbon years ago and ended with the eruption the Ring Creek lava flow from Opal cone on Garibaldis southeastern flank

The Ring Creek flow is very unusual It is 15 km long  a length usually only attained by basalt flowsexcept that the Ring Creek flow is dacite Renewed volcanism in the Garibaldi area would pose a serious threat to the local communities of Whistler and Squamish Although no Plinian style eruptions are known even Pelean type eruptions could produce large quantities of ash that could rise to several hundred meters above the volcano whose close proximity to Vancouver would make this a hazard for air traffic The danger from lava flows would be low to moderate because the nature of the lavas would prevent them from travelling far from their sourceeven though the Ring Creek lava flow ends only 6 km from Squamish Melting of remnant glacial ice capping the Mt Garibaldi area could produce floods laharsor debris flows that might endanger small communities including Brackendale

Highway 99 which links Whistler and Squamish with Vancouver is already plagued by landslides and dedris flows from the precipitous Coast Mountains An eruption producing floods could destroy segments of the highway Flooding and debris flows could also have serious coneequences for the salmon fishery on the Squamish Cheakamus and Mamquam rivers In additionexplosive eruptions and the accompanying ash could cause short and long term water supply problems for Vancouver and much of the lower mainland The catchment area for the Greater Vancouver watershed is downwind from the Garibaldi area Air fall material could also have a deleterious effect on the ice fields to the east of Mt Garibaldi causing increased melting and spring flooding This in turn could theaten water supplies from Pitt Lake as well as fisheries on the Pitt River

Mount Meager is a potentially active volcano in the Canadian province of British Columbia Canada 150 kilometers north of Vancouver The top of the mountain is mostly covered by snow and glaciers It lies in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and is the northernmost volcano of the Cascade Volcanic Arc that extends down to northern California Its most common type of rock is lava that is almost a million years old 

The mountain is part of the Pacific Ranges of mountains and is 2680 meters high It was previously called Cathedral Mountain

Meager is known for its last major eruption about 2350 years ago The strange thing about the eruption was the fact it released the debris from the northeast side of the volcano as rock and ash blocked a major river called the Lillooet River The river was dammed to a height of at least 100 meters forming a lake The lake reached a maximum elevation of 810 meters and was at least 50 meters deep The breccia soon eroded from water activity within the lake forming Keyhole Falls There was a massive flood when the water first broke through the breccia carrying small house sized blocks of breccia During this eruption ash was hurled into the air over 20 kilometers above sea level The ash was carried westward as far as Alberta

Meager is an unstable volcano It is built of unstable volcanic and has dumped clay and rock several meters deep into the Perberton Valley at least three times during the last 7300 years Two earlier debris flows around 4450 and 7300 years ago sent rubble at least 32 kilometers from the volcano Recently the volcano has created smaller landslides about every ten years including one in 1975 that killed four geologists near Meager Creek Logging mining tourism and wilderness recreation on nearby slopes and valleys are vulnerable to the volcanos excellent geomorphic activity The possibility of Mount Meager covering settled parts of the Pemberton Valley in a debris flow is estimated at about one in 2400 years There is no sign of volcanic eruptions with these events however scientists warn the volcano could release another massive debris flow over populated areas anytime without warning 

The explosive nature of past eruptions at Mount Meager indicates that this volcano also poses a considerable long distance treat to communities across southern British Columbia and Alberta It is also a local treat to the town of Pemberton British Columbia about 50km away Another explosive eruption at Mount Meager would also have a considerable impact on local mining and logging operations as well as significant negative impacts on the Lillooet River fishery

Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy and is the study of the world It is the basis of physics and other sciences However unlike other sciences metaphysics asks very basic philosophical questions and does not look at the world directly

A physicist might ask how does the world work but a metaphysical philosopher would ask what is the world Often metaphysical questions are questions about ourselves and how we see and feel the world They can also be questions about what might be true and what could not be true By answering these questions metaphysical philosophers hope they can understand the world in a way that people who do not ask them cannot Many metaphysical philosophers are also physicists such as Aristotle and Rene Descartes

In some areas metaphysical philosophers can ask questions and find answers but physicists cannot such as the study of time or God In other areas metaphysics is not very useful such as finding out what things are made of

Edgar Cayce known as The Sleeping Prophet and Americas Greatest Mystic is one of Americas famous psychics He wanted people to think of him as a healer and not a psychic 

Cayce worked in a trance This means he could talk while sleeping and answered questions about a persons health past and future This information is called readings At first these readings were about the physical health of the person Later there were readings on past lives business advice dream interpretation and also mental or spiritual health The Association for Research and Enlightenment currently takes care of all of his readings and follow ups to the readings The readings have had a large effect on New Age thinking

Edgar Cayce was born on March 181877 near Hopkinsville Kentucky He read the Bible many times starting when he was 10 years old He wanted to tell people about God and heal them His family worked on a farm

His family moved to Hopkinville in December 1893 Edgars first jobs were at Richards Dry Goods Store He next worked in Hoppers Bookstore Both stores were located on Main Street He married Gertrude Evans in 1903

In 1900 Cayce went into business with his father They sold insurance Cayce became very sick with laryngitis in March In April 18 he could not talk at all He had to live at home with his parents for almost a year He become a photographer because it did not require talking He worked in the photography studio of W R Bowles in Hopkinsville

A hypnotist and entertainer called Hart was entertaining at the Hopkinsville Opera House in 1901 He heard that Cayce was sick and asked if he could try to cure him Cayce said yes and the entertainer tried to cure Cayce in front of an audience Cayce was able to talk while in a hypnotic trance but when he woke up he could not talk Hart hypnotized Cayce so that his voice would be normal after the trance but Cayces voice did not become normal

Hart had to leave Another hypnotist Al Layne continued to help Cayce have a normal voice Layne asked Cayce to tell him the cause of his illness and its cure while in a hypnosis Cayce described his illness from a first person plural point of view we instead of the singular I In later readings he would usually start off with We have the body In the reading Cayce said his voice loss was because of psychological paralysis and that could be fixed by increasing the blood flow to the voice box Layne suggested that the blood flow be increased and Cayces face turned red with blood and his chest area turned bright red After 20 minutes Cayce still in trance said the treatment over When he woke up his voice stayed normal He would get sick again and but was cured by Layne in the same way and later he was cured perfectly

Cayces work grew as his fame grew He asked for people to give him money to support himself and his family so that he could work full time He continued to work in a trance state with a hypnotist all his life His wife and oldest son later replaced Layne in this role A secretary Gladys Davis took notes Many believe that Cayce had an affair with Ms Davis later in life  but a medical examination conducted after Cayces death to treat Daviss uterine cancer allegedly showed that she was still a virgin at that time

In 1929 the Cayce hospital was created in Virginia Beach The cost of the hospital was paid for by Morton Blumenthal

Cayce became famous in the United States in 1943 because of an article in Coronet magazine He increased his readings to 8 times a day to try to keep up This caused problems with his health

The trance reading caused problems with Cayces health which were easily seen On the times when he could not give a clear reading he said it was because he was working under too great a pressure In these cases he always gave the money back to the person he was giving a reading to

Edgar Cayce died on January 3 1945 He had predicted his own death four days earlier

Edgar Cayce is famous for the thousands of readings that he gave while he was hypnotized He gave more than 14000 readings in 43 years Gladys Davis his assistant recorded the readings and his wife Gertrude Evans Cayce guided him during hypnosis 

In the beginning his readings were known as physical readings Cayce often called the body the organism Cayce would put himself under self hypnosis While he seemed to sleep he would say where the person was He would sometimes name the streets along the way He would then say Yes we see the body and describe the clients organ circulatory and nervous systems He would give reasons for illness or problems A message would then be given to the person telling them how to get better The readings were so specialized that treatments were often changed or not even given if the person would not follow his advice People often came to Cayce for health readings when the medical community could find nothing wrong or had given up on them

In a life reading Cayce described the past lives of the client These readings described the clients present physical emotional and mental condition in terms of past life experience Cayce was not above flattering his clients by describing past lives as royalty famous people or people at their spiritual highest 

For those people whose intentions Cayce believed to be pure Cayce would give business readings These included advice on business partners the stock market and business models Cayce also founded and guided the ARE

Edgar Cayce encouraged everyone to interpret and use his or her own dreams in day to day life A dream reading involved Cayce interpreting the dreams of clients As he did with readings on many subjects Cayce would often interrupt the person reading the dream and give an interpretation before the dream had been completely read He would sometimes fill in parts of dreams that the dreamer had supposedly forgotten Unlike Jungian or Freudian dream interpretation Cayce did not emphasize highly the importance of symbols He said that every individual has his or her own unique symbols Cayce claimed that in dreams people could receive valuable insight into their own lives and that the insight was always of use to the dreamer Besides regular daily insight into ones life he claimed people could communicate with loved ones dead or alive remember past life experiences see a possible future and experience many other psychic phenomena He stated that these paranormal abilities were something anyone could learn

These readings were often short and were Cayces favorite type of reading when not in his supposed trance state They focused on what a individual could do to achieve a better mentalspiritual life 

Other Readings are miscellaneous subject matter that does not fit into an above category The subject matter differs from missing persons buried treasure readings given to a spiritual development group psychic abilities auras prophecy structure of reality geology and many other topics

For many people the readings had a powerful impact on attitudes beliefs health practices outlook on life matters of faith and many other areas

Abilities that have been claimed for Cayce include

Cayce himself did not claim to be able to do all these things

Cayce had difficulty and believing some of the things he said when he was hypnotised For example having been raised a devout Christian for a long time he could not believe that reincarnation was real Books such as Frederick Olivers A Dweller On Two Planets and Marie Corellis novels were probably easily accessible to Cayce at his bookstore Corellis writings in particular seek to reconcile mystical beliefs such as reincarnation with Christianity and Cayce may have been subconsciously trying to accept this idea

Cayce also claimed while in a supposed trance that the Essenes had believed in reincarnation but that view was expunged from the Bible following a papal council decision in around 500 AD Essene belief in reincarnation is debatable as with ancient Egyptian religion

During a hypnosis session Cayce mentioned a former life as Ra Ta an Egyptian healer priest He told a long story about working with the legendary doctor magician Hermes Thoth who he said was reincarnated as Jesus Cayce also specified that Jesus had lived a number of incarnations throughout human history

One of Cayces trance statements implies that knowledge gained through his readings is not necessary if a person is well grounded in ones faith Does it make one a better husband a better businessman a better neighbor a better artist a better churchman if so cleave to it if not reject it 

The readings also warn against the misuse of religion for personal gain God is not mocked is an often quoted verse in the readings

Many skeptics say that Cayce did not have paranormal abilities Cayce himself said that not all the information given during readings was correct and should be analyzed He criticized his own organization the ARE on a number of occasions for not doing enough research on the validity of the readings

In addition although Cayces secretary Miss Davis allegedly took down what Cayce said the records of the readings are jumbled and chaotic There is nothing to distinguish what Cayce himself independently said what was the information provided in the letters and what his handlers physicians osteopaths and hypnotists told him Thus researchers cannot say that Cayce ever made an accurate diagnosis without knowing anything about the person at the other end What is known is that by the time he got some of the letters the client had already died Yet Cayce went on with his reading for the individual as though still alive

Critics also cite the vagueness of his language while in his supposed trance state Martin Gardner gives several examples of this including a reading Cayce did for his own wife who had tuberculosis

From the head pains along through the body from the second fifth and sixth dorsals and from the first and second lumbar tie ups here floating lesions or lateral lesions in the muscular and nerve fibers which supply the lower end of the lung and the diaphragm in conjunction with the sympathetic nerve of the solar plexus coming in conjunction with the solar plexus at the end of the stomach

Cayce used the word lung and this his followers take as a correct diagnosis ie a psychic hit This technique is called shotgunning Mrs Cayce subsequently died of her illness

Many of his health readings prescribed cures with ingredients that did not exist Others were folk remedies some well known to todays herbalists and naturopaths but Cayce would sometimes describe them using terms that had fallen out of general use Still other ingredients were completely unknown to either physicians or herbalists Some were completely worthless for example Cayce once recommended breathing the fumes of apple brandy from a charred keg to cure tuberculosis

The many Cayce readings would later become commonly known practices of the New Age movement

In 1931 Edgar Cayce founded the Association for Research and Enlightenment Inc headquartered in Virginia Beach Virginia Today there are Edgar Cayce Centers in 18 other countries throughout the world

Ren Descartes was a famous French philosopher and physicist He wrote books that are very important in the fields of maths physics and especially philosophy His dualism statement combined soul mind body theories elements into one concept a dualistic theory of mind and matter

In his Discourse on Method Descartes wrote about the scientific method that deals with scientific approach thinking a method which he had invented He also wrote about shapes light and the weather He then came up with a way of describing shapes by using coordinates and also a theory of what a rainbow is Descartes physics was important for a later famous thinker Sir Isaac Newton who said about him and so did James Hook If I have seen further it is because I was standing on the shoulders of giants

In his Meditations on First Philosophy Descartes used his scientific method to look at philosophical questions He argued against skepticism 

He found that he himself must be real because he felt that he was thinking and if he was thinking then he must be real This is because if he were not real then how would he have this feeling that he was thinking He shortened this view saying in Latin Cogito ergo sum meaning I think therefore I am

He also thought he could show that God exists in the same way that he felt that he was thinking Descartes said that God was the same as infinity and that he could clearly see infinity because he could think of every larger object but no largest object Descartes said that if God exists then the world must exist as well as God was good and would not let us think the world is real if it did not 

Finally Descartes thought that because he knew he was thinking but could only know anything else about himself because he knew that God exists then he must in fact be made up of two things the mind that thinks and the body that is independent of thought process but united This is called Cartesian Dualism 

Descartes used a lot of ideas related to Plato while most people at that time used ideas related to Aristotle He is often called a rationalist because he looked inside his mind for answers to his questions Although Descartes wanted to fight skepticism his description of it in the meditations has become very famous and is often called Cartesian Skepticism after him

The Ford Model T was an American car built between 1908 and 1928 by the Ford Motor Company of Detroit Michigan It is one of the most important cars in history because it was one of the first cars to be sold for very little money making it easy for people to travel from place to place

Before the Model T most cars cost lots of money Only people with lots of money could afford them Even Fords cars before the Model T cost a lot of money A car built in 1903 called the Oldsmobile Curved Dash was very easy to buy but was a very simple and slow car that was more like a buggy than a car

The man who owned the company Henry Ford heard about meat being packed on an assembly line which moved meat from worker to worker so that the meat could be cut up No one had ever thought to use an assembly line to put cars together Ford knew that if he built his cars on an assembly line instead of one at a time like other cars he could make a car that anyone could afford and would be built like cars that cost more money He also knew that he could pay his workers lots more money 

The Ford Model T car was designed by Henry Ford Childe Harolde Wills and two Hungarian men named Jzsef Galamb and Eugene Farkas The Model T had a 177 cubic inch four cylinder engine producing 20 horsepower for a top speed of 45 miles per hour The engine had side valves and three main bearings Fuel economy was 14 to 21 miles per gallon an excellent number even today

 The beginning of the Model T 

Ford began building the Model T in his Piquette factory on October 6 1908 as a 1909 model Workers from all over the world wanted to work for Ford because of the good pay Workers could even save their money for a Model T of their own The price of the Model T dropped over the years making it even easier to buy

Work began at one end of the assembly line starting with an empty chassis From there the chassis moved slowly down the assembly line Workers on the assembly line added parts to the chassis Before long a new Model T rolled off the other end of the line Different body styles were available even a truck or Model TT At first the only color available was black Black paint of the day dried faster than other colors of paint which meant that Ford could build his cars faster and not have to wait for paint to dry As car paint got better over the years Ford began offering other colors The time it took a chassis to become a finished car was over twelve hours when the first Model Ts were built By the time the last Model T came off of the line Ford had so many auto plants it was making one car every 27 seconds

Even though the Model T sold for little money Ford used the best materials he could buy to make his car Most roads in the Model Ts day were dirt gravel or even mud That meant the Model T had to be very strong and it was The wheels and tires were very tall and skinny so that they could sink into mud roads and not get stuck It was also very simple 

Ford made the Model T easy to drive compared to todays cars since the people he sold his cars to did not know how to drive anything other than a horse It is not like driving a modern car even though there are three pedals on the floor like a modern manual transmission car A Model T has a steering wheel that works the same way as in cars of today but almost everything else is different

The first Model Ts did not even have a starter like a modern car This is the powerful electric motor in a car that turns the engine to make it run when it is turned off The engine on the Model T was started with a hand crank on the front of the car A wire loop near the radiator worked the choke on the carburetor to give the engine extra fuel to help start it when it was cold This could be dangerous if a person was not careful If the levers that controlled the engine were not set the right way especially the spark control the engine could backfire or spin the wrong way Many people got broken arms this way Doctors even had a special name for this kind of break the Ford Fracture Many Model T owners added electric starters to their cars and it was not long before Ford started doing the same A Model T is in high gear by default so if the ParkingClutch lever was not engaged the car had a tendency to run over the operator when started 

To make a modern car go or accelerate once the engine is running a person steps on a pedal on the floor to engage the transmission into low gear To make a Model T accelerate move two levers near the steering wheel The lever on the right was the throttle and the lever on the left adjusted the time that the spark plugs fired These levers needed to be set properly before the engine could be started

The three pedals on the floor of the Model T were for the brake on the right reverse in the middle to make the Model T go backwards and a pedal on the left to shift the gears from low to high speed A lever on the floor worked the brakes as well as the clutch Pulling the lever toward the driver would set the parking brake and help keep the car from moving while parked When the lever was placed in the middle the transmission would be in neutral

Once the engine is running the driver now has to make the Model T move on its own Step on the pedal all the way to the left move the throttle lever to give it the gas and gently move the floor lever forward This is low gear the powerful gear used to get the Model T moving Once its moving move the right lever up let the left pedal come all the way up and give it more gas to shift into high To make the car go faster still move the throttle lever as well as the spark advance lever Stepping on the left pedal only halfway puts the car in neutral the same as the lever This helps the Model T come to a stop without causing the engine to stop as well

The brakes on a Model T work the rear wheels by the use of brake bands inside the transmission Modern cars have brakes on all four wheels No brakes are on the front of a Model T

More than fifteen million Model T cars were built It was not until 1971 that the record was broken by the Volkswagen Today the record for the most cars built is held by the Toyota Corolla

The Model T was nicknamed the Tin Lizzie and Flivver by the people who drove it A new car took the place of the Model T in 1928 the Ford Model A

Volkswagen is a car company from Germany It was started in the 1930s at the request of the countrys leader Adolf Hitler who wanted a peoples car which is what the word volkswagen means in German Hitler asked Dr Ferdinand Porsche to design a car that almost anyone could afford Though Hitler never learned to drive he had a keen interest in cars Hitler wanted the car to have a rear mounted engine It was to be cooled by air instead of water The car needed to be able to travel at least 100 kmh or about 60 mph Also Hitler wanted the car to be able to move easily through the air He thought a car shaped like a beetle would do that The first name given to the car was KdF Wagen KdF stood for Kraft durch Freude or Strength through Joy Some were made but production ended after World War II started The factory built cars for the German military instead After the war people from the United Kingdom and the United States reopened the factory and started production again The cars especially the Volkswagen Beetle or Bug became popular and well known all over the world The Beetle later became one of the best selling cars in history It was built for many years afterward in factories in Germany Brazil and Mexico The last Volkswagen Beetle to be built was built in Mexico It was built in 2004 Volkswagen has a new car called the New Beetle It looks a bit like the old car but is larger faster and much more suited to todays modern world in terms of design

Romeo and Juliet is a play written by William Shakespeare The play was first of the two noble houses have had an argument and are enemies so all their young servants are enemies as well The young men who work for the Montagues and the Capulets get into gangs and fight each other in the street Because it is fashionable to carry a sword sometimes they get badly injured 

Verona is ruled by Prince Escalus He tells the Montagues and the Capulets that there must be no more fighting or they will have to pay but it is very hard to control the young men

Montague has only one child a teenage boy called Romeo Capulet also has only one child a beautiful 13 year old daughter called Juliet They do not know each other because Juliet never goes anywhere without her nursemaid However Romeo and Juliet meet at a party and fall in love 

Their love should heal all the problems between their families but because they are only teenagers they think they will get into trouble from their parents so they marry in secret Because of their secret marriage a series of things happen which brings about many deaths The unhappy families of Montague and Capulet are finally brought together in grief

Because this play was written in the 1500s the English language that it uses is not exactly like the English that is used today One example is that in modern English we say you for one person and also you for more than one person But in Shakespeares English he often writes thee and thou when it means just one person 

Many words are used a little bit differently to the way they are used today and other words are used that are now only used sometimes in poetry

Romeo and Juliet like many of Shakespeares plays is written is several different forms 

Some of it is prose which is like normal speaking The servants in the play usually talk in prose 

For example two Capulet servants are planning to cause trouble with two Montague servants who are walking down the street

Some of the play is written in poetry which rhymes on the ends of the lines 

For example when Friar Laurence goes out to tend his garden in the early morning he says

A lot of poetry has rhyme and rhythm But most of this play is written in a type of poetry called blank verse This means that although it does not usually rhyme it has strong rhythm The rhythm is exactly the same in most of the play and in many of Shakespeares other plays The rhythm goes 

For example Juliet who is anxious to get a message from Romeo says 

The play finishes with two lines that rhyme This is called a rhyming couplet 

The Prince says to Montague and Capulet 

Of all the scenes that have ever been written in plays one of the most famous is in Romeo and Juliet 

After Romeo and Juliet have met at a party and fallen in love Juliet goes up to bed But she cannot sleep so she stands at her window and pretends she is talking with Romeo 

Romeo climbs up onto the balcony Juliet tells Romeo that her love for him is as deep and endless as the sea They part from each other with the famous words

This romantic scene has been acted and copied many times sometimes seriously and sometimes for fun One well known scene that took its idea from this is from West Side Story a musical by Leonard Bernstein which takes place on a fire escape landing with the lovers Tony and Maria singing the lovesong Tonight

Romeo and Juliet has been performed on stage many times There have also been forty different movies

Rock and roll is a form of rock music developed in the 1950s and 1960s Rock music combines many kinds of music from the United States such as country music folk music gospel music work songs blues and jazz 

Rock and roll developed in the early 1950s from a kind of music called rhythm and blues performed by black singers and musicians At first this music was popular only with African Americans In the later 1950s and in the 1960s rock and roll became popular across the United States and in Europe

During the early 1950s the popularity of rhythm and blues music spread It became very popular among young white people They listened to this music on radio stations that broadcast across the country late at night Some teenagers began buying rhythm and blues records as a form of rebellion 

This music was very different from the music that was popular with most of their parents The music was exciting and it had a very strong rhythm and beat Some of the songs had words which suggested sexual themes In other cases the singers made sexually suggestive gestures or movements while they were singing Some adults strongly objected to rhythm and blues music They did not think young people should listen to it

Alan Freed had a radio show in Cleveland Ohio in the early 1950s He is said to be the first person to use the expression rock and roll to describe rhythm and blues music Alan Freed was one of the first to play rock and roll music on his radio show and he organized the first rock and roll concert in Cleveland in 1952

Songs by black performers like Fats Domino and Little Richard soon became popular with teenagers These singers recorded their records in the southern city of New Orleans Louisiana

Some early rock and roll music was created in the southern United States city of Memphis Tennessee In Memphis a white record producer called Sam Phillips produced records by local black musicians One day an eighteen year old truck driver came to his studio to record a song for his mother The young man was Elvis Presley Phillips produced Presleys first real record in 1954 a song called Thats All Right

Bill Haley and his Comets recorded Rock Around the Clock in 1954 It was not popular at first Then it was used in a movie about rebellious teenagers called The Blackboard Jungle The movie caused a lot of debate on the origin of rock and roll It also made the song a huge hit Rock Around the Clock became a song of teenage rebellion The song was recorded in April Elvis thats all right was recorded in July However Cecils Gants Were Gonna Rock recorded in mid 1950 is a song that many people have forgotten that was an early influence on rock n roll Its lyrics and music were like those that would be in later songs The drums and bass guitar would be similar to rock and roll songs that would be made later 

Many other rock and roll singers became popular in the 1950s They included Buddy Holly Jerry Lee Lewis Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley Each performer created his own kind of rock and roll Chuck Berrys music was a mixture of country and rhythm and blues In 1955 his song Maybellene was one of the most popular songs in the country

Before Bill Haley Hank Williams Sr recorded Move It On Over in 1947 however similar version of the song was recorded by blues artist Jim Jackson called Kansas City Blues The melody is similar to both Move It On and Rock Around Clock but latter has different tonal subtleties chords key progressions

In the 1960s black music and musicians became recognized as an important part of the music industry in America This was because a company in Detroit Michigan called Motown Records that produced some of the most popular songs in American music Berry Gordy started Motown Records He was the first person to present black music in a way that both black people and white people would like One of Motowns most successful groups was the Supremes led by Diana Ross One of their hits was Come See About Me

Thomas Alva Edison was an American inventor who invented many things Thomas Edison invented the incandescent light bulb

Edison holds the record for the most number of patents 1093

Thomas Alva Edison was born in Milan Ohio When Edison was seven years old he moved with his family to Port Huron Michigan Edison started school late because of an illness Three months later Edison was removed from school because he could not pay attention to his teacher His mother who was a teacher in Canada taught Edison at home Edisons mother helped him become motivated for learning and he was a good student to her

When Edison was twelve years old he contracted scarlet fever The effects of the fever as well as getting picked up by the ears by a train conductor caused Edison to become completely deaf in his left ear and 80 percent deaf in the other He learned Morse code of the telegraph and began a job as a brass pounder At age sixteen Edison invented his first invention which was called an automatic repeater It sent telegraph signals between unmanned stations allowing almost anyone to translate code easily and precisely at ones own speed and convenience

In 1868 Edison moved East and began to work for the Western Union Company in Boston Massachusetts as a telegraph operator He worked twelve hours a day six days a week and continued to moonlight on his own projects Within six months he had applied for and received his first patent for an electric vote recording machine It made the voting process faster

Then Edison moved to New York New York and began to work for a company fixing their machines At night he continued to work on his projects At age 29 Edison began working on the carbon transmitter which made the sound from Alexander Graham Bells new telephone invention louder In 1877 Edison invented the phonograph the first machine that could record and play sound The phonograph made him internationally famous In 1879 Edison made a light bulb that lasted longer

He invented a light bulb

He married Mary Stilwell in 1871 He had three children in that marriage Marion Estelle Edison Thomas Alva Edison Jr and William Leslie Edison Mary Stilwell died in 1884 Thomas Edison bought some land in Florida and built a house When he was thirty five Edison married Mina Miller who was 19 He had 3 children in that marriage Madeleine Edison Charles Edison and Theodore Miller Edison

Diabetes is the condition that results from lack of insulin in a persons blood or their body has a problem using the insulin it produces There are other kinds of diabetes like diabetes insipidus However when people say diabetes they usually mean diabetes mellitus People with diabetes mellitus are called diabetics

Glucose is not regular sugar that is available in stores and supermarkets Glucose is a natural carbohydrate that our bodies use as a source of energy The kind of sugar sold in supermarkets is called sucrose and is much different from glucose High concentrations of glucose can be found in soft drinks and fruits

Glucose level in the blood is controlled by several hormones Hormones are chemicals in your body that send messages from cells to other cells Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas When you eat the pancreas makes insulin to send a message to other cells in the body This insulin tells the cells to take up glucose from the blood The glucose is used by cells for energy Extra glucose that is not needed right away is stored in some cells as glycogen When you are not eating cells break down glycogen into glucose to use as energy

Type 1 diabetes mellitus happens when the part of the pancreas that makes insulin is destroyed by that persons own immune system When the pancreas does not make insulin glucose sugar in the blood cannot get into the parts of the body that need sugar to live In order to live a person with Type 1 diabetes must take insulin for the rest of their life They need to check their blood sugar level on a regular basis often many times each day Type 1 diabetes happens most of the time in younger people however it can occur in adults although this is much less common About 1 out of every 10 people with diabetes have Type 1 Diabetes

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is an illness very different from Type 1 diabetes In Type 2 diabetes the person makes insulin but either the insulin does not work in that persons body as it should or they do not make enough insulin to process the glucose When insulin does not work as it should glucose in the blood cannot get into the parts of the body that need sugar  Type 2 diabetes happens most of the time in an older person who is overweight

Gestational diabetes mellitus is like Type 2 diabetes It happens to some women when they are pregnant

Other types of diabetes include but are not limited to

Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults

Maturity onset diabetes of the young

Complications are problems that happen because of a disease In the case of diabetes there are two kinds of complications The first kind happens quickly and can be dealt with quickly This kind is called an acute complication The other kind is caused by the blood glucose being too high for many years and is called a chronic complication or long term complication

Excess blood glucose is called hyperglycemia If very high it can cause acute complications In Type 1 diabetics one of these complications is diabetic ketoacidosis which is a medical emergency and can often be detected by a fruity smell on the breath Another acute complication more common in Type 2 diabetics is non ketotic hyperosmolar coma which is also very dangerous 

Too low blood glucose is called hypoglycemia It can also cause acute complications If too low diabetics can have many symptoms such as sweating trembling anger and possibly even passing out Diabetics with hypoglycemia may be confused or even unconscious They may appear to have drank too much alcohol Severe hypoglycemia is very dangerous and can cause death The best treatment of hypoglycemia is avoiding it If it happens eating food containing glucose usually improves the condition quickly Sometimes it is treated by giving an injection of a medicine called glucagon Glucagon is a hormone made by the pancreas It has the opposite effect of insulin Administering Glucagon will cause the blood glucose level to rise by forcing stored glucose into the blood Hypoglycemia is usually caused by too much diabetic medication insufficient food too much exercise or a combination of these 

Chronic complications are mostly caused by hyperglycemia It causes damage to blood vessels and nerves Damage to blood vessels can eventually cause strokes heart attacks kidney failure blindness slow healing of skin breaks  with added possibility of infection  and even amputations from poor circulation Damage to nerves can make diabetics not feel pain This causes them to have more injuries and not realize they have hurt themselves Damage to nerves can also cause pain even when theres no real injury Its a type of phantom pain or ghost pain The pain can be so intense that strong pain medication may be required

Because of the damage caused by high blood glucose it is important to treat diabetes mellitus The goal is to maintain a normal blood glucose level The normal range for blood glucose is 80 120 mgdL or 35 7 mmoll These are different ways of saying the same thing much like yards and meters are different units of distance measurement

Diabetics should check their blood glucose often This is to make sure they do not get hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia A glucometer is a battery powered measuring device that checks the blood glucose level Diabetics often carry a glucometer with them and check their blood sugar level several times in a day They may also suffer severe constipation

Doctors may also use a blood test called a hemoglobin A1C This is sometimes written Hgb A1C or other ways theres no standard name This tells the doctor what the average blood glucose has been for about the past 90 days If the level has been too high it may indicate new medication different medication dosage or better diet may be needed

Diabetics must be monitored for signs of complications due to diabetes They should see an eye doctor regularly to be checked for damage to the blood vessels in the eyes If this is not found and treated early it can cause blindness They should have their urine or blood checked regularly for signs of kidney damage They must check their feet for cuts bruises blisters and so on at least every day And they should have their feet checked regularly for nerve damage circulation problems and infections

The most important goal in diabetes is to keep the blood glucose level as close to normal as possible Since it usually goes up after eating and down after exercise coping with it sensibly is often complex and usually takes care and thought Treatment differs between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes People with Type 1 diabetes are treated with insulin People with Type 2 usually begin with diet exercise and weight loss perhaps moving to medication

Education is important for both types of diabetes Diabetics must learn about diet They learn how to estimate and keep track of how much carbohydrate protein and fat are in different foods They plan their meals to have the right amount of carbohydrates proteins and fats Patients with Type 1 may decide how much insulin to take before a meal based on how much they will eat

Diabetics must also be careful about exercise Exercise is important to stay healthy but intense or extended periods of exercise can cause hypoglycemia As a result diabetics must plan exercise carefully

In addition to controlling blood glucose level other treatments may be needed Diabetics often have blood vessel diseases so it is important to pay attention to other diseases which may affect blood vessels In people with diabetes treating high blood pressure and high cholesterol is more important than usual Both of these diseases damage blood vessels The treatment goals can change for diabetics For instance in people without diabetes blood pressure should be 14090 or less In diabetics it should be 13080 or less

Victor Marie Hugo was a French poet playwright novelist essayist visual artist statesman human rights activist He played an important part in the Romantic movement in France 

Hugo first became famous thanks to his poetry but also his novels and his Plays Les Contemplations and La Lgende des sicles are his most famous poetry collections Hugo is sometimes thought to be the greatest French poet factdateJuly 2010 In other countries his novels Les Misrables and Notre Dame de Paris are his most famous worksfactdateJuly 2010

When he was young he was a conservative royalist As he got older he became more liberal and supported republicanism His work was about a lot of the political and social problems as well as the artistic trends of his time He is buried in the Panthon in Paris

Victor Hugo was the son of Joseph Lopold Sigisbert Hugo and Sophie Trbuchet He had two older brothers called Abel Joseph Hugo and Eugne Hugo He was born in 1802 in Besanon Hugo lived in France for most of his life During the reign of Napoleon III he went into exile In 1851 he lived in Belgium in BrusselsHe moved to Jersey in 1852 He stayed there until 1855 when he went to live in Guernsey until 1870 He lived there again in 1872 1873 From 1859 his exile was by choice 

Some great events marked Hugos early childhood A few years before his birth the Bourbon Dynasty was overthrown during the French Revolution The First Republic rose and fell and the First French Empire rose under Napolon Bonaparte Napolon became Emperor two years after Hugos birth The Bourbon Monarchy was restored When he was 17 His parents had different political and religious views These views would be the two main belligerents fighting for power in France Hugos father was an officer He ranked very high in Napoleons army He was an atheist republican and considered Napolon a hero His mother was an extreme Catholic Royalist As Hugos father was an officer they moved frequently Victor Hugo learned much from these travels He stayed in Naples and Rome for six months before going back to Paris He was only five at the time but he remembered the trip well

Sophie went to Italy with her husband who was a governor of a province near Naples They also went to Spain where Joseph governed three Spanish provinces Sophie separated temporarily from Lopold in 1803 as it was not an easy life She settled in Paris This meant she dominated Hugos education Therefore Hugos early work mainly in poetry show him praising Monarchism and Faith The 1848 Revolution made Hugo rebel against his Catholic Royalist education After that revolution he preferred Republicanism and Freethought

When he was young Victor Hugo fell in love He became secretly engaged to his childhood friend Adle Foucher against his mothers wishes

He married Adle in 1822 after his mothers death in 1821 Their first child Lopold died in infancy Hugos had 4 other children called Lopoldine Charles Franois Victor and Adle Hugo published his first novel in 1823 His second came three years later He published five more volumes of poetry between 1829 and 1840 This helped his reputation He was already considered one of the greatest elegiac and lyric poets of his time

The death of his oldest and favorite daughter Lopoldine made Hugo very sad She died at the age of 19 in 1843 This was only shortly after her marriage She drowned in the Seine at Villequier She was pulled down by her heavy skirts when a boat overturned Her husband died as he tried to save her At the time Victor Hugo was traveling with his mistress in the south of France He learned about Lopoldines death from a newspaper when he was sitting in a cafe He describes his shock and grief in his poem Villequier

 Hlas vers le pass tournant un oeil denvie Sans que rien ici bas puisse men consoler Je regarde toujours ce moment de ma vie O je lai vue ouvrir son aile et senvoler 

Je verrai cet instant jusqu ce que je meure Linstant pleurs superflus O je criai Lenfant que javais tout lheure Quoi donc je ne lai plus 

Alas turning an envious eye towards the past unconsolable by anything on earth I keep looking at that moment of my life when I saw her open her wings and fly away

I will see that instant until I die that instanttoo much for tears when I cried out The child that I had just now  what I dont have her any more 

After he wrote many poems about his daughters life and death One of his most famous poem is probably Demain ds laube In this poem he describes visiting her grave

Hugo was very influenced by Franois Ren de Chateaubriand the famous Romantic writer during the early 1800s When Hugo was young he said he would be Chateaubriand or nothing Indeed many things Chateaubriand did Hugo also did First he defended the cause of Romanticism Then he became involved in politics and supported RepublicanismFinally he was forced into exile because of his political views Hugos passion and eloquence in his early work made him successful and famous at an early age His first collection of poetry was published in 1822 At the time Hugo was only twenty years old It earned him a royal pension from Louis XVIII His poems were admired but it was his next collection four years later in 1826 which revealed Hugo to be a great poet 

Victor Hugos first mature work of fiction appeared in 1829 and reflected the acute social conscience that would infuse his later work Le Dernier jour dun condamn would have a profound influence on later writers such as Albert Camus Charles Dickens and Fyodor Dostoevsky Claude Gueux a documentary short story about a real life murderer who had been executed in France appeared in 1834 and was later considered by Hugo himself to be a precursor to his great work on social injustice Les Misrables But Hugos first full length novelCitation neededdateAugust 2009 would be the enormously successful Notre Dame de Paris which was published in 1831 and quickly translated into other languages across Europe One of the effects of the novel was to shame the City of Paris into restoring the much neglected Cathedral of Notre Dame which was attracting thousands of tourists who had read the popular novel The book also inspired a renewed appreciation for pre renaissance buildings which thereafter began to be actively preserved

Hugo began planning a major novel about social misery and injustice as early as the 1830s but it would take a full 17 years for Les Misrables to be realized and finally published in 1862 The author was acutely aware of the quality of the novel and publication of the work went to the highest bidder The Belgian publishing house Lacroix and Verboeckhoven undertook a marketing campaign unusual for the time issuing press releases about the work a full six months before the launch It also initially published only the first part of the novel which was launched simultaneously in major cities Installments of the book sold out within hours and had enormous impact on French society The critical establishment was generally hostile to the novel Taine found it insincere Barbey dAurevilly complained of its vulgarity Flaubert found within it neither truth nor greatness the Goncourts lambasted its artificiality and Baudelaire  despite giving favorable reviews in newspapers  castigated it in private as tasteless and inept Les Misrables proved popular enough with the masses that the issues it highlighted were soon on the agenda of the French National Assembly Today the novel remains his most enduringly popular work It is popular worldwide has been adapted for cinema television and stage shows

The shortest correspondence in history is between Hugo and his publisher Hurst Blackett in 1862 It is said Hugo was on vacation when Les Misrables was published He telegraphed the single character message to his publisher who replied with a single Citation neededdateMay 2009

Hugo turned away from socialpolitical issues in his next novel Les Travailleurs de la Mer published in 1866 Nonetheless the book was well received perhaps due to the previous success of Les Misrables Dedicated to the channel island of Guernsey where he spent 15 years of exile Hugos depiction of Mans battle with the sea and the horrible creatures lurking beneath its depths spawned an unusual fad in Paris Squids From squid dishes and exhibitions to squid hats and parties Parisians became fascinated by these unusual sea creatures which at the time were still considered by many to be mythical Citation neededdateJuly 2007 The word used in Guernsey to refer to squid was to enter the French language as a result of its use in the book Hugo returned to political and social issues in his next novel LHomme Qui Rit which was published in 1869 and painted a critical picture of the aristocracy However the novel was not as successful as his previous efforts and Hugo himself began to comment on the growing distance between himself and literary contemporaries such as Flaubert and mile Zola whose realist and naturalist novels were now exceeding the popularity of his own work His last novel Quatre vingt treize published in 1874 dealt with a subject that Hugo had previously avoided the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution Though Hugos popularity was on the decline at the time of its publication many now consider Ninety Three to be a work on par with Hugos better known novelsWeasel inlinedateMay 2009

After three unsuccessful attempts Hugo was finally elected to the Acadmie franaise in 1841 solidifying his position in the world of French arts and letters A group of French academiciens particularly Etienne de Jouy were fighting against the romantic evolution and had managed to delay Victor Hugos election Thereafter he became increasingly involved in French politics He was elevated to the peerage by King Louis Philippe in 1841 and entered the Higher Chamber as a pair de France where he spoke against the death penalty and social injustice and in favour of freedom of the press and self government for Poland However he was also becoming more supportive of the Republican form of government and following the 1848 Revolution and the formation of the Second Republic was elected to the Constitutional Assembly and the Legislative Assembly

When Louis Napoleon seized complete power in 1851 establishing an anti parliamentary constitution Hugo openly declared him a traitor to France He relocated to Brussels then Jersey and finally settled with his family on the channel island of Guernsey at Hauteville House where he would live in exile until 1870

While in exile Hugo published his famous political pamphlets against Napoleon III Napolon le Petit and Histoire dun crime The pamphlets were banned in France but nonetheless had a strong impact there He also composed or published some of his best work during his period in Guernsey including Les Misrables and three widely praised collections of poetry

He convinced the government of Queen Victoria to spare the lives of six Irish people convicted of terrorist activities and his influence was credited in the removal of the death penalty from the constitutions of Geneva Portugal and Colombia He had also pleaded for Benito Juarez to spare the recently captured emperor Maximilian I of Mexico but to no avail 

Although Napoleon III granted an amnesty to all political exiles in 1859 Hugo declined as it meant he would have to curtail his criticisms of the government It was only after Napoleon III fell from power and the Third Republic was proclaimed that Hugo finally returned to his homeland in 1870 where he was promptly elected to the National Assembly and the Senate

He was in Paris during the siege by the Prussian army in 1870 famously eating animals given to him by the Paris zoo As the siege continued and food became ever more scarce he wrote in his diary that he was reduced to eating the unknown

Because of his concern for the rights of artists and copyright he was a founding member of the Association Littraire et Artistique Internationale which led to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works

Hugos religious views changed radically over the course of his life In his youth he identified himself as a Catholic and professed respect for Church hierarchy and authority From there he became a non practicing Catholic and increasingly expressed anti catholic and anti clerical views He dabbled in Spiritualism during his exile and in later years settled into a Rationalist Deism similar to that espoused by Voltaire A census taker asked Hugo in 1872 if he was a Catholic and he replied No A Freethinker

Hugo never lost his antipathy towards the Roman Catholic Church due largely to what he saw as the Churchs indifference to the plight of the working class under the oppression of the monarchy and perhaps also due to the frequency with which Hugos work appeared on the Popes list of proscribed books On the deaths of his sons Charles and Franois Victor he insisted that they be buried without crucifix or priest and in his will made the same stipulation about his own death and funeral However although Hugo believed Catholic dogma to be outdated and dying he never directly attacked the institution itself 

Hugos Rationalism can be found in poems such as Torquemada The Pope Religions and Religion and published posthumously The End of Satan and God Religions pass away but God remains Hugo declared Christianity would eventually disappear he predicted but people would still believe in God Soul and the Power Citation neededdateFebruary 2010

Although Hugos many talents did not include exceptional musical ability he nevertheless had a great impact on the music world through the endless inspiration that his works provided for composers of the 19th and 20th century Hugo himself particularly enjoyed the music of Gluck and Weber and greatly admired Beethoven and rather unusually for his time he also appreciated works by composers from earlier centuries such as Palestrina and Monteverdi Two famous musicians of the 19th century were friends of Hugo Berlioz and Liszt The latter played Beethoven in Hugos home and Hugo joked in a letter to a friend that thanks to Liszts piano lessons he learned how to play a favourite song on the piano even though only with one finger Hugo also worked with composer Louise Bertin writing the libretto for her 1836 opera La Esmeralda which was based on the character in The Hunchback of Notre Dame Although for various reasons the opera closed soon after its fifth performance and is little known today it has been recently enjoying a revival both in a pianosong concert version by Liszt at the Festival international Victor Hugo et gaux 2007 and in a full orchestral version to be presented in July 2008 at Le Festival de Radio France et Montpellier Languedoc Roussillon

Well over one thousand musical compositions have been inspired by Hugos works from the 1800s until the present day In particular Hugos plays in which he rejected the rules of classical theatre in favour of romantic drama attracted the interest of many composers who adapted them into operas More than one hundred operas are based on Hugos works and among them are Donizettis Lucrezia Borgia Verdis Rigoletto and Ernani and Ponchiellis La Gioconda Hugos novels as well as his plays have been a great source of inspiration for musicians stirring them to create not only opera and ballet but musical theatre such as Notre Dame de Paris and the ever popular Les Misrables London West Ends longest running musical Additionally Hugos beautiful poems have attracted an exceptional amount of interest from musicians and numerous melodies have been based on his poetry by composers such as Berlioz Bizet Faur Franck Lalo Liszt Massenet Saint Sans Rachmaninov and Wagner

Today Hugos work continues to stimulate musicians to create new compositions For example Hugos novel against capital punishment The Last Day of a Condemned Man has recently been adapted into an opera by David Alagna Their brother tenor Roberto Alagna performed in the operas premiere in Paris in the summer of 2007 and again in February 2008 in Valencia with Erwin Schrott as part of the Festival international Victor Hugo et gaux 2008 In Guernsey every two years the Victor Hugo International Music Festival attracts a wide range of musicians and the premiere of songs specially commissioned from Guillaume Connesson and based on Hugos poetry

When Hugo returned to Paris in 1870 the country hailed him as a national hero Despite his popularity Hugo lost his bid for reelection to the National Assembly in 1872 Within a brief period he suffered a mild stroke his daughter Adles internment in an insane asylum and the death of his two sons His wife Adle had died in 1868 His faithful mistress Juliette Drouet died in 1883 only two years before his own death Despite his personal loss Hugo remained committed to the cause of political change On 30 January 1876 Hugo was elected to the newly created Senate The last phase of his political career is considered a failure Hugo took on the role of a maverick and got little done in the Senate

In February 1881 Hugo celebrated his 79th birthday To honor the fact that he was entering his eightieth year one of the greatest tributes to a living writer was held The celebrations began on the 25th when Hugo was presented with a Svres vase the traditional gift for sovereigns On the 27th one of the largest parades in French history was held Marchers stretched from Avenue dEylau down the Champs lyses and all the way to the center of Paris The paraders marched for six hours to pass Hugo as he sat in the window at his house Every inch and detail of the event was for Hugo the official guides even wore cornflowers as an allusion to Cosettes song in Les Misrables

Victor Hugos death on 22 May 1885 at the age of 83 generated intense national mourning He was not only revered as a towering figure in literature he was a statesman who shaped the Third Republic and democracy in France More than two million people joined his funeral procession in Paris from the Arc de Triomphe to the Panthon where he was buried He shares a crypt within the Panthon with Alexandre Dumas and mile Zola Most large French towns and cities have a street named for him The avenue where he died in Paris now bears his name

Many are not aware that Hugo was almost as prolific in the visual arts as he was in literature producing more than 4000 drawings in his lifetime Originally pursued as a casual hobby drawing became more important to Hugo shortly before his exile when he made the decision to stop writing in order to devote himself to politics Drawing became his exclusive creative outlet during the period 1848 1851

Hugo worked only on paper and on a small scale usually in dark brown or black pen and ink wash sometimes with touches of white and rarely with color The surviving drawings are surprisingly accomplished and modern in their style and execution foreshadowing the experimental techniques of Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism

He would not hesitate to use his childrens stencils ink blots puddles and stains lace impressions pliage or folding grattage or rubbing often using the charcoal from match sticks or his fingers instead of pen or brush Sometimes he would even toss in coffee or soot to get the effects he wanted It is reported that Hugo often drew with his left hand or without looking at the page or during Spiritualist sances in order to access his unconscious mind a concept only later popularized by Sigmund Freud

Hugo kept his artwork out of the public eye fearing it would overshadow his literary work However he enjoyed sharing his drawings with his family and friends often in the form of ornately handmade calling cards many of which were given as gifts to visitors when he was in political exile Some of his work was shown to and appreciated by contemporary artists such as Van Gogh and Delacroix the latter expressed the opinion that if Hugo had decided to become a painter instead of a writer he would have outshone the artists of their century

Radio control is a way of making models of cars boats helicopters and airplanes move on their own like real ones

Invisible electrical signals called radio waves come out of a part called a transmitter The transmitter is a box with the models controls on it When a control is moved the radio signal changes The part on the model that takes the changing signals and helps turn them into movement is called the receiver The receiver then tells a special kind of motor called a servo to move part of the model On a car or boat a servo is usually used for steering Model sailboats use a servo to adjust the sail as well as the rudder or steering device On airplanes and helicopters servos are used not only for steering but for up and down pitch If the model uses an engine to make it run a servo is used to control the speed of the engine A model which operates with an electric motor usually has something called an electronic speed control or ESC to control its speed 

Radio control was once used by the military to control large weapons

The samurai also named bushi were the members of the military class of Japan In other words they were Japanese warriors The word samurai comes from the Japanese verb saburai which means to serve Samurai lived during the Edo period

The samurais importance and influence grew during the shinot Period Towards the end of the Edo Period two military clans the Minamoto and Taira had grown so powerful that they took control over the country and fought wars against each other as each one tried to be more powerful In 1185 the Minamoto Yoritomo started a new government in Kamakura in 1192 As shogun the highest military officer he became the ruler of Japan

During the chaotic Era of Warring States Japan consisted of dozens of independent states which were constantly fighting each other This is why the country needed lots of samurai Between the wars many samurai were working on farms Many of the famous samurai movies by Akira Kurosawa take place during this era

When Toyotomi Hideyoshi reunited Japan he started a very strict social caste system which was later completed by Tokugawa Ieyasu and his successors Hideyoshi forced all samurai to decide between a life on the farm and a warrior life in castle towns Furthermore he made it a law that the samurai were the only people who were allowed to arm themselves with a sword

According to the Edo Periods official hierarchy of social castes the samurai were the most important followed by the farmers artisans and merchants Each caste was then divided into different groups according to importance All samurai were forced to live in castle towns and received income from their lords in form of rice Samurai without masters were called ronin and caused minor troubles during the early Edo Period

With the fall of Osaka Castle in 1615 the Tokugawa had lost his last possible rival and it was much more peaceful in Japan for about 250 years As a result martial skills became less important and most samurai became bureaucrats teachers or artists

In 1868 Japans feudal era came to an end and the samurai class was abolished

Samurai were able to use many weapons However their most famous weapon a long sword called a Katana was their symbol when the hold the weapons they always had in there right hand A samurai carried two swords In peace time he carried a Katana and a short sword Wakizashi In war time he carried a long sword Tachi and a short sword Tant He wore less armor than knights from Europe

A samurai believed that his swords hold his soul so they became the most important thing he had

Samurai were allowed to fight anyone who did not show them proper respect Every sword had to be tested to do this the owner of the sword could execute a criminal This allowed the warrior to test his swords sharpness Samurai led their lives according to the ethic code of bushido which translates as the way of the warrior This signifies loyalty to ones master self discipline and respectful ethical behaviour from visitors to enemies on the battlefield When a samurai lost his master also called Daimyo he became a Ronin 

After a defeat or the samurai dishonored himself by not following the code of bushido the samurai must commit ritual suicide which is called Seppuku To a samurai death was better than having no honour In Seppuku samurai cut their stomach before the enemy could capture them in the case of a war In Europe this ritual is often mistaken for hara kiri Hara kiri means to cut the stomach In other words hara kiri refers only to the action done by Seppuku and not the whole ritual Seppuku was thought to be a more honourable death for a samurai than being captured by the enemy Another reason to commit Seppuku was the death of the Daimyo With this ritual a samurai was able to show how loyal he was to his dead master There were periods when Seppuku was forbidden but there were still samurai who committed it

The bushis training methods like meditation judo and kendo are still followed today Although there is no longer a samurai class in modern Japan the successors of these families are well respected

It has to be noted that the term Samurai is a gender specific term referring to males specifically An academic article on this can be found here

Japanese women had a very clear role in Japanese society Most of them took care of house and crops and raising children There were a few women who were samurai One of the most famous Japanese samurai women was Itagaki She lived during the end of the Heian period and owned her own army of about 3000 warriors In 1199 Itagaki fought against 10000 Heike soldiers She was very good at handling the naginata sword which made her very famous 

Samurai women were also trained to defend themselves and their children They usually did this while their warrior husbands were busy in battles The samurai wife was called okusan This is why samurai women were trained to handle polearms and short daggers During the Edo period Japanese women were trained to handle naginata by the age of 18 The short kaiken knife was used by young women to defend their virtue or if they lost it to take their own life

The Japanese women especially the samurai wives were very respected They had qualities that made them an important part of Japanese society They were obedient self controlled loyal responsible etc Wives of rich samurai were very well dressed and enjoyed a good position in society They did not do any physical work However no women were allowed to be involve in politics or warfare 

Of course there were women who were powerful For example in Muromachi period the wife of Ashikaga Yoshimasa Hino Tomiko ruled in his place The Toyotomi Hideyoshis mistress became the real master of Osaka castle after his death Yamauchi Kazutoyos wife Chiyo was one of the most loyal wives known in Japanese history Her power was of another kind she supported her husband during hard times saving to buy a horse for him Yamauchi Kazutoyo never took a mistress though it was a known tradition for samurai and he never left Chiyo although she was only able to have one child 

During Tokugawa Era womens education became very important Girls were taught to write read dance etc beginning at a young age While the main criteria for marriage changed among the most important were physical attractiveness and education Special books were written for women They mainly taught how to take care of house and children But by the end of the Tokugawa period women attended philosophical and literary classes

The Republic is a book by Plato it was finished in 390 BC It asks the question why should people do good things and also the question are people rewarded for doing bad things Plato said that people should not do bad things because people who do bad things end up unhappy However people who do good things end up happy

He also said that if people who do bad things get power in a society then that society will become an unhappy one Plato believed that philosophers are best able to do good things and so they should be given power in a society He thought that non philosophers should allow themselves to be ruled by philosophers and that if they do this then they will be happy However in order not to be tempted to do bad things the philosophers who have power must not be able to own things or feel love

Plato also talked about many other things while discussing these questions including metaphysics psychology religion and most branches of philosophy He introduced the philosophy called Platonism

Plato thought that people and societies are very much alike

Plato thought that people are made of three things

He said that a good person will listen to all these things but will let the mind control the other two

Somebody who does not listen to all three parts or who does not let the mind control the other two will be unhappy They might go mad because they do not let the mind control them Or they might do things that they later regret They will also be disliked by other people and will suffer because of that He said that they will be like a country in anarchy

Plato also thought society should be made up of three things

He said that society needs all three things but that only the philosophers will be good people The others will be dominated by their souls or bodies not their minds The soldiers will not even listen to their minds and the workers will not listen to their minds or their souls This is why the philosophers should rule and the other types of people should be soldiers and workers

Aesthetics is a branch of philosophy It is the study of art and beauty Together with ethics it is part of axiology which is the philosophy of what people like

Aesthetic philosophers ask what people like to look at hear feel smell or taste and why they like these things Aesthetic philosophers also ask if art has any value For example they may ask if some art that nobody likes and that nobody wants is art at all or if it is something else

Plato Aristotle and Immanuel Kant are some important philosophers of aesthetics

One theory in aesthetics is called subjectivism Subjectivism says that each person has their own sense of beauty So the only way of judging somethings beauty is if people say it is beautiful A common way of describing this is Beauty in the eye of the beholder Subjectivism also says for the same reason that something is art simply because someone says it is art This is backed up by the experience that even though people feel they find something beautiful they may not be able to explain why it

Many objectivist theories of beauty have been offered going from very ancient ideas Plato and Aristotle which still have great appeal in their own way to neuroscience research into the brains response to images and other sense information At the moment even though we do not know what people are thinking brain scan technology can identify when people are responding pleasurably to images providing some clue as to how certain images affect some people

The name diesel is given to an engine invented by a German named Rudolf Diesel in the late 19th century

Most engines need a system called an ignition system one that uses an electric spark in order to burn the mix of fuel and air and make power Other types of ignition systems used compressed air from an outside source such as an air compressor A diesel does not It burns a diesel fuel similar to heating oil through very high compression or pressing together of the mix A tiny bit of fuel is injected or forced into the engines cylinders at just the right moment Since gases heat when they are pressed together the compression of the air and fuel mix cause the mix to explode within the cylinder  

Diesel engines make very good use of the fuel they burn They also make lots of torque or twisting power An engine with a lot of torque will be able to spin its shaft even if it is very hard to do This makes a diesel engine a good choice in heavy equipment like trucks trains and construction machines The very big trucks on the road have diesels in them So do trains unless they are steam powered Sometimes even the torque of a diesel engine is not enough to run such big machines To boost power large diesels often have a device called a turbocharger attached A turbocharger is a type of turbine something used to move a lot of air very quickly Jet engines also contain a turbine In the diesel pressure from the exhaust spins the turbocharger at very high speed Fresh air is then forced back into the engine Since any engine is a sort of air pump the more air you can put through it the more power it makes That is where the turbocharger helps A diesel engine fitted with a turbocharger is called a turbodiesel The whistling sound sometimes heard near one of these engines is caused by the turbocharger or turbo for short 

A diesel engine can also be made to run on vegetable oil made from old cooking oil This type of fuel is called biodiesel Running a diesel engine on biodiesel fuel makes the exhaust smell like food

Running a diesel engine on vegetable oil is not a new idea The engine that Rudolf Diesel used to demonstrate his new idea ran on peanut oil

The guitar is a string instrument which is played by plucking the strings The main parts of a guitar are the body the fretboard the headstock and the strings Guitars are usually made from wood or plastic Their strings are made of steel or nylon 

The guitar strings are plucked with the fingers and fingernails of the right hand or a small pick made of thin plastic This type of pick is called a plectrum or guitar pick The left hand holds the neck of the guitar while the fingers pluck the strings Different finger positions on the fretboard make different notes

Guitar like plucked string instruments have been used for many years In many countries and at many different time periods guitars and other plucked string instruments have been very popular because they are light to carry from place to place they are easier to learn to play than many other instruments Guitars are used for many types of music from Classical to Rock Most pieces of popular music that have been written since the 1950s are written with guitars

There are many different types of guitars classified on how they are made and the type of music they are used for All traditional types of guitar have a body which is hollow This makes the sound of the strings louder and gives the guitar its quality This type of guitar is called acoustic

From the 1930s people started making and playing guitars that used electricity and amplifiers to control the loudness These guitars which are often used in popular music are called electric guitars They do not need to have a hollow body This is because they do not use acoustics to amplify the sound 

Most guitars have six strings but there are also guitars with four seven eight ten or twelve strings More strings make the instrument sound fuller The neck of a guitar has bars or marks called frets Frets help a guitarist know where to put his or her fingers to get the right pitch when playing

The word guitar was adopted into English from Spanish word guitarra in the 1600s In the Middle ages the word gitter or gittern was used in England Both guitarra and gitter came from the Latin word cithara The word cithara came from the earlier Greek word kithara Kithara could have come from the Persian word sehtrfactdateJuly 2010 seh meaning three and tr meaning string There is also a similar but two stringed Persian instrument named dotr do means two in Persian The Indian sitar instrument was named after the Persian sehtr The sihtar itself is related to the Indian instrument the sitar

A person who plays a guitar is called a guitarist A person who makes or fixes guitars is a luthier which comes from the word lute The word lute comes from the Arabic Al Uud a stringed instrument from the Middle East The guitar appears to be derived from earlier instruments known in ancient central Asia as the Sitara Instruments very similar to the guitar appear in ancient carvings and statues recovered from the old Iranian capitol of Susa The modern word guitar was adopted into English from the Spanish word guitarra which came from the older Greek word kithara Possible sources for various names of musical instruments that guitar could be derived from appear to be a combination of two Indo European rootsfactdateJuly 2010 guit similar to Sanskrit sangeet meaning music and tar a widely found root meaning cord or string The word guitar is a word that the Iberian Arabic language took from the Persian language The word qitara is an Arabic name for various members of the lute family that preceded the Western guitar The word guitarra was introduced into Spanish when such instruments were brought into Iberia by the Moors after the 10th century

There have been instruments like the guitar for at least 5000 years The guitar may have come from older instruments known as the sitara from ancient India and central Asia The oldest known picture of a guitar like instrument is a 3300 year old stone carving of a Hittite bard The oldest guitar like instrument that is still complete is the Warwick Gittern in the British Museum It belonged to Elizabeth I of England and probably to her father Henry VIII before it was given to her It is about 500 years old

The design of the modern guitar began with the Roman cithara The cithara was brought by the Romans to Hispania around 40 AD In the 8th century the Moors brought the four stringed oud into Spain The introduction to the oud caused changes to the design of the cithara AD In other parts of Europe the six string Scandinavian lut became popular wherever the Vikings had been By 1200 AD there were two types of the four string guitar the guitarra morisca from Spain which had a rounded back wide fingerboard and several soundholes and the guitarra latina which was more like the modern guitar with one sound hole and a narrower neck

The Spanish vihuela of the 16th century was another instrument similar to the guitar It had lute style tuning and a body that was like a guitar The vihuela was only popular for a short amount of time It is not known whether it was simply a design that combined features of the oud and lute or a transition from the Renaissance instrument to the modern guitar

The Vinaccia family from Naples Italy were famous mandolin makers It is thought that they also made the oldest six string guitar that still exists There is a guitar built that was signed and dated 1779 on the label by Gaetano Vinaccia Although there are many fakes that have dates on them from that time this guitar is believed by experts to be genuine

Modern guitars come in four main types The classical guitar is used for classical music The term acoustic guitar is generally used for a guitar used for popular music even though a classical guitar is also an acoustic instrument There are many other different types of acoustic guitars from different parts of the world

A electric guitar can be flat hollow or semi hollow and produces sound through its pickups which are wire wound magnets that are screwed onto the guitar Some guitars combine the hollow acoustic body with amplified sound Bass guitars are designed to make a low bass rhythm

A special electric folding travel guitar called the Foldaxe was invented for Chet Atkins by inventor and guitarist Roger Field featuring a built in way to keep the string tension and tuning the same even when folded and ready to play when unfolded Atkins demonstrated his several times on US television and also on The Today Show with Les Paul who was with him as a guest

Gayes first became successful when he co wrote the Marvelettes top twenty hit Beechwood 4 5789 In 1962 he released his own song called Stubborn Kind of Fellow It was partly about his own life and got into the top fifty of the pop chart and number eight on the RB side His first top 40 single Hitch Hike and his first top ten hit Pride Joy made him a teen idol These early singles and those on his second release That Stubborn Kind of Fellow featured Martha and the Vandellas in the backGaye had more successful songs like early success continued with Can I Get a Witness Baby Dont You Do It You Are a Wonderful One and Try It Baby In late 1964 Gaye recorded How Sweet It Is which peaked at the top ten of the American pop charts and became one of his first hits abroad reaching the top fifty in the United Kingdom Gaye also worked with his friend singer Smokey Robinson to write number one singles Ill Be Doggone and Aint That Peculiar

After his early success which Marvin had struggles with Motown began to widen his role as a ladies man having him record duet albums with Mary Wells Kim Weston and Diana Ross His first album with Wells Together became Marvins first charted album and yielded two popular hits while his single with Weston the Sylvia Moy penned It Takes Two hit the top twenty on both sides of the Atlantic But it would be his collaboration with Philadelphia RB singer Tammi Terrell that landed him his biggest known success in his duet work Building on songs written by Ashford Simpson the team of Marvin and Tammi scored a multitude of hits including their original version of Aint No Mountain High Enough Your Precious Love Aint Nothing Like the Real Thing and Youre All I Need to Get By Their success would be short lived following Tammis collapse during a show at Virginia in October of 1967 Having complained of headaches Tammi was rushed to the hospital that night and was diagnosed with a brain tumor Terrell braved it out but by the release of their third and last album together Easy was losing her fight with the tumor Tammi died in March of 1970 at the age of 24 from complications of her brain cancer Marvin was said to be so devastated by Tammis death that he said he felt a piece of him died with her and reports state at her funeral Marvin talked to her remains as if she was gonna respond Promising not to tour again and not to record another duet album after that Marvin went into a self imposed seclusion that ended briefly In 1973 Marvin would work on his final duet album with Diana Ross Their recording was hampered by arguments between them as Marvin refused to stop smoking marijuana in the studio as Diana was then pregnant The resulting album Diana and Marvin became a top twenty US success and reached the top ten in the UK

In 1968 Marvin returned to the top of the charts as a solo act with the Norman Whitfield penned I Heard It Through the Grapevine The song originally recorded in 1967 was initially blocked from release since Berry Gordy disapproved of the song Instead one of its cover versions by Gladys Knight the Pips was released and it ended up reaching number two Whitfield was determined to get Gordy to release Marvins and in October 1968 Motown finally issued Grapevine as a single where it eventually reached number one in December of that year it also reached number one in the UK and became the biggest selling single in Motown history during the sixties During this period Marvin used his Grapevine success to produce a collection of singles for his background group the Originals Those songs Baby Im for Real and The Bells became top 40 recordings After two more top ten hits that followed Marvin began working on a more personal production Inspired by Tammi Terrells death his brother Frankies Vietnam stories footage of the Vietnam War and race riots in the US Marvins success with his first productions and a rough draft of a song composed by Four Tops member Obie Benson Marvin recorded an introspective single titled Whats Going On Like Grapevine Motown refused to release it due to it being uncommercial and risky since Gordy could not find a song to match anything with and also because Gordy was against anyone in his company to talk openly about serious issues In spite of releases by the Temptations the Supremes and Edwin Starr which opened about inner city struggle illegitimate pregnancy and wars respectively Motown was afraid the song would ruin Marvins squeaky clean teen pop image Marvin confident in his own abilities stood his ground and in January of 1971 the song was released quickly becoming a hit single reaching number two on the Billboard pop chart and number one on the Cashbox pop chart also hitting number one on the Billboard RB chart A follow up album of the same name was quickly released that May and with accompanying top ten singles Mercy Mercy Me and Inner City Blues songs that also talked about social issues including environmentalism the album sold over a million copies and permanently made Marvin one of the first independent artists on the label Inspired by Marvins success Stevie Wonder refused to renew his contract with Motown in May of 1971 after releasing the non Motown approved Where Im Coming From an album that also dealt with social issues In 1972 Motown signed Marvin to a 1 million contract making him at the time the highest paid black recording artist in music history Marvin celebrated the contract by releasing the pro political single Youre the Man which attacked the Nixon administration Moving from Detroit to Los Angeles that year he recorded the soundtrack to the movie Trouble Man The soundtrack and its title track became top twenty and top ten hits on the charts respectively In 1973 Marvin dramatically changed direction from social topics to sexual politics with the release of Lets Get It On The song became Marvins second number one Billboard hit and was the biggest selling RB single of that year Its subsequent album became another critical milestone as Whats Going On had been and with his new look as a wool hat wearing studded jean outfit bearded messiah Marvin had become an icon of early seventies soul music

In 1974 Marvin returned officially to touring after a four year sabbatical following the death of Tammi Terrell and began to suffer from the effects of a long developing cocaine addiction which started in the late sixties Marvin went a year without producing a record though through yet another new Motown contract he built a recording studio in the middle of Sunset Boulevard In 1976 Marvin released the erotic I Want You album an album that had been delayed by his first wife Anna Gordys divorce case against him The divorce was finalized after Marvin agreed to remit a portion of his royalties from his next album to Ms Gordy The result was the controversial Here My Dear project which came out in early 1979 after two years of holding the project from release Marvin recorded a disco hit in 1977 titled Got to Give It Up The song hit number one marking his third pop hit to reach the spot and his twelfth on the RB side It would end up being his last major hit with the Motown label Following the release of Here My Dear the album tanked and Marvin already run dry by dwindling finances numerous lawsuits a troubling marriage to a second wife and an even more troubling cocaine addiction eventually left his wife three children and the US settling first in Hawaii and then settling in London in 1980 after a European promoter advised him to tour Europe Recording most of his final Motown release In Our Lifetime in London the album was rush released by Motown in early 1981 much to Marvins chagrin he complained that the label had edited certain songs including one that seemed unfinished and had taken off a question mark that he put at the end of the title to ask a question about life Marvin stated he would no longer record for Motown and was granted his wish when CBS Records brought him out of his contract in April of 1982

Masturbation is the act of a person touching their own genitals It is not always done to the point of orgasm Masturbating can be done alone or with a partner either by watching each other or by helping each other This is called mutual masturbation Machines and sex toys are made to make masturbation more pleasurable or easier but it is often done with a hand There are no known health risks of masturbation Studies have shown that a vast majority of people masturbate on a regular basis although the rate of masturbation varies greatly from one or two times per month to once or more daily

The main female sex organ is the clitoris Therefore female masturbation almost always involves stimulating the clitoris either by hand or with a vibrator Many women also enjoy the feeling of fingers or a sex toy in the vagina however this is a secondary sensation that is not necessary for orgasm and that rarely results in orgasm on its own Some women find stimulation of the front vaginal wall or G spot particularly pleasurable The anus is rich in nerve endings and is also sometimes stimulated during masturbation as are the nipples

Masturbation is usually continued until orgasm Some women may have problems reaching an orgasm especially when they are young and have little experience masturbating When this happens more practice and a reliable vibrator with strong vibration can help a great deal

Some women experience multiple orgasms  several orgasms in a row without loss of arousal It should be noted however that women who are not capable of multiple orgasms report as much orgasmic satisfaction as women who are multi orgasmic

Masturbation for males is the act of stimulating the penis manually to provide self pleasure For older teens and adults masturbation usually ends in what is called an ejaculation This ejaculation is usually accompanied by a powerful pleasurable feeling called an orgasm Most boys start masturbating between the age of 12 and 15 There are many ways in which a male can choose to masturbate The most common of these techniques  is the fist Fisting is very easy to do You simply wrap your hand around the shaft of your penis and move your hand up and down

Usually the man will hold the penis in his hand and move the hand up and down Sometimes a lubricant is used to create a softer sensation As the sensation increases in intensity the rate of hand movement generally quickens until orgasm occurs Orgasm is a very pleasurable feeling which results in semen being ejaculated from the penis Men may also rub and touch other sensitive areas of the body such as the scrotum the nipples and the anus The anus is rich in nerve endings and is sometimes stimulated during masturbation

People may not masturbate on any given day Some people masturbate every day sometimes even multiple times a day How often someone masturbates or the frequency of masturbation depends on many things One of the things that the frequency of masturbation depends on are hormones Sexual arousal depends on hormones Other things that the frequency of masturbation depend on are sexual habits Sexual habits are sexual activities that people do because they are used to doing them Other people of the same age or standing  called peers  can also influence this frequency General health is another of the many factors The general attitude towards masturbation is formed by culture Medical causes have also been associated with masturbation

Forty eight female college students were asked to complete a sexual attitudes questionnaire in which a frequency of masturbation scale was embedded Twenty four of the women then individually viewed an explicit modeling film involving female masturbation One month later all subjects again completed the same questionnaire Subjects in the experimental group also completed a questionnaire evaluating aspects of the film Results indicated that the experimental group reported a significant increase in the average monthly frequency of masturbation as compared to the control group This same group however reported that the film had no effect on sexual attitudes or behavior

A 2004 survey by Toronto magazine NOW was answered by an unspecified number of thousands The results show that an overwhelming majority of the males 81 began masturbating between the ages of 10 and 15 Among females the same figure was a more modest majority of 55 It is not uncommon however to begin much earlier and this is more frequent among females 18 had begun by the time they turned 10 and 6 already by the time they turned 6 Being the main outlet of child sexuality masturbation has been observed in very young children In the book Human Sexuality Diversity in Contemporary America by Strong Devault and Sayad the authors point out A baby boy may laugh in his crib while playing with his erect penis Baby girls sometimes move their bodies rhythmically almost violently appearing to experience orgasm 

According to a Canadian survey of Now magazine readers the frequency of masturbation declines after the age of 17 However most males masturbate daily or even more frequently well into their 20s and sometimes far beyond This decline is more drastic among females and more gradual among males While females aged 1317 masturbated almost once a day on average adult women only masturbated 89 times a month compared to the 1822 among men It is also apparent that masturbation frequency declines with age Adolescent youths report being able to masturbate to ejaculation six or more times per day though some men in older middle age report being hard pressed to ejaculate even once per day The survey does not give a full demographic breakdown of respondents however and the sexual history of respondents to this poll who are readers of an urban Toronto lifestyle magazine may not extend to the general population

It appears that females are less likely to masturbate while in a heterosexual relationship than men Both sexes occasionally engage in this activity however even when in sexually active relationships Popular belief asserts that individuals of either sex who are not in sexually active relationships tend to masturbate more frequently than those who are however much of the time this is not true as masturbation alone or with a partner is often a feature of a relationship Contrary to conventional wisdom several studies actually reveal a positive correlation between the frequency of masturbation and the frequency of intercourse as well as the number multiple sex partners One study reported a significantly higher rate of masturbation in gay men and women who were in a relationship

Among some cultures such as the Hopi in Arizona the Wogeno in Oceania and the Dahomeans and Namu of Africa masturbation is encouraged including regular masturbation between males In certain Melanesian communities this is expected between older and younger boys One interesting twist is the Sambia tribe of New Guinea This tribe has rituals and rites of passage surrounding manhood which involve frequent ejaculation through fellatio Semen is valued and masturbation is seen as a waste of semen and is therefore frowned upon even though frequent ejaculation is encouraged The capacity and need to ejaculate is nurtured for years from an early age through fellatio so that it can be consumed rather than wasted Semen is ingested for strength and is considered in the same line as mothers milkfact

Other cultures have rites of passage into manhood that culminate in the first ejaculation of a male usually by the hands of a tribal elder In some tribes such as the Agta Philippines stimulation of the genitals is encouraged from an early age Upon puberty the young male is then paired off with a wise elder or witch doctor who uses masturbation to build his ability to ejaculate in preparation for a ceremony The ceremony culminates in a public ejaculation before a celebration The ejaculate is saved in a wad of animal skin and worn later to help conceive children In this and other tribes the measure of manhood is actually associated more with the amount of ejaculate and his need than penis size Frequent ejaculation through masturbation from an early age fosters frequent ejaculation well into adulthood

Masturbation is becoming accepted as a healthy practice and safe method for sharing pleasure without the strings It is socially accepted and even celebrated in certain circles Group masturbation events can be found online in just about any state Masturbation marathons are yearly events and are occurring across the globe from the US to the UK These events provide a supportive environment where masturbation can be performed openly among young and old without embarrassment Participants talk openly with onlookers while masturbating to share techniques and describe their pleasure

In the context of evolution masturbation serves a well defined purpose It can increase fertility during sexual intercourse It does this by using sexual functions In females it can regulate the conditions in the vagina cervix and the uterus This can either increase or decrease the chance of conception Whether the chance is increased or decreased depends on the timing of the masturbation This timing is a subconscious decision If she has intercourse with more than one male it favors the chances of one or the other males sperm reaching her egg

Female masturbation can also protect against cervical infections It does this by increasing the acidity of the cervical mucus and by moving debris out of the cervix

The function of masturbation in males is to flush out old sperm with low motility from the males genital tract The next ejaculate contains more fresh sperm which has higher chances of achieving conception during intercourse If more than one male is having intercourse with a female the sperm with the highest motility will compete more effectively

The physical benefits of masturbation and having an orgasm or ejaculating creates heightened arousal while epinephrine courses through your body producing the flushed face shallow breath and post climactic euphoria 

It is held in many mental health circles that masturbation can relieve depression stress and lead to a higher sense of self worth Masturbation can also be particularly useful in relationships where one partner wants more sex than the other in which case masturbation provides a balancing effect and thus a more harmonious relationship 

Mutual masturbation the act by which two or more partners stimulate themselves in the presence of each other allows a couple to reveal the map to their pleasure centers Witnessing a partner masturbate is a educational activity to find out the method a partner pleases them selfs allowing each partner to learn exactly how the other enjoys being touched 

In 2003 an Australian research team led by Graham Giles of The Cancer Council Australia concluded that frequent masturbation by males appears to help prevent the development of prostate cancer The study also indicated that this would be more helpful than ejaculation through sexual intercourse because intercourse can transmit diseases that may increase the risk of cancer instead Also frequent strong ejaculations are more easily attained over time with the aid of masturbation

A study published in 1997 found an inverse association between death from coronary heart disease and frequency of orgasm even given the risk that myocardial ischaemia and myocardial infarction can be triggered by sexual activity Excerpt The association between frequency or orgasm and all cause mortality was also examined using the midpoint of each response category recoded as number of orgasms per year The age adjusted odds ratio for an increase of 100 orgasms per year was 064 That is a difference between any two subjects appeared when one subject ejaculated at around two or more times per week than the other Assuming a broad range average of between 3 5 ejaculations per week for a healthy males this would mean 5 to 7 ejaculations per week This is consistent with a 2003 Australia article on the benefits against prostate cancer Some people actually use masturbation as part of their cardiovascular workout and for stress relief 

Masturbation is also seen as a sexual technique that protects individuals from the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases Support for such a view and for making it part of the American sex education curriculum led to the dismissal of US Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders during the Clinton administration A 2011 study from the Indiana University supports the assertion After taking age and partner status into account the study showed that sexually active boys who masturbated regularly were eight times more likely to have used a condom during their last intercourse than other boys This positive outcome has been observed in other studies and has been the basis of public health policy in Great Britain promoting masturbation

Many people see masturbation as an effective natural cure for insomnia Sexual climax from masturbation or otherwise leaves one in a relaxed and contented state This is frequently followed closely by drowsiness and sleep  particularly when one masturbates in bedFactdateMay 2007

Some people actually consider masturbation as a cardiovascular workout And while doctors have no proof of this actually being true those suffering from cardiovascular disorders should resume physical activity gradually and with the frequency and rigor which their physical status will allow Some doctors will advise those recovering from heart attacks to abstain from sexual activity until one is able to climb two flights of stairs without experiencing shortness of breath or chest pain FactdateFebruary 2007 This limitation can serve as encouragement to follow through with physical therapy sessions to help improve endurance

Masturbation makes most people feel good and can sometimes replace sexual intercourse when one cannot find a partner It can also prepare one for sexual intercourse

A small study has shown that a test group which only had intercourse experienced as a whole lower blood pressure in stressful situations than those who had intercourse but also had masturbated for one or more days

Objects inserted into the vagina or anus should be clean and should not be able to scratch or break Care should be taken not to fully insert anything into the anus any object used should have a flared or flanged base otherwise getting it out may need medical help Modern dildos and anal plugs are designed with this feature

Masturbation involving both a man and a woman can result in pregnancy only if semen contacts the vulva Masturbation with a partner can also theoretically result in transmission of sexually transmitted diseases by contact with bodily fluids

A man whose penis has suffered a blunt trauma or injury during intercourse may rarely sustain a penile fracture or suffer from Peyronies disease Phimosis is a contracted foreskin may cause trouble by hurting when an attempt is made to pull the foreskin back In these cases any energetic manipulation of the penis can be problematic

Lawrence I Sank observed that masturbating prone could be responsible for sexual problems in some men including anorgasmia and erectile dysfunction as observed in four men he examined He coined the term traumatic masturbatory syndrome to describe this theory As of 2007 no follow up research has been conducted and the idea is not familiar or widely held within the medical community Some sources however give credence to the idea One sex therapist condemned masturbation by rubbing against a pillow or mattress and Lipsith et al suggest that masturbation could play a part in male psychogenic sexual dysfunction citing Sank as their authority MPSD is a difficulty in reaching orgasm during intercourse and developing a dependence on masturbation

Masturbating frequently presents no physical mental or emotional risk in itself but masturbation can be used to relieve boredom or stress In either case as with any nervous habit it is more helpful to consider the causes of the boredom or of the stress rather than try to repress the behavior itself in this case masturbation

There is some discussion between professionals and other interested parties as to the existence or validity of sexual addictions Nevertheless there are lists of warning signs such as when sexual activity affects a persons ability to function in everyday life or is placing them at risk for example of pursuing illegal or destructive activities Very frequent and compulsive masturbation may be seen as a sign of sexual addiction

Animation is a way of making a movie from many still images The images are put together one after another and then played at a fast speed to give the illusion of movement Most animations are played at a speed of twenty four to sixty images every second Each image becomes one frame of the movie 

A person who makes animations is called an animator 

There are three ways to animate

Because it is expensive to make most animation comes from professional companies However independent animators have existed since the 1950s in America with many of those people entering the professional industry In Europe the independent movement has existed since the 1910s with animators like pre revolutionary Russias Ladislas Starevich and Germanys Lotte Reiniger

On the internet many people use a computer program called Flash to create animations Flash uses a combination of drawing and computer graphics to make animations Many animations on the internet are made in Flash Most animators on the internet do not work for professional companies

On television limited animation is used a lot It is used by popular companies such as UPA and Hanna Barbera Productions Simple limited movement makes the images easier to draw which lowers the cost of making animations and makes the production of animation faster

Confucius was an important Chinese educator and philosopher His original name was Kong Qiu or Zhong Ni As a child he was eager to learn about everything and was very interested in rituals Once he grew up he worked as a state official who handled farms and cattle Then he became a teacher

Confucius lived in a time when many states were fighting wars in China This period was called the Spring and Autumn period of the Zhou Dynasty Confucius did not like this and wanted to bring order back to society

Like Socrates Confucius sometimes did not answer philosophical questions himself Instead he wanted people to think hard about problems and to learn from others especially from history Confucius also thought that people should get power because they were good and skilled and not just because they came from powerful families

Confucius wanted people to think about other people more than about money or what they owned However he also felt that there should be strong rules in society and that people needed to obey them Confucius thought that there were five relationships people could have and that they all had their own rules Two persons could be

These were traditional relationships called the five prototypes Confucius said that in all these relationships both people must obey rules For example a subject must obey a prince but also a prince must listen to a subject and must rule him well and fairly

Confucius said that people should only do things to other people if they would be okay with other people doing those things to themselves This is sometimes called the Golden Rule and was also taught by Jesus Christ

His students wrote down small stories about him and things that he said These were put together to make a book called The Analects

Consciousness means being awake alert and responsive with the environment The definition of consciousness may differ in psychology neuroscience philosophy and other related sciences

Consciousness is a spectrum There are several states between a fully conscious state and a fully unconscious state In medicine the degree of loss of consciousness is measured by using Glasgow Coma Scale a score between 3 and 15 is given to each person at any time to show how conscious he or she is Higher scores show more conscious states

The opposite of consciousness is subconsciousnessunconsciousness This means people do things that are instinctive and do not think about them like breathing and making ones heart beat

An architect is a person who designs buildings and prepares plans to give to a builder What he or she designs is called architecture Architects make drawings with pens pencils and computers and this is also called drafting Sometimes they first make small toy sized buildings called models to show what the building will look like when it is done Some of these models survive for hundreds of years eg at St Pauls Cathedral London 

Architects decide the size and shape of a building and what it will be made from They are the key designers of any and all buildings Architects need to be good at math and drawing and must have imagination They must go to university and study for a long time There are special tests that must be taken before becoming an architect For example the tests make sure that architects know how to make the buildings structure safe so that it will not collapse They should also know how to make a building attractive so that people will enjoy using it To be an architect you must go to college or a university for 5 years

Although there has been architecture for thousands of years there have not always been architects The great European cathedrals built in the Middle Ages were designed by a Master Builder who scratched his designs on flat beds of plaster Paper did not exist in Europe at this time and vellum or parchment were very expensive and could not be made in large sizes Some cathedrals took hundreds of years to build so the Master Builder would die or retire and be replaced and often plans changed Some cathedrals were never finished like Notre Dame in Paris or La Sagrada Familia in Barcelona

An architect has a very important job because his or her work will be seen and used by many people probably for a very long time If the design materials and construction are good the building should last for hundreds or even thousands of years This is rarely the case Usually building cost is what limits the life of a building but fire war need or fashion can also affect things As towns and cities grow it often becomes necessary to make roads wider or perhaps to build a new train station Architects are employed again and so the city changes Even very important buildings may get knocked down to make way for change

La Jolla is a town inside the city of San Diego in the state of California in the United States It is pronounced La Hoya and the name comes from Spanish

An arch is an opening in a building that is curved on top The curved part can be round like part of a circle or pointed like two parts of circles next to each other Arches are often used where buildings are made of lots of small stones or bricks The stone at the very top of the arch called the keystone keeps the rest of the arch stones from falling down Arches can go over doorways and windows

The vagina is a part of the female human body Menstrual fluid leaves the body through the vagina During birth the vagina opens to let the baby through from the uterus for independent life The vagina is reddish pink in color though colors may vary

It is on the lower centre of the vulva It is the tube leading from the uterus to the outside of the body The opening is found between the legs inside the labium behind the opening to the urethra a tube leading to the bladder and in front of the anus the opening to the rectum

The vagina is an elastic muscular tube starting from the cervix and ending at the vulva It is about 6 to 75 cm wide and 9 cm long During sexual intercourse and childbirth the vagina gets wider and bigger

The vagina has to be lubricated to stay clean and allow sexual intercourse and childbirth It is lubricated by the Bartholins glands This mucus also allows sperm easier access to fertilize an ovum

The vagina releases blood and tissue during menstruation Tampons can be used to absorb some of the blood

During sexual intercourse the mans penis is placed in the womans vagina The vagina is warm and grips the penis which feels really good for both partners The man can have an orgasm after repeated thrusts During his orgasm he ejaculates semen from his penis into the vagina The semen contains sperm which can then travel from the vagina into the uterus to fertilize an egg and make a woman pregnant The vagina has lots of nerves so when a woman is aroused she has a pleasurable sensation which can cause her to have an orgasm too though this is not required for sexual reproduction Touching or rubbing the clitoris or G spot can help lead her to an orgasm

During arousal the vagina gets up to 85 cm wider but can get bigger with more stimulation

The G spot is found near the entrance of the vagina The G spot if stimulated leads to a strong orgasm or female ejaculation Some researchers deny the existence of the G spot

During birth the vagina acts as a path for the baby to pass through The vagina is very elastic and stretches to many times its normal diameter during birth

Sperm needs to be deposited at the top of the vagina near the cervix or ring of muscle at the entry to the uterus and fertilize the ovum if pregnancy is to occur

In a normal childbirth babies come out through the vagina

The breast is an organ on the lower chest region of humans and other primates Humans have two breasts Both boys and girls have breasts at birth but during puberty the breasts on women become larger and visible The breasts have mammary glands that produce milk Breastfeeding is letting an infant drink breast milk

Men also have breasts They are built the same way as those of women but are much smaller and underdeveloped Men cannot use their breast for breastfeeding Their breasts will usually not produce milk but might become larger and produce milk during some diseases or with some hormonal medical treatments

Girls develop breasts during puberty due to sex hormones mainly estrogen

The appearance and size of the breasts of a woman may vary due to genetic factors and the amount of fatty and connective tissue Hormones also play a role

Estrogen promotes the growth of mammary glands and ducts while progesterone induces milk producing cells to develop Prolactin and oxytocin stimulate milk production Oxytocin also causes milk to be spurted from a lactating breast

The two breasts usually are not equal in size one may be larger than the other but this is common

During menopause as levels of estrogen decrease tissue in the breasts reduce as well and the breasts may start sagging A study showed that breastfeeding does not cause sagging Factors that do influence sagging are the size of the breast number of pregnancies body mass index smoking and age

The center of the breast is the nipple The areola is a circular area around the nipple The breast contains mammary glands Ducts carry the milk produced by these glands to the nipples After a woman has a baby her breasts undergo lactation the production of natural milk

Feeding babies milk is called breastfeeding or nursing

The breasts of a woman also play a role in human sexual behaviour They are one of the most visible or obvious female secondary sex characteristics They play an important role in sexual attraction of partners They can also give pleasure to the individual When sexually stimulated the size of the breasts increases venous patterns across the breasts become more visible and nipples grow harder During sexual intercourse it is common practice to press or massage breasts with hands Breasts are sensitive to touch as they have many nerve endings Oral stimulation of nipples and breasts is also common Some women can achieve breast orgasms In the ancient Indian work the Kama Sutra marking breasts with nails and biting with teeth are explained as erotic

The thumb is one of the five fingers on the human hand Thumbs are different from the other four fingers because they are in a different direction have only 2 bones and are shorter Thumbs allow us to pick things up This is called having opposable thumbs Thumbs have an artery in them Arteries have a pulse This is why we should not take other peoples pulses with our thumbs

Pregnancy is when a female mammal has an unborn baby inside her A human pregnancy is usually nine months long Pregnancy usually starts when a woman has sexual intercourse with a man Her ovum and his sperm come together and form a zygote inside her The zygote grows into an embryo which grows into a fetus When the fetus is ready it is born 

Pregnancy is divided into three parts called trimesters Each trimester is about three months long During the first trimester the woman often feels sick in her stomach and has to urinate often During the second trimester the womans body starts to look pregnant and her belly starts to stick out During the third trimester her belly sticks out even more and the woman becomes even heavier Many other things happen to the woman during pregnancy At the end of a full pregnancy the woman goes into labour and her body lets the baby come out When this happens it is called delivering a baby or giving birth Labour can hurt a lot for the woman 

Sometimes during pregnancy there are problems A miscarriage is when the fetus comes out of the woman too early and the pregnancy ends suddenly There are also certain sicknesses caused by pregnancy Sometimes women die from giving birth although in developed countries this is much less common than it used to be

A pregnancy can also stop without the baby being born This is called abortion Abortion can happen spontaneously because there is a problem with the baby or the mother Doctors can also do things that will cause an abortion to happen Such an abortion is called induced abortion Different countries have laws about induced abortions Some countries allow it and others do not In some countries it is allowed but only for certain circumstances People also have different opinions about abortion Often these are influenced by religious beliefs 

There are certain diseases which make pregnancies very dangerous for the mother Mothers with certain diseases will need to have an abortion to protect their life 

A forest is an area of land with many trees Many animals need forests to live and survive Forests are very important and grow all over the world Many forests are being cut down for houses to be built because of overpopulationThis cutting down of forests is called deforestation and it is causing damage to the natural habitat of animals Even roads have been built for the peoples to pass though the forest to reach their destination People have gotten rid of forest to build towns cities farms factories and other things that we will use

Forests usually have an average temperatures of 4 C to 10 C and low temperatures of 10 C to 6 C but they can also have very high temperatures of 20 C to 27 C Forests are also rich in rain so lots of water related animals live in the pools on the ground in forest woods in the forest is used for making furniturestoyspencils etc Sometimes we use the forest as a shelter

The three major forest biomes are coniferous forests deciduous forests and tropical rain forests

Coniferous forests stretch across Canada Alaska Northern Asia and Northern Europe They are composed of trees called conifers or evergreens The weather during the winter is cold but the snow in coniferous forests melts completely in the spring turning some parts of the forest into swamps There are only eight types of trees in the coniferous forests including balsams firs and black spruce There are not many different types of trees in coniferous forests because of the cold weather and the poor soil Fallen branches needles and dead animals do not decay as fast as in warmer regions This is why the soil in coniferous forests is not very fertile Also only those trees that have adapted to cold weather and poor soil have been able to survive These trees have flexible branches that support heavy snowfalls Less water evaporates from their leaves because of the shape of their needles

Many coniferous trees shade large parts of the soil below them which keeps many plants from growing on the forest ground Some animals that live in the coniferous forests are pine martens deer bears caribou moose lynxes beavers and birds such as graw owls crossbill birds and warbles

Deciduous forests grow in North America Europe and Asia They have a moderate climate during the spring summer fall and winter with rainfall of at least 500mm a year Summers are warm and winters are cold but not as cold as the northern coniferous forests In the winter snow covers the ground and all the deciduous trees and plants lose their leaves The decaying leaves help make the soil rich in nutrients Many insects spiders snails and worms make their homes in this rich soil Wild flowers and ferns grow almost everywhere in the spring New leaves capture the energy of the sun and sprout before the tall trees to grow too thick to let the sun reach them hi During the winter birds migrate snakes and frogs hibernate and raccoons spend the coldest months sleeping in their dens Raccoons will only come out of their dens when the weather is warm

Some of the other animals also hibernate or simply slow down their metabolism and eat food they stored during the summer and fall months The trees in the winter are brave but with the coming of spring leaves sprout birds return animals are born and all the forest animals get busy with their lives Animals that we may see in this biome are bears white tail deer raccoons otters beavers fox frogs squirrels snakes salamanders eagles and birds such as woodpeckers robins and blue jays

Tropical Rainforests grow in South America Central Africa Southern Asia Hawaii and a small part of Australia Tropical rain forests are aptly named as it rains here almost everyday The only season in a tropical rain forest is summer so plants grow for all 12 months of the year Trees are tall and thick in the rain forest and they grow so close together that they seem to form a big umbrella of greenery called a canopy This blocks out most of the sunlight The air is muggy as it filters through the dense canopy cover of the trees The light that filters through this tree cover is dim and green Only along river banks and in places that have been cleared does enough sunlight allow plants to grow on the forest ground

Millions of species of plants and animals live in the worlds tropical forests Life in the rain forest exists at different levels or layers in the trees Ech of these layers have a special name such as emergent canopy understory and forest floor

A barber is someone who cuts hair and shaves beards Usually it is men who go to a barber Women usually go to hairdressers instead Barbers sometimes have a pole outside which is red and white in most countries Barbering is a most ancient and honorable profession with a very interesting history Barbering is the practice of cutting or trimming hair and includes shaving or trimming facial hair Besides cutting hair barbers also shampoo and style hair mostly for male clients Other duties include scalp treatment skin care and fitting or grooming hairpieces In some states barbers color highlight or bleach hair 

The main job of a barber is to cut a clients hair The goal is to improve the appearance of the hair and to adapt styles to the customers wishes Barbers also shape and trim beards and mustaches Instruments such as scissors and combs must be kept sterile and in good condition and the barber is also responsible for keeping the shop clean by sweeping up hair Owners of barbershops also order supplies pay bills and may hire and supervise staff Good interpersonal skills and a positive attitude are important qualities to have when working as a barber Examples of famous barbers are Alex Kelly and Cameron Kelly formally known as the Kelly Cutters Many barbers use these men as examples and aim to also deliver a very high quality service 

With experience barbers can manage a salon or barber shop or eventually open their own shop Advancement is also possible in teaching barbering Some states combine barbering and cosmetology licenses into one Some states allow transferring a barbering license from another state without additional formal training but not all states allow this

A carpenter is a person who works with wood They can make cabinets build houses or do other things with wood

Carpenters usually make very good foremen on larger jobs as they deal with so much of the project from ground up Carpenters are always adding to their tools and always learning how to use the new tools materials and ways of working with wood

Many carpenters will choose to focus their skills in one of two broad ranging categories Rough carpenters will focus on building things that need to be simple and structural These things include framing for houses or crates for shipping Finish carpenters will focus on things that are detailed and artistic This can include things like furniture builders and toy makers

The man who made Pinocchio was a carpenter

An electrician is a person who fixes the wires and switches in a building so that lights and outlets work the right way

A roof is the top part of the building It keeps out rain and snow and protects people from the sun Some roofs are sloped or pitched so the rain and snow fall off easily Some roofs are flat but even flat roofs have a little bit of pitch so the water can flow away towards a drain 

Gable hip gambrel and mansard roofs are types of pitched roofs Those roofs are usually covered in shingles but some are covered in metal broken wikt linkslateslate or cement It can be dangerous to walk on a pitched roof Some pitched roofs have parts that stick out for windows These are called dormers The edges of pitched roofs are called eaves Often there are gutters and leaders at the eaves which take away water from the roof

Flat roofs are usually covered in rubber or types of plastic You can walk on a flat roof At the edge of a flat roof there is sometimes a broken wikt linkparapetparapet which prevents people from falling off the roof

A brick is a man made building material used to make walls and make places to walk

Bricks are made of clay Bricks are either formed into molds or cut with wires and then baked in an oven The color of a brick depends on the color of the clay from which it was made

Masons build brick walls They join bricks together using mortar

Bricks can be assembled into many different patterns The most common pattern is called running bond A row of bricks is called a course A wall that is just one brick thick has one wythe

Bricks used outdoors on the ground are called pavers

The oldest shaped bricks found date back to 7500 BC They have been found in ayn a place located in the upper Tigris area in south east Anatolia close to Diyarbakir Newer bricks dated between 7000 and 6395 BC come from Jericho and Catal Hyk The invention of the fired brick is believed to have arisen in about the third millennium BC in the Middle East Fired bricks were much more resistant to cold and moist weather conditions Fired bricks enabled the construction of permanent buildings in regions where the harsher climate precluded the use of mud bricks

San Diego is the second largest city in the US state of California It is at the southwest corner of California as well as the southwest corner of the continental United States It mostly has nice weather all year There are many military bases in and near San Diego The San Diego Zoo is very famous

San Diego is located on the border between the United States and Mexico The city of Tijuana is just across the border in Mexico

They are home to the San Diego Chargers football team and the San Diego Padres baseball team

San Diego is a very popular urban landscape in modern cinema The film Anchorman starring comedian Will Ferrell joked that it was A fact the greatest city in the world Though scholars have maintained that the translation was lost sometime before the Germans discovered the city in 1904

The Old World oriole or just Oriole is a bird in the family Oriolidae They make up the genus Oriolus Old World orioles are found areas of Africa Asia and Europe They are most often found in tropical areas but one species lives in cooler areas The Golden Oriole is the only species of Old World oriole which is not a tropical bird

Orioles have bright colored feathers

Orioles are not related to the New World oriole New World orioles are members of the family Icteridae and are native to the Americas 

This is a list of kinds of orioles in the English and Latin languages

Feathers are the things which cover birds Feathers help keep birds warm Feathers also protect them from injury In most kinds of birds feathers help them to fly

The feathers which cover the outside of a bird are called vaned feathers A vaned feather has a stiff center with soft barbs on the side which seem like hairs The center is called a quill This type of feather is called pennaceous

Young birds have small feathers called down which keep them warm but can not be used for flying Down is very soft Adult birds have down but also have vaned feathers on top of the down Down is also used in blankets Down feathers are just one example of plumaceous feathers Another example is the feathers on flightless birds such as the ostrich

Birds lose their feathers at certain times This is called moulting By moulting a bird can replace old feathers with new ones Many birds moult once every year

Feathers give birds color Color is used to identify kinds of birds It is also used by male birds to attract female birds Colour can vary from bird to bird making it easier to tell which species it is

People use feathers for many purposes In the past quills were commonly used as pens and colorful feathers were worn on hats Many pillows cushions mattresses coats and quilts are stuffed with down Feathers are also used by people of many tribes for decoration

It once owned the Disney Store shopping chain until 2004 Jim Hensons Muppets have taken its place since then

Hypercholesterolemia means that the cholesterol level is too high in the blood

Cholesterol is a molecule in cells It is a type of lipid which is a fat or fat like molecule Cholesterol is a special type of lipid that is called a steroid Steroids are lipids that have a special chemical structure This structure is made of four rings of carbon atoms

Other steroids include hormone steroids like cortisol estrogen and testosterone In fact all steroid hormones are made from changing the basic chemical structure of cholesterol When scientists talk about making one molecule from changing simpler ones they sometimes call it synthesis

Cholesterol is usually in the walls of cells It is only in animals Plants do not synthesize cholesterol So the cholesterol in the food people eat can only come from eating food from animals But even vegans who eat only plant foods can have cholesterol This is because most of the cholesterol that is in our bodies is synthesized by our bodies

Cholesterol does many important jobs in a cell Cholesterols main function is as a structural component of cell membranes It is also the starting material for bile acids that are made by the liver and used to digest fats and for steroid hormones However it is best known for something bad that it does High levels of cholesterol can lead to atherosclerosis This is an inflammatory disease of artery walls in which white blood cells invade the vessel wall and become engorged with cholesterol and other lipids These areas can slowly close off a blood vessel or can suddenly rupture and trigger formation of a blood clot

Not all cholesterol is bad There are different kinds of cholesterol in the blood Doctors often measure these different types to see if someone has hypercholesterolemia

HDL an acronym for high density lipoprotein is sometimes called good cholesterol because people with high levels of HDL cholesterol have less atherosclerosis

LDL is sometimes called bad cholesterol because people with high levels of LDL cholesterol have more atherosclerosis

High blood levels of VLDL also causes more atherosclerosis However measuring its level in blood is more expensive So the blood level of triglycerides is used instead High triglycerides are found in people with high VLDL

When atherosclerosis gets bad enough it can cause blockage of blood flow in arteries This can hurt whatever the artery brings blood to The organ or tissue that the blocked artery brought blood to can even die If the organ or tissue dies doctors call this an infarction If it is hurt from low blood flow but not enough to die it is called ischemia 

If the artery brought blood to the heart people can have angina or a heart attack A heart attack is also called a myocardial infarction Myocardial means relating to the heart muscle Infarction means death of a tissue or organ So a myocardial infarction or heart attack is when blood flow to part of the heart stops Then that part of the heart dies Angina is when the blood flow is low but not totally blocked 

If the blocked artery brought blood to the brain people can have a stroke If the blocked artery is to the kidneys it can cause kidney failure If the blocked artery is to an arm or leg they may also die If this happens the arm or leg may need to be amputated if the blood vessel cannot be fixed by doctors

The best way to treat it is to not get it Some people develop atherosclerosis faster than others Some develop it very slowly Many things make those differences between people Some are things people can change Some are not 

However once someone gets hypercholesterolemia which means high blood cholesterol doctors treat them The first way to treat hypercholesterolemia is to exercise quit smoking and eat better foods If these work and the cholesterol blood levels become normal no more treatment is needed If these do not work sometimes medicines are also needed But even if medicine is used it is still important to stop smoking eat better and exercise

Once someone gets atherosclerosis from hypercholesterolemia a better diet exercise and quitting smoking may not be enough If people already have atherosclerosis that causes problems like heart attack or strokes medicine is almost always needed

People with atherosclerosis must also be watched by doctors to make sure they do not get ischemia or infarction Since they are more likely to get a myocardial infarction or stroke they must watch for signs of these Sometimes if a doctor thinks a person has atherosclerosis she may do tests to find atherosclerosis before it causes symptoms of ischemia or infarction But if people get symptoms of these problems it is important to see a doctor immediately

For all of these types of ischemia or infarction doctors can try to reopen the blocked artery This may be done my surgery or sometimes with very strong medicines to make the blood less able to make clots If this is not done fast enough the tissue or organ with ischemia may be too badly hurt to save

The most common type of medicine to treat hypercholesterolemia are statin drugs They are called statins because their names all end in statin They are also called HMG CoA Reductase Inhibitors This is because they work by inhibiting the enzyme HMG CoA Reductase Inhibiting an enzyme means to make it work less well

The HMG CoA Reductase enzyme causes the body to make more cholesterol If it is inhibited the body makes less cholesterol So statin drugs lower the amount of LDL cholesterol in the blood which stops atherosclerosis from getting worse Statin drugs can even help make atherosclerosis better However statins are not as good at increasing the HDL cholesterol Low HDL is hard to treat with medicines but goes up with more exercise

There are two big problems with taking statins Liver problems and Rhabdomyolysis

Rhabdomyolysis means a disease where muscle cells are damaged and die Statins can cause damage to muscle cells This can cause weakness and muscle pain The worse problem though is that when muscle cells die they release cell proteins into the blood The kidney removes the muscle protein from the blood If the kidney takes up too much protein it can be hurt If it is bad enough it can cause kidney failure So if people take statins and get muscle pain or weakness stop the medicine and see a doctor

Statins can also cause liver problems They can cause mild irritation of the liver They can rarely cause very bad liver damage Because of this when someone starts taking a statin doctors check liver blood tests after six weeks Doctors also warn patients to watch for the signs of liver damage pain in the right side of the abdomen nausea vomiting and jaundice

However both of these problems are rare In someone with hypercholesterolemia the benefit from statins is more than the risk This means that someone is more likely to prevent problems than cause problems by taking them There are many big scientific studies of this problem that show the same thing if people have hypercholesterolemia and take statins they are more likely to live longer and be healthier

There are other kinds of medicines to treat hypercholesterolemia But statins are the most effective treatment

Fibrates are medicines that lower cholesterol levels They may also help people with Type II Diabetes This is a good effect because diabetes and hypercholesterolemia cause some of the same problems If both diabetes and hypercholesterolemia happen in the same person the problems from these diseases can be much worse Fibrates can have rhabdomyolysis like the statins and also can cause upset stomach Use of fibrates and statins at the same time makes rhabdomyolysis happen much more often

Niacin is a vitamin that lowers cholesterol levels It is also called Vitamin B3 or nicotinic acid Severe niacin deficiency in the diet can cause a disease called Pellagra This is rare in the developed world today However less bad deficiency of niacin can cause high blood pressure weight gain and hypercholesterolemia So sometimes Niacin is used to treat hypercholesterolemia Niacin is one of the medicines that may make HDL cholesterol go up The biggest problem with taking enough Niacin to help cholesterol is that it causes severe flushing This side effect is so bad sometimes people stop taking the medicine

Bile Acid Resins are medicines that make people not absorb as much bile when they digest food This causes them to take up less cholesterol also which lowers blood levels of cholesterol

Cholesterol is a molecule that is found in cells It is a type of lipid which is a fat or fat like molecule Cholesterol is a soft waxy substance Cholesterol is a special type of lipid that is called a steroid Steroids are lipids that have a special chemical structure This structure is made of four rings of carbon atoms Cholesterol is found especially in animal fats

Other steroids include hormone steroids like cortisol estrogen and testosterone In fact all steroid hormones are made from changing the basic chemical structure of cholesterol When scientists talk about making one molecule from changing simpler ones they sometimes call it synthesis

Hypercholesterolemia means that cholesterol level is too high in the blood Cholesterol levels that are high are possible precursors to heart disease Cholesterol levels should be checked as early as age 10

Iowa is a state in the Midwestern United States Its name comes from the Ioway people one of the Native American tribes that lived in Iowa Iowa was a part of New France but was sold to the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase Its settlers were mostly farmers Iowa is part of the Corn Belt and is often known as the Food Capital of the World However Iowas landscape culture and economy are diverse with the economy changing in the second half of the 20th Century to include many kinds of business

Iowa has more than 3 million people as of2010altas of the 2010 census Its capital and largest city is Des Moines Iowa became a state in 1846 It was the 29th state to join the United States

The eastern border of the state is marked by the Mississippi River which runs between Iowa and Illinois The western border is marked by the Missouri and Big Sioux rivers The northern border is a line 43 degrees 30 minutes north latitude The southern border follows the northern border of Missouri Iowa and Missouri disagreed about the location of the Iowa Missouri border This argument was ended by the Supreme Court of the United States in the 1896 case State of Missouri v State of Iowa after a standoff called the Honey War The border follows the Des Moines River for the far eastern part of the state and is at close to 40 degrees 35 minutes north for the rest of the state

In sociology gender identity describes the gender that a person sees themselves as It can also be used to refer to the gender that other people treat the individual as based on what they know from gender role indications like clothing and hairstyle

People who feel like they do not fit normal gender roles are called transgender Some transgender people people feel like they were born with a physical gender that does not match who they feel they are They are called transsexual Some transsexual people change their body to make it more like their gender identity These people may have surgery or take medicines to change their body

Gender presentation or gender role means how a person dresses looks and acts Someone who wears mens clothes has a job that men usually have and acts in a masculine way has a male gender presentation This is different from gender identity because people can choose to act one way even if that is not how they feel inside

Sometimes people just call this presentation

These can be confusing because most people have a sex gender presentation and gender identity that are the same When we talk about male we usually think this means all three things We also usually assume that this means he likes women In most people they are all the same either male or female But in transgender people they can be different

A good way to look at it is this

Sex is whether a person is biologically male or female

Gender or Gender Identity is how a person feels inside

Gender Presentation or Gender Role is how a person dresses acts and behaves

Sexual Orientation is about the gender which a person finds attractive

It is possible to have every different combination of sex gender identity gender presentation and sexual orientation Here are some of those possible combinations

A person may be biologically female but have a male gender identity Many people like this may dress and act like men and take jobs that are usually done by men This person may call himself transgender If he has surgery or takes testosterone he may call himself transsexual He may not use any of these terms but may simply call himself a man If he loves men he may call himself a gay man If he likes women he may call himself a straight man

A man might like to dress up in womens clothes This is often done as a performance on a stage This man may have a male gender identity and a male sex He may also have a male gender role most of the time but when he does drag he may have a female gender role

A lesbian woman is biologically female Most lesbian women have a female gender identity Some lesbian women may have some male gender roles She may dress in masculine clothes cut her hair short and work in a job that men usually have This is sometimes called being a butch or butch lesbian 

Some people may have a gender identity that is different from their sex However if they live in a place where transgender people are not accepted they may hide this They may also hide it because they are afraid their family will not accept them So a transgender woman like this might have a female gender identity but have a male sex and a male gender presentation She might want to have a female gender presentation but does not because of fear

When a persons gender identity and body do not match they may go to see a doctor The doctor may help them change their body if that is what they want Doctors may diagnose this person with Gender identity disorder Principle 18 of the Yogyakarta Principles a document about international law on human rights insists that any classifications to the contrary a persons gender identity is not in and of itself medical condition 

This is a very controversial subject This means that people disagree about it Some transgender or transsexual people do not think they have an illness or disease They may feel like this because disease and illness can make it seem like something is wrong with a person They see being transgender or transsexual as a trait or characteristic like being left handed

However some transgender people may not mind the words illness or disease This is especially important for transgender people who get medical treatments Some national health insurances pay for transsexual treatments But if these were not seen as an illness they might not pay

Americas Army is a multiplayer first person shooter computer game series It can be played using Windows Macintosh or Linux It is the official game of the United States Army The first version was free It came out on July 4 2002 It has been updated many times since then The second important release was Americas Army Special Forces in November 2003 Americas Army was made by the MOVES Institute at the Naval Postgraduate School It is based on the Unreal engine 

Americas Army is a tactical shooter It is also called a serious games According to the games website Americas Army provides civilians with an inside perspective and a virtual role in todays premier land force the US Army The game is designed for verisimilitude and to provide an accurate portrayal of Soldier experiences across a number of occupations In the game players will explore progressive individual and collective training events within the game Once they successfully completed these events they will advance to multiplayer operations in small units 

On February 20 2005 there were 46 million registered players and 27 million of them had finished basic training Also there were more than 15000 servers being used and 13 million rounds being played each day The game has been changed a lot This keeps people interested in the game It can be found as a free download on the Internet or on a CD ROM at recruiting centers around the United States

In 1999 Lieutenant Colonel E Casey Wardynski a professor at the US Military Academy at West Point decided to tell the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Military Manpower about his idea for an online computer game His basic idea eventually became Americas Army In the same year less people were joining the army Congress decided to use aggressive innovative experiments including Americas Army to get more people to join the Army

The first release was July 4 2002 and other changes were added On November 6 2003 version 20 of Americas Army Special Forces was made The Army is spending about USD3 million a year to make more versions of the game 

Another AA version called Americas Army Rise of a Soldier is available on Playstation 2 and Xbox This version was developed by UbiSoft 

Since Americas Army was created people have complained about its purpose People have argued about the Army using its money to make a game They are also worried about how this game will change peoples lives

In Americas Army there are teams of soldiers fighting in a war The person who is playing controls a soldier of the US Army from the characters eyes This is called first person Players fight as either the US Army or Indigenous forces They fight against a team called OPFOR There are different kinds of OPFORs called insurgents enemy forces or terrorists

One of Americas Armys different features is the way the enemies are The players are split into two different teams There is usually an assault group and a defense group The assault loses the round if the time limit runs out which is usually ten minutes

The players on each team see themselves as American soldiers with American weapons such as the M16A2 Their opponents look like non uniformed people with Eastern bloc weapons like the AK 47 In training maps the only distinguishing features are the players uniforms The development team did this to make the game realistic for players on both sides They allowed everyone to play on the side of the good guys They also avoided the problem of asking players to kill American soldiers

On the Special Forces maps players can also play as non uniformed people with Eastern bloc weapons but be on the same team as regular army forces 

This is confusing to many players because when they pick up an enemy weapon it works differently than the US version An AK 47 removed from a fallen opponent is fully automatic more powerful but less accurate than his M16 But when his opponent had it to him it was an M16 The important thing is that each weapon behaves as the owner sees it It transforms when it is picked up If people pay a lot of attention might notice that the enemies weapons behave wrong but it is hard to notice

Every round starts with both teams spawning at the same time Players can join the other team but cannot play as the OPFOR Equipment is not bought but selected through choosing a class

The goal of the game is to complete the objectives kill the enemy team For example one objective could be to kill the VIP who is trying to survive and escape If a player joined the other team he would have to protect the same VIP The round is over if a team wins0 or if the time limit is reached For a listing of missions gohere

The game remembers how many people each player has killed how many times each team has won how many times each player has been killed and how well the player is completing the objectives The game then distributes score which calculates the players Honor level 

Every time a player is killed every time he fails to protect an objective which he is assigned to defend and especially every killing of fellow teammates or his allies caused by friendly fire is called a violation of the ROE in the game and has an extremely negative effect on his score and Honor If too many points are lost in a round the player is put in jail and kicked out of the server As of February 2005 952 of AA players had 0 20 HONOR points 33 had 20 40 points 1 had 40 60 and 4 had 61 80 points 

Every healing of injured teammates and every killing of opponents increases a players score and Honor Completing the games missions affects a players score in a good way and his Honor points as well The score is saved in the players account that was being used Some servers only allow players with certain Honor levels to join The most common is to not let anyone with less than 10 Honor in because this is the base level that everyone starts with Some also do not let players with too much Honor in The developers say that Honor is based on the values of the Army Loyalty Duty Respect Selfless Service Honor Integrity and Personal Courage or Leadership Its main purpose in the game is stop team killing which is a problem in a lot of online first person shooters

The game depicts real guns The guns have all the same traits as the real versions Each gun has different accuracy power recoil and rate of jamming To aim there are cross hairs and iron sights

Players may select a class like squad leader rifleman automatic rifleman grenadier or sniper these classes decide what weapon the player will have at the beginning of each round Some players from each team may be medics Medics can help their teammates get better after they get shot Being a medic is an extra ability which is added to the class The Honor points are used to decide which players gets which class Players with more Honor usually get to pick their class first

Each gun also can jam in action When a gun jams it means that it stops working because a part is stuck The player then needs to press a button to fix the gun This can be a problem because it makes it so that the player cannot shoot for a few seconds AA was the first game ever to have players guns jam

Every firearm in the game has either iron sights or a telescopic sight while using the sights a zoom effect enlarges objects in view The iron sights enlarge to a small degree the telescopic sights to large one Until he stops zooming the players moving speed is additionally decreased

In the first few versions weapons could only hurt players and glass For example a grenade could not destroy a television but a gun could put a bullet hole in the screen Compared to most games the grenades and are more deadly They tried to make the blast radius of grenades more like real life than it usually is in other games Getting hurt by weapons always leads to some bleeding which causes a players health gauge to go down over time Injuries make players slower they also make it harder for the player to shoot where they are aiming Sometimes if the player does not get help from a medic they will die 

In the newer versions of the game players can make changes to their weapons For example the M4 Carbine can be change in different ways and let the soldier have features that work better on a certain map For example on a large map a scope and a bi pod might be picked but in a city a player might choose only iron sights and a M203 grenade launcher

Every player starts the round with one or two guns some grenades and on some maps night vision goggles or binoculars A list of the weapons is here

The map list is sorted by the version they were released with with newer maps coming first The game currently has 28 multiplayer maps and 14 single player training missions Completing these training missions unlocks things like the ability to play online or to become a medic a special forces unit or a sniper Maps have different sizes objectives and weapons that players can have However no known custom maps have been made because there is no level editor for the game and the developers made it impossible for players to use the level design computer program UnrealEd which works for other Unreal engine games

Newest Version is 2831

Version 27 came out June 2006

Version 26 is available for Microsoft Windows Linux and for Mac OS X

Heterosexual people love people of the opposite sex A heterosexual man loves women A heterosexual woman loves men Another less formal word for heterosexual is straight

Heterosexual is seen as different from homosexuality bisexuality or asexuality Most people describe themselves as heterosexual 

A hate crime is when someone breaks a law by hurting another person because of prejudice against a group the victim belongs to Normally a hate crime is not caused in any way by something the victim did or said but just because of who they are Hate crime is often in the form of physical violence but can also be vandalism and damage to property insults or other hurtful words or other violations of human rights People often commit hate crime because of prejudice about the victims sex ethnicity religion nationality gender identity class sexual orientation age or other things about them 

The term hate crime was first used in the 1980s in the United States when crimes caused by bias against certain types of people were being talked about in the media Hate crime is sometimes a way to frighten other people who belong to the same group This intimidation can be seen as terrorism when it is carried out on a large scale

In 2009 the Matthew Shepard Act has changed the definition of a hate crime in the law of the United States It says that crimes which were committed because of the victims sexual orientation gender identity or disability are hate crimes It is the first law that protects transgender people 

Gay bashing is a type of hate crime or hate speech It is where a homosexual person is insulted hurt or killed because of their sexual orientation Gay bushing can include bashing because of transphobia in LGBT rights movement

Emergency Medicine is a specialty of medicine A specialty is a special part of medicine where a doctor may have more knowledge Examples are Pediatrics Geriatrics and Cardiology

Emergency Medicine is sometimes also called Accident and Emergency Medicine 

EM doctors specialize in treating diseases and injuries that need immediate care These kind of diseases or injuries are called emergencies If they are not helped quickly the person may become more sick or even die

Doctors that specialize in EM usually work in Emergency Departments This is also called an Accident and Emergency Ward These are places in hospitals where people go if they have an emergency They may have a red cross or red letters on the sign to show it is the Emergency Department This way even people who cannot read know where to go

Doctors who specialize in EM must know some about all of the different specialties of medicine They treat people of all ages They treat both men and women They must know how to treat any kind of emergency But they may not know quite as much about the chronic treatments of diseases over years However many people come to the Emergency Department with problems that are not emergencies So EM doctors must also know about how to treat non emergencies

Berkeley is a city in the US State of California It is a suburb of San Francisco It is famous for the college University of California Berkeley where many political protests were held in the 1960s It is also famous for its gourmet food and art scenes Also it is the native city of the punk band Green Day BOINC or the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing was created at the University of California in Berkeley

Medicine is a very complex field In the past a doctor could learn almost all that we knew about medicine Now that is impossible So after finishing medical school young doctors choose what kind of doctor they wish to be After school they usually do more years of training to learn about the kind of medical specialty they want to do

Some doctors try to learn some about all of the different subjects of medicine and how to treat all patients These kind of doctors are called primary care doctors Sometimes they are also called generalists or even general practitioners In the United States these kind of doctors are called family practitioners or family medicine doctors

There are other doctors who are also primary care doctors Pediatricians are primary care doctors but only for children Internists are primary care doctors for adults Some gynecologists do primary care but for women only

Other doctors are called specialists This means they have learned more about certain types of medical care A dermatologist is a doctor who knows more about the skin and diseases of the skin A psychiatrist is a doctor who knows more about thought and mood and mental illnesses like depression and schizophrenia An orthopedic surgeon is a doctor who knows about bones and joints and fixes them when they are broken or diseased

In the broadest meaning of medicine there are many different specialties However within medical circles there are two broad categories Medicine and Surgery Medicine refers to the practice of non operative medicine and most subspecialties in this area require preliminary training in Internal Medicine Surgery refers to the practice of operative medicine and most subspecialties in this area require preliminary training in General Surgery There are some specialties of medicine that do not fit into either of these categories such as radiology pathology anaesthesia etc In the US all specialties must pass all three steps of the national medical board examinations After passing these exams further board exams are given specific to each specialty including both written and oral boards After residency is completed and the doctor has been in practice for at least one year and after all these exams have been passed the doctor is considered to be board certified in that particular specialty There are only a certain amount of training spots per specialty each year and therefore some specialties can be very competitive Some medical students do not obtain their first choice of specialty Some specialties suffer from severe shortages of doctors while other specialties suffer from an oversupply of practicing doctors 

Surgical training requires a minimum of five years of residency after medical school Sub specialties of surgery often require seven or more years In addition fellowships can last an additional one to three years Because post residency fellowships can be competitive many trainees devote two additional years to research Thus in some cases surgical training will not finish until more than a decade after medical school Furthermore surgical training can be very difficult and time consuming A surgical residents average work week is approximately 75 hours Some subspecialties of surgery such as neurosurgery require even longer hours and utilize an extension to the 80 hour regulated work week allowing up to 88 hours per week Many surgical programs still exceed this work hour limit Attempts to limit the amount of hours worked has been difficult because of the large volume of patients who require surgical care the limited amount of resources the need to perform long operations and still provide care to all pre and post operative patients and the need to provide constant coverage in the OR ICU and ER

Medical training as opposed to surgical training requires three years of residency training after medical school This can then be followed by a one to two year fellowship in the subspecialties listed above In general resident work hours in medicine are much less than those in surgery

Pediatrics is the specialty of medicine that cares for infants children and adolescents The ages can vary from the early months until 21

Pediatricians can be primary care doctors or they can be specialists

Pediatricians take care of diseases that children get They also make sure that children develop normally and try to prevent illness One of the most important ways that childrens diseases can be prevented is by immunization Immunization is also called vaccination

In the nineteenth century one in five children died before the age of five Most of these deaths were from infectious diseases Today some of these deaths are prevented by treating disease when it happens Most of it is from preventing disease with immunizations

Pediatricians also try to prevent other diseases and injury before they happen They teach parents about safety and nutrition They may teach older children or adolescents about avoiding injury or addiction to alcohol and tobacco Because childhood is such a time of change prevention is a major part of pediatrics

Esperanto is a special language that was designed to be easy to learn It was made in the nineteenth century by Ludovic Lazarus Zamenhof a Polish eye doctor He made it so people from different countries could talk to each other

At first the language was named La Internacia Lingvo which means The International Language But people that learned the language wanted to call it Esperanto which means the one who hopes The name comes from Doktoro Esperanto which is what Zamenhof called himself when he made the first book about Esperanto

People who speak Esperanto are often called Esperantists No one knows exactly how many people now speak Esperanto The most common guesses are between several hundred thousand and 2 million speakers around the world It is estimated that 1000 people know Esperanto from birth There are many couples from 2 different countries with 2 different languages who both know Esperanto so they can understand each other

Many people use Esperanto to communicate by mail email blogs or chat rooms with Esperantists in other countries Some people travel and meet other Esperantists in person

There are many annual meetings The largest is the Universala Kongreso de Esperanto held in a different country each year In recent years it has had around 2000 people from 60 or more countries

There are books and magazines written in Esperanto and much literature translated into Esperanto from other languages This includes famous works such as the Bible and plays by Shakespeare as well as less famous works which do not have English translations

There are bands who sing in Esperanto perform live concerts and sell recordings of their music

Zamenhof wanted to make an easy language to increase international understanding The goal was giving an international communication language that is as a universal second language not to replace national languages This goal was widely shared with Esperanto speakers in the early years of the Esperanto movement After that Esperanto speakers began to see the language and the culture that was shared is owned by themselves even if Esperanto is never chosen by the United Nations or other international organizations

Those Esperanto speakers who want Esperanto to be chosen by organizations or used worldwide are commonly called finvenkistoj from fina venko meaning final victory or pracelistoj from pracelo meaning original goalEsperanto by Mark Feeney The Boston Globe 12 May 1999 Those who focus on the basic value of the language are commonly called ramistoj from Rauma Finland where a statement on the near term not believing in the fina venko and the value of Esperanto culture was made at the International Youth Congress in 1980Kion Signifas Ramismo by Giorgio Silfer These groups are however not from both sides exclusive

The numbers are

Mia means my via means your lia means his So to say how old is somebody in Esperanto just say

Esperanto has over 20 special words which can change meaning of another word Some of them are

This was followed by the success of their psychedelic album Eight Miles High in 1969It was the time of the hippies flower power and Woodstock On this album the most important song was an 18 minute version of the title track The original text and music were written by The Byrds Golden Earrings live version which could last 45 minutes was one of the reasons the young band became very popular in America in the summer of 1969 It was the first time the Golden Earrings did a tour in the USA and they discovered a country where rock music was made in a professional wayThey played with Led Zeppelin Carlos Santana Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton This way they learned a lot and the band slowly was becoming a true hard rock band Golden Earring went on their first major US tour in 1969  1970 Between 1969 and 1984 the band completed thirteen US tours During this period they performed as the opening act for The WhoCarlos Santana Pink Floyd the Doobie Brothers Rush and 38 Special and played together with a lot of other famous musicians After their classic rocksong Radar Love became an international super hit in 1974 Golden Earring even had KISS and Aerosmith as the opening act of their concerts in 1970 Jimi Hendrix wanted bass player Rinus Gerritsen in his Jimi Hendrix Experience But Rinus wanted to stay in his own band so he said no Golden Earring enjoyed a brief period of international stardom but were unable to get further chart success until 1982s Twilight Zone which was followed by The Lady Smiles in 1984 This became a 3 hit in Canada but in the USA the videoclip for this song was banned from MTV because of nudity Golden Earring turned their focus towards Europe where they continue to attract large crowds and continue to perform Golden Earring has recorded over 30 gold and platinum albums and singles and inspired over 200 fellow bands who have covered their 1973 74 international hit and rock classic Radar Love including REM U2 Def Leppard Bryan Adams and White Lion who gave Radar Love a second run in the American charts in 1989

In 1991 they had another hit with Going To The Run a rock ballad about a Hells Angels motorclub member who was a friend of the band and died in a crash The run is how the Angels call their meetings when they go driving their bikes together somewhere The Russian rock band Aria made a successful cover of Going To The Run From 1992 to 2004 the band released three acoustic live unplugged albums which became an instant success Since 1992 the Earring does also acoustic unplugged theater shows which continue to this date and usually sell out The acoustic albums feature unplugged versions of famous hits of the band Golden Earring the same unchanged line up of the same four musicians and friends since 1970 in a band founded in 1961 These two facts show clearly that Golden Earring is the one and only band which may truly carry the title the longest still performing rock n roll band on earth But the four sworn friends from The Hague always keep their head cool as they heat it up night after night in sold out venues and theatres when the crowd goes wild for these four living legends Together they may be rocks best kept secret in the music universe

The band inspired musicians like Rolling Stones and Iron Maiden who are fans of Golden Earring

Golden Earring is perhaps the oldest rock band in the world that is still performing and active on the roadIn March 2009 they will make a comeback in England with concerts in Ipswich and London On the 21st of March a big concert in the Colorline Arena in Hamburg Germany is planned as well as a new CD for which some songs have already been recorded

Golden Earring was one of the first major European rock bands to tour the United States in 1969 They were at first inspired by The Beatles and other typical sixties pop groups like The Kinksin 1966 The Golden Earrings performed together with The Kinks during a legendary concert in The Hague Holland On their first USA tour bands like Led Zeppelin and The Doors inspired Golden Earrings music and professionalism They saw that the Americans had very good soundsystems and electrical equipmentLater they were influenced by Pink FloydSantana Te Who when they performed together during the many American tours Golden Earring didIn total the band has been in over 40 US stateseven Hawaii The Golden earring has used almost all styles you can find in rock and pop music mostly straightforwardrock nowadayslike guitar rock but in many of the over 400 songs they have recorded you can hear influences of hard metal rap disco folk country gospel and even Latin In the past their music was more psychedelic and progressive this you can hear on albums like Moontan Wall of Dolls and Eight Miles High Golden Earring always seeks ways to experiment with new styles and variations in the music they make Usually they are their own producers and have a strong influence in the studio because it is very important to catch the typical Earring sound on tape in the recording studio This is why the band often plays live in the studio that is everybody plays together so the original live sound is approached in the best way possible For information on the instruments the gear and technical equipment the band uses their own website is the best way to go to 

Golden Earring has released music worldwide and enjoyed brief superstar status in the seventies when Radar Love from the album Moontan became a hit in both Europe and the USA Moontan itself was awarded a gold record in the US The ultimate Earring hit song Radar Love has its own website On this site are also found more than 200 covers of this classic rock song which was voted best car song ever by readers of USA Today in 2005 and second best greatest driving song in a poll of BBCs programme Top Gear after Dont Stop Me Now from Queen A number of artists like U2 White Lion REM and Bryan Adams have covered this international hit and rock classic In total over 200 covers exist of this song

George Kooymans wrote Twilight Zone which appeared in 1982 and brought Golden Earring a second international round of success This song was accompanied by one of the first rock videos directed by Dick Maas As the music television channel MTV had just been launched in 1981 the airplay helped Twilight Zone secure a Top Ten hit in the States The song was inspired by the popular TV series The Twilight Zone

When the Lady Smiles from the album News was the next international hit in 1984 again helped by a video It became a top hit in Europe and Canada But it never became a hit in the US because the original video was banned from MTV because of nudity and the rape of a nun In 2008 Hillary Clinton used this song during her campaign to become the democratic candidate for president of the USA

Their best selling albums ever were Moontan of which over 1 million copies were sold worldwide and the unplugged acoustic live CDDVD The Naked Truth in 1992 which sold over 500000 copies in the Netherlands alone and laid the foundation of their successful unplugged theatre tours that started in 1992 and continue to date The first unplugged acoustic live album was followed by Naked II and the trilogy was completed in 2005 with Naked III Live at The Panama During unplugged concerts Rinus the bass player sometimes uses a standing contrabass

Richard Springthorpe known better by his stage name Rick Springfield is an Australian musician and actor He was extremely popular in the 1980s thanks to a string of hit songs including Jesses Girl and a recurring role on the TV show General Hospital

The anus is the opening in the human body that is between the buttocks It is at the end of the gastrointestinal system where feces or stool comes out of the body Sometimes it is quite smelly due to flatulence or feces coming through

An orgasm is a sexual climax or peak Orgasm occurs as a result of continued sexual stimulation During an orgasm there is a strong feeling of excitement and intense physical pleasure Sexual stimulation may be sexual intercourse hand rubbing and squeezing called masturbation or other activities that excite the sex organs During an orgasm a persons body usually spasms and the persons brain activity changes quickly Orgasms may happen when people are asleep When men ejaculate in their sleep this is often called a wet dream

Orgasms happen to other mammals when they have sex in a similar way 

The penis usually becomes hard before an orgasm and softens again after When a man has an orgasm he feels a very strong and enjoyable feeling sometimes throughout his entire body In a man an orgasm usually happens at the same time as an ejaculation which is an involuntary release of semen through the penis Young boys can orgasm but there may be no semen because semen release usually occurs only after puberty has started After an orgasm men usually experience a deep sense of relaxation usually felt in the groin and the thighs Usually the stronger the orgasm the deeper the relaxation and the longer the relaxation will last

A womans orgasm begins in her clitoris which is the counterpart of the mans penis It is preceded by an erection of the clitoris and a moistening of the opening of the vagina When a woman experiences a full orgasm her uterus vagina anus and pelvic muscles undergo a series of rhythmic contractions Most women find these contractions very pleasurable

The prostate is a gland of the male body that adds part of the fluid to semen A healthy human prostate is slightly larger than a walnut It surrounds the urethra just below the urinary bladder

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting elderly men in developed countries and a major cause of death Regular rectal exams are recommended for older men to detect prostate cancer early 

The prostate is often referred to as the male g spot which is a spot inside the female vagina that causes intense pleasure when it is stimulated The prostate can be massaged by using a finger or during anal sex Some males are able to orgasm with prostate stimulation alone

A fossil is the remains or trace of an ancient living thing

Fossils of animals plants or protists occur in sedimentary rock 

In a typical fossil the body form is retained but the original molecules that made up the body have been replaced by some inorganic material such as calcium carbonate or silica The fossil feels like and is made of rock It has been mineralised or petrified 

A fossil may also be an imprint or impression of a living thing remaining in the fossilised mud of a long gone age 

Some organisms fossilise well others do not The most common fossils are those left behind by organisms that produce hard materials The hard calcitic shells of molluscs and of now rare brachiopods are examples These sea dwelling shellfish have produced many fossiliferous chalky layers of limestone in the earth 

Soft bodied organisms can fossilise in special circumstances the Ediacaran biota is a good example 

The best known fossils for the general public are those of the giant prehistoric dinosaurs The fossilized bones and fossilized tracks of these huge ancient reptiles can be seen in many museums of natural history and earth science 

The study of fossils by geologists and biologists is known as paleontology If the study puts living things in their ecological context it is called paleobiology

There are some sites where fossils have been found with remarkable details or in large numbers Palaeontologists call these sites Lagersttten which means in German storage place

Microscopic or very tiny fossils are called microfossils while larger macroscopic fossils such as those of seashells and mammals are called macrofossils Natural stones which look like fossilized organisms but are not fossils at all are called pseudofossils

Indirect evidence of prehistoric life such as a worms trail or an animals footprint is known as a trace fossil Fossilized excrement faeces or dung is known as a coprolite Chemical traces of prehistoric organisms is called a chemofossil Objects made by prehistoric people are called artifacts

Even when the remains of soft bodied animals are gone there may be impressions molds or carbon traces which remain permanently So in special cases we do have fossils even of small soft invertebrate animals 

Sometimes a fossil is produced as a result of dryness freezing or pine resin Mummified animals ice covered wooly mammoths and insect filled amber are examples of such fossils

Living fossils however are not fossils at all Instead they are modern day organisms which very closely resemble their prehistoric ancestors of many millions of years ago The ginkgo tree the coelacanth and the horseshoe crab are good examples

Many pre scientific peoples noticed fossils but not all thought they were the remains of living things Perhaps the first to leave a record of his thought was the Ancient Greek philosopher Xenophanesp387 People wrote about his ideas on fossils

These ideas were rediscovered in the 17th century in Europe Nicolas Steno in the Netherlands and Robert Hooke at the Royal Society in London both wrote and gave lectures about fossils In the 18th century fossil collecting began and serious thinking on geology began to make progress In the 19th century geology became a modern science and fossils played a part in the theory of evolution

Pretty Hate Machine was Nine Inch Nails first album It first came out in 1989 The songs Down In It Head Like A Hole and Sin became famous from the radio and MTV

In 1992 Nine Inch Nails made a short album called Broken It had only eight songs The song Wish won a Grammy a very important award for singers and musicians Another album called Fixed has some of the same songs as Broken but other musicians have changed the music and added new sounds 

A new album called The Downward Spiral came out in 1994 It is the most popular and famous Nine Inch Nails album Music stores have sold more than 4 million copies of The Downward Spiral all together The songs Closer March Of The Pigs and Hurt were very popular on MTV and radio stations Trent Reznor asked many other musicians to make remixes from the songs The remixes were released on a new album called Further Down The Spiral

In 1994 Nine Inch Nails played at the Woodstock 94 concert in New York After that they became one of the most famous bands in the world For five years there were no Nine Inch Nails albums or concerts Many fans worried that the band they liked would stop making music forever

Finally a new album came out in 1999 It was called The Fragile It was the longest album Nine Inch Nails had ever made and the music was very different from the old albums Many of the songs were only music with no words Songs like that are called instrumentals Writers who write about music wrote good things about The Fragile in many magazines and newspapers People knew the music of Nine Inch Nails had changed but many people thought it was better than before

Even though many people liked the album it would still take Trent Reznor another five years to make another one This was due to Trent Reznor drinking and becoming addicted to other drugs He is now healthy Trent also argued with his manager John Malm over how much money he should make The court has agreed with Trent and John is no longer Trents manager

Nine Inch Nails next album was called With Teeth When the song The Hand That Feeds was first played on the radio fans were very happy that Nine Inch Nails had come back The second song on the album to be played on the radio is Only and the third is Every Day Is Exactly The Same

Year Zero came out on April 17 2007 Before it came out there was a game that people could play You could find clues to discover more about the story That kind of game is called an Alternate Reality Game Only one single came out That song is called Survivalism 

On March 2 2008 the albums Ghosts I IV came out It was made of 4 small albums Ghosts 1 2 3 and 4 All the songs on these albums were instrumentals and the first album was free to download from the website or available cheaply to download This was new in the way that music is sold because usually music is sold for lots of money and the money is given to many people most who did not make the music but helped give money to the people who did or sent the music to shops to be sold or made adverts for it

After two months since the release of Ghosts I IV a new album came out called The Slip on May 5 2008 The Slip was released in three formats for free

Trent Reznor makes almost all of the music for Nine Inch Nails He is the only member

When Nine Inch Nails plays at concerts other musicians are also part of the band The musicians who play in Nine Inch Nails are not always the same Now Trent Reznor sings and plays some instruments Robin Finck plays the guitar Justin Meldal Johnsen plays the bass guitar and Ilan Rubin plays the drums 

In remixing a person takes a familiar song splits it into different parts called tracks and changes the songs music instruments layout and or vocals to create a new version of the same song It is called remixing due to mixing being the putting together of all the parts of a song and remixing being the putting together of the parts of the song differently than the original

Remixers that is people who remix are musicians who use a variety of tools primarily electronic to create the new song versions Remixing can be simply moving song parts around it can also be creating new music for an old song lyric The most popular types of remixing are production remixing where new instruments are used with the old song vocal and mashups in which two old songs are mixed together

There are two common kinds of remixing production and mashups

Production remixing requires more musical knowledge than mashups because one must make their own music This music generally is within the same key and has the same rhythm or melody as the old song

Many electronic music artists use computer software to make new music parts called tracks The music parts contain notes which are arranged with a computer program called a sequencer The actual notes are played by instruments usually synthesizers a type of electronic musical instrument that makes sounds by changing the shape of a sound wave It is also possible for a remixer to use a drum sample kit a set of sounds of fake or real drums recorded for use on a computer

Rendering

When the remixer has a proper sequence in the sequencer he or she can then render the audio part or track Rendering requires the sequencer to talk to the musical instrument usually by computer software or a computer to computer talking language called MIDI to an actual electronic keyboard The sequencer tells the instrument which note to play and then the instrument plays the note The sequencer writes this note to a music file on the computer

A mashup is a remixing style in which a remixer takes two songs and mixes them with each other in a clever way to create a new song Usually it is the vocal of the song they want to remix with the other musical parts of an older song

Instead of using a sequencer and a musical instrument a remixer can use either record playing turntables or a computer with an audio sequence editor for example the program named ACID music He or she also needs an audio editor a computer program that allows someone to record sounds into a computer as well as cut them down to smaller bits

Usually a small bit of the old song is cut in an audio editor into a loop a piece of music that when played on repeat does not have any skips or musical pauses This loop is usually called a sample in the world of remixing This sample is then looped in a sequence to create a new sound The remixer then mixes the vocal of another song over that loop

It is also possible that a mashup style remixer will take the entire musical part of one song without its vocal  called an instrumental  and take a vocal from another song without the non voice part  called an acapella and put them together to create one song

Howard Phillips Lovecraft was an American author of fantasy horror and science fiction Lovecraft was from Providence Rhode Island

He wrote many really scary short stories These often were about weird creatures that Lovecraft made up by himself or with his friend August Derleth who wrote mysteries The creatures did not really care about human people at all so they were not out to hurt people but if they did they did not care They looked at us like we would be ants Their behaviour attitude and look also tended to make people go crazy

Hormones are chemicals that are used for messaging in multicellular organisms Every multicellular organism produces hormones The cells that react to a given hormone have special receptors for that hormone When a hormone attaches to the receptor protein a mechanism for signalling is activated 

The messages can be sent to nearby cells or to far away cells If a cell wants to send a message to a nearby cell it puts the hormone into the tissue around it If an animals cell wants to send a message to a far away cell it puts the hormone into the blood When a hormone is put in the blood it goes to all parts of the animals body Sometimes the cell that gets the message can even be the same cell that made the hormone

The cell or tissue that gets the message is called the target cell

Many different kinds of cells can send a message There are some kinds of cells whose main job is to make hormones When many of these cells are together in one place it is called a gland Glands are groups of cells that make something and release it Some glands make hormones

Endocrine means something that is made by cells and released into the blood or tissue So endocrine glands form hormones and release them into the blood or tissue The opposite word is exocrine and means released outside of the body An example of exocrine is sweat glands or saliva glands When people say endocrine they usually mean glands that make hormones 

Hormones do many things They regulate metabolism Metabolism is all of the chemical and energy reactions that happen in a living thing Hormones cause the growth and death of cells and of whole organisms Hormones also start and control sexual development For example the hormones estrogen and progesterone make girls puberty Hormones help keep homeostasis in an organism Homeostasis means to keep a constant state inside the body like temperature amount of water and salts and amount of sugar Hormones released by one gland can also tell other glands to make different hormones

There are four types of hormones in most animals They are grouped by the chemicals from which they are made When scientists say hormones are derived from it means they are made from something by changing it These changes are chemical changes

In biology regulation means to control something So regulating hormones means controlling how much hormones are made and released from cells

Hormone regulation is mostly done by negative feedback

In negative feedback a hormone causes an effect The cells that make the hormone detect this effect Upon detection of the hormone its production ceases

A good example of negative feedback is with the hormone insulin Insulin is produced by the pancreas Insulin is released by the pancreas in response to consumption of glucose The amount of glucose in the blood rises and the pancreas detects this increase It then secretes insulin into the blood Insulin increases glucose uptake in target cells Some glucose is used by the cells but some is also converted to and stored in the form of glycogen Glucose uptake by cells decreases blood glucose levels  this decrease is detected by the pancreas and in response it stops secreting insulin in to the bloodstream As insulin levels in the blood decrease as does glucose uptake by cells

This negative feedback therefore helps to maintain normal blood glucose levels and prevents extreme changes 

There are two main types of hormones steroid hormones  these are non polar and do not need a receptor The other is peptide hormones

Sometimes two or more hormones control the same thing For example blood glucose is very important to an organism So it is not controlled by just one hormone Other hormones also make the glucose level go up or down If the glucose level gets too low the body releases hormones that do the opposite of insulin They do not tell the cells in the body to take up glucose from the blood They tell the cells to put glucose back into the blood These kind of hormones that work opposite of other hormones are called counter regulatory hormones Counter regulatory hormones for insulin are glucagon and epinephrine

Most important things in an organism are kept in homeostasis by negative feedback and counter regulatory hormones However a few things are controlled in different ways One rare way is positive feedback In negative feedback the hormones effect makes a gland stop making hormones In positive feedback the opposite happens The effect of the hormone tells the gland to make even more hormones

Testosterone is an androgen sex steroid hormone A steroid hormone is one that is made from cholesterol A sex hormone is one that regulates sexual changes in the body An androgen is the male type of sex hormone

The testicles of men make lots of testosterone Ovaries and adrenal glands make testosterone too But they make much less than the testicles do So men have much higher testosterone levels than women 

An infectious disease is a sickness that happens when an organism is attacked by a pathogen Pathogens are too small to see Some infectious diseases are contagious which means that the sick plant animal or person can get other things sick The pathogen can get from one organism to another through air food water blood or physical touch

Usually the sick organism heals Then the organisms body learns how to fight the pathogen If the pathogen attacks again the immune system knows how to fight it Thanks to the immune system people can not get the same disease twice When an organisms body knows how to fight a disease the body is immune to that pathogen

Here are some types of pathogens

Infectious disease is a large cause of pain and death The World Health Organization says that infectious diseases cause about 25 of all deaths These three pathogens cause the most deaths HIV Tuberculosis and Malaria

A patio is a paved area in a garden often used for barbeques or relaxing outside

Cholera is an infectious disease It is caused by a bacterium Vibrio cholerae This bacteria usually lives in water Vibrio cholera is more common where fresh water mixes with salt water like where rivers enter the ocean It is more common in water with lots of algae

Cholera is an acute intestinal illness It causes stomach aches very watery and continuous diarrhea and vomiting The diarrhea and vomiting in turn can cause very bad dehydration leading to death if untreated

Cholera is contracted by eating foods andor drinking water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio Cholerae

Often people get cholera from eating fish that is not cooked enough They can also get it if they eat food or drink that was polluted with the diarrhoea from people who have cholera The most common symptoms of cholera are dehydration and fever

The most common way people get Cholera is by drinking unclean water

People with cholera need medical treatment Most of the treatment for cholera is giving people fluids and electrolytes For most people with cholera fluids and electrolytes are given by mouth This can be done with 80 90 of people The best way to give this by mouth is WHO ORS World Health Organization Oral Rehydration Solution

Some people cannot take enough fluids and electrolytes by mouth Usually this is because vomiting is so bad These people must be given treatment intravenously This is necessary because if people cannot drink enough fluids and electrolytes they can die quickly

Cholera can be stopped by three steps

Mandriva is a Linux distribution

Mandriva was first made public by a French software company MandrakeSoft Its first release was based on Red Hat Linux 51 and was released in July 1998 Mandriva Linux was originated by Gal Duval and intended to focus on ease of use for new users 

From its first release to version 80 Mandrake named its flagship distribution Linux Mandrake From version 81 to 92 it was called Mandrake Linux

In February 2004 MandrakeSoft lost a court case against Hearst Corporation owners of King Features Syndicate Hearst claimed that MandrakeSoft infringed upon King Features trademarked character Mandrake the Magician As a precaution MandrakeSoft renamed its products by removing the space between the brand name and the product name and changing the first letter of the product name to lower case thus creating one word Starting from version 100 Mandrake Linux became known as Mandrakelinux and its logo changed accordingly Similarly MandrakeMove became Mandrakemove

Since 2007 Mandriva is released on a 6 month fixed release cycle similar to Ubuntu and Fedora However while newer features are added per release the core internalsClarifymedateMay 2008 of the Spring release are the same as the first release so as to ensure the stability of a yearly release

The latest stable version is Mandriva Linux 2009 released on 2008 10 09

The development tree of Mandriva Linux has always been known as Cooker This tree is directly released as a new stable version

The current release is named 20091 and was released in April 2009

Action theory is an area in philosophy that talks about theories about the processes that cause intentional human body movements

Some Philosophers ask the question What is an action or What makes somebody do an action Here are two theories

Some philosophers say that an action is caused by a person wanting something and thinking that by doing that action they can get it For example if I want an apple and think that by walking to a table with some apples on it I can get one then I will walk to the table It is important to have both a want and a thought about how to get it If I think that by walking to a table with some apples on it I can get an apple but want an orange and not an apple then I will not walk to the table If I want an apple but think that the table across the room is just a picture of a table then I will not walk to the table

Other philosophers say that the want think theory is not true They say that it is my brain and my nerves that causes an action They see the brain as working like a computer that directs small electric packages from some nerves to other nerves and stores some for a while in memory These packages cannot be named they are just like computer bits and bytes These philosophers say that we talk about what we want and what we think because the brain is very complicated and we do not understand it yet

These questions form part of the philosophy of mind

Xiangqi is a form of chess that started in China In English it is called Chinese chess 

Though derived from the original Indian Chaturanga Chinese chess is quite different from modern international chess The board is different there are different pieces and they have different moves The general and his mandarin may not leave the nine pointed fortress they have only limited movement Clearly this is more similar to the old Indo Arabic game than to modern chess 

Xiangqi is a chess game for two people to play Each player has 16 pieces to move on the board One players set is red and one is black The way to win is to kill the other players Jiang Each kind of piece has different ways to move Xiangqi is one of the most popular chess games in Chinap78

A governor is the leader of a state or a province For instance in the United States of America each of the 50 states has a governor The governor is responsible for the states administrative processes In Pakistan the provincial governor is appointed by the President of Pakistan acting as the ceremonial head of the provinces

The United States Republican Party is one of the two biggest political parties in the United States of America The other large party is the Democratic Party The United States also has many other small parties known as third parties

The Republicans are often called the right or conservatives The Republican Party itself is also known as the GOP which stands for Grand Old Party The symbol of the Republican party is the elephant This symbol was first used in 1874 in a political cartoon 

The Republican National Committee is the main organization for the Republican Party in all 50 states Reince Priebus is the current RNC Chairman

The Republican Party is not the same political party as the Democratic Republican Party

The Republican Party was founded in Ripon Wisconsin in 1854 Its formation was based around opposition to the Kansas Nebraska Act of 1854 which would allow each territory to allow slavery if they wanted to It was founded by previous members of the Free Soil Party and the Whig Party They wanted to stop the expansion of slavery because they believed that it was against the ideals of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence Some founders wanted to abolish slavery everywhere in the United States The first Republican candidate for president was John C Fremont in 1856

As the Whig Party collapsed the Republicans became the second major party In 1860 Abraham Lincoln the first Republican president was elected For the rest of the second half of the 19th century the country had mostly Republican presidents From 1860 until 1912 the Republicans lost the presidential election just twice

Republicans believed in protectionism during the second half of the 19th century and during the early half of the 20th century 

After World War I the 1920s had 3 Republican presidents Warren Harding Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover It was called the Republican Decade for that reason Harding and Coolidge made a plan for the economy which lowered taxes cut government spending and regulated the economy less

Near the end of the decade the stock market crashed and the Great Depression was beginning During the Great Depression Republicans lost popularity and Democrats came into power and remained in power until 1953 when Dwight Eisenhower began his first of two consecutive terms as president Richard Nixon lost the election in 1960 but was elected president on the Republican ticket in 1968 and again in 1972 

Ronald Reagan an actor who has been a conservative political activist for decades was elected as president in 1980 This began a conservative era which would last until 1992 He served two terms and his successor George HW Bush served one term Reagan renewed many ideas which had been left behind in the past such as limited government in the economy and strengthening the military 

Bill Clinton was elected president in 1992 but a new Congress was elected in 1994 and Republicans gained control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate They voted against many of Clintons ideas and proposed ideas of their own such as a line item veto and a balanced budget amendment

The Republicans lost control of Congress during 2006 Democrat Barack Obama was elected in 2008 Those two factors weakened the conservative movement

Currently the Republican Party is identified as conservative and right wing

Not all Republicans believe in all of the same things but generally these are the things many Republicans support

The US Democratic Party is one of two big political parties in the United States The other is the Republican Party The US also has several smaller political parties known as third parties  Supporters of this party are known as Democrats

Every four years the party holds a National Convention where they agree on their candidate for President The Democratic National Committee coordinates most of the activities of the Democratic party in all 50 United States The last National Convention was in Denver Colorado in 2008 where Barack Obama was nominated for President and Joe Biden was nominated for Vice President

The Democratic Party is one of the oldest political parties in the world Most historians agree that it first became a party with the Democratic Republican Party created by Thomas Jefferson in the 1790s The other political party in the USA then was called the Federalists created by Alexander Hamilton Jefferson first called his party the Republican Party because it believed the USA should be a republic instead of a direct democracy The name of the party was changed to Democratic Republican in 1798

In 1828 Andrew Jackson was elected President He was a new kind of politician who got support from many different kinds of people especially poor and working people in the country rather than just from rich people in the city He changed his partys name to the Democratic Party because he believed in democracy He is called the first President of the United States from the modern Democratic Party

The Democratic Party at that time stood on a platform that government should be limited Many Democrats supported expansion opposed the federal government interfering with state governments and opposed a national bank like Jackson did

During the Civil War some members of the Democratic Party supported the Confederate States of America but many others in the party did not This led to a weak and confused party that lost many elections after the war was over After the Civil War the Republicans dominated the government until 1933 

Democrat Woodrow Wilson was elected in 1912 but after World War I the Republicans dominated the government during the 1920s

The next Democratic President was Franklin D Roosevelt who was elected in 1932 during the Great Depression Roosevelt was one of the most popular Presidents of all time and he is the only one who has ever won four terms in office During these years Democrats had big majorities in Congress 

Roosevelt created a series of government programs called the New Deal During the New Deal the government created many jobs for people and made many reforms to the economy The Democratic Partys beliefs have changed since then Before the New Deal they favored limited government From after the New Deal to now they support the government managing the economy and helping disadvantaged people

After World War II Democrats had big majorities again in both houses of Congress until the election of 1994 when the Republicans regained majorities in both the House and Senate 

Republicans held a majority of seats in the House or Senate between 1995 and 2007 Between 2007 and 2011 Democrats controlled both the House and Senate In 2011 Republicans regained control of the House

After Al Gore lost the 2000 presidential election and John Kerry lost in 2004 the nominee for the Democratic Party Senator Barack Obama won the presidency in the year 2008 In doing so he became the first ever African American President of the United States

Sometimes Democrats are called the left liberals or progressives even though not all Democrats are left wing or liberal Many Democrats particularly in the South and Rocky Mountains of the United States are conservative or moderate In the United States each of the parties are a large coalition that covers many different kinds of ideology 

Generally Democrats support

 progressive income tax increasing overall tax income

 higher corporate taxes and recapturing income from overseas profits

 expanding spending on government programs

 spending on business education infrastructure clean energy

 abortion

 stem cell research 

 reducing the involvement of US troops in international affairs downsizing the military

 equal rights thru Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity laws

 restrictions of weapons use through government oversight

 Keynesian Marxist and mixed economics 

 universal healthcare 

 regulating business and the economy

 freedom FROM religion

Most support for Democrats comes from states in the Northeast Midwest and Pacific Coast areas of the USA but there are Democrats elected to office in all other states too

The symbol of the Democratic Party is the Donkey Since the election of 2000 the color blue has become a symbol for DemocratsfactdateJanuary 2012

Taste is one of the five senses Taste is what a human or animal feels on the tongue when food is in the mouth

Bitter tastes are usually thought of as a bad or undesirable taste Many common foods are bitter like coffee bitter melon olives and citrus peel The taste buds on the back of your tongue are the ones that can taste bitter foods the most

Bitterness is of interest to those who study evolution as well as various health researchers since amany naturally bitter compounds are toxic The ability to detect bitter tasting toxic compounds at low thresholds is an important protective function Plant leaves often contain toxic compounds yet even amongst leaf eating primates there is a tendency to prefer immature leaves which tend to be higher in protein and lower in fiber and poisons than mature leaves Amongst humans various food processing techniques are used worldwide to detoxify otherwise inedible foods and make them palatable 

Animals which eat a lot of bitter plant material as browsers do have ways of dealing with it They produced tannin binding proteins which other animals do not Tannins are bitter compounds common in material from trees and bushes but not grass

Saltiness is felt when there is sodium in the food A common spice that is salty is common salt sodium chloride

Savoriness first discovered in 2000 is the taste of savory foods It is also called by the Japanese word  and comes from umai which means yummy To taste savoriness your tongue has special parts that detect amino acids that are in foods like meats and cheeses

Sourness is tasted when acids are on your tongue Many foods have acid in them and are sour like lemons and vinegar

Sweetness is a taste felt when sugars are in the food Most people consider sweetness to be a pleasant taste

The tongue can also feel other sensations not generally included in the basic tastes These are largely detected by the somatosensory system

Also it is known that smell and sight contribute to the overall sensation of eating and drinking The temperature of food makes a difference to its appreciation 

The strange coolness of spearmint menthol and camphor is caused by their molecules triggering a sensory system which normally works to sense low temperatures

There is still much to learn about the taste system Consider for example the tastes of ginger and horseradish

Touch is one of the five main senses that animals have It can be called the somatic or haptic sense The system also includes a number of internal sensory receptors and includes sensing temperature and pain There is a special area in the brain devoted to processing haptic input It is in the parietal lobe of the cerebral cortex

An animal knows if something is against a part of its body This is called the sense of touch The process of touching something may be called feeling

Tiny touch sense organs under the skin help animals feel hardness softness and sharpness for example Animals also have sense organs which feel temperature and pain Some parts of the body such as fingertips have many more sense organs than others

When animals touch things nerve fibres attached to the sense organ sends messages to the brain through the central nervous system The brain interprets the messages and animals feel things 

Humans and mammals in general often touch each other Touch is a kind of non verbal communication Behaviours based on touch are very important for keeping family and group members together It is part of the glue of their social life Monkeys grooming each others fur is a good example

Mechanics is a part of physics It says what happens when forces act on things There are two parts of mechanics The two parts are classical mechanics and quantum mechanics Classical mechanics is used most of the time It is good to say what happens to most of the things we can see Some of the time for example when the things are too small classical mechanics is not good Then we need to use quantum mechanics

Newtons three laws of motion are important to classical mechanics Isaac Newton made them

The first law says that if there is no external force things that are stopped will stay stopped or un moving and things that are moving will keep moving Before people thought that things stopped if there was no force present Often people say Objects that are stopped tend to stay stopped and objects that are moving tend to stay moving unless acted upon by an outside force such as gravity friction etc

The second law says how a force moves a thing The force on a object equals the rate of change of the speed momentum 

The third law says that if one thing puts a force on another thing the second thing also puts a force on the first thing For example if you jump forward off a boat the boat moves backward Often people say For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction

In physics kinematics is the part of classical mechanics that explains the movement of objects without looking at what causes the movement or what the movement affects

1 Dimensional Kinematics are used only when an object moves in one direction either side to side or up and down There are equations with can be used to solve problems that have movement in only 1 dimension or direction These equations come from the definitions of velocity acceleration and distance

2 Dimensional kinematics is used when motion happens in both the x direction and the y direction There are also equations for this type of kinematics However there are different equations for the x direction and different equations for the y direction Galileo proved that the velocity in the x direction does not change through the whole run However the y direction is affected by the force of gravity so the y velocity does change during the run

Moai are stone statues on Easter Island Each moai is made out of one large stone but some have an extra stone on top of the head Most were made from the volcanic rock in the Rano Raraku area of the island Moai are sometimes called heads but they do have shoulders arms and a body but these are usually too small for the head also some of the best known ones had been partly buried over the years and only the heads were showing Most moai are between 25 and 10 metres high and usually weigh 14 tonnes There are about 1000 moai placed mainly around the coast of the island plus nearly 400 more which were left not yet finished at Rano Raraku

When why and how they were made is still a mystery today It is believed that they were made almost 1000 years ago by Polynesians who lived there at the time and were made to honour their ancestors and bring good luck Making the statues would have needed a lot of time and effort To move them they may have used wooden sledges or rollers or even walked them by rocking the moai along The youngest moai found was built around 1350 It is believed that around that time there began a time of cold weather little food and war between the peoples By the 19th century all the moai had been pushed over Today some have been restored

Diogenes of Sinope was an Ancient Greek philosopher His birth place is Sinope He was born about 412 BC Some people say he was born about 399 BC He died in 323 BC at Corinth There is a book by Diogenes Lartius The book tells us that Diogenes of Sinope died on the same day on which Alexander the Great died at Babylon He was a founder of the philosophy called cynicism He is also considered to be the first to use the word cosmopolitan

A vaccination is a treatment which makes the body resist a particular infection

By giving someone a vaccine the substance that makes their immune system react The immune system is the way a body fights infection The immune systems reaction makes someone less likely to get that infection 

If the vaccinated person get exposed to the virus or bacteria that causes the disease the person will fight it and may not get sick

Another word used for using vaccines is immunization These words mean things that are a little different Vaccination is when a person is given something to make the immune system learn to fight an infectious disease

Immunization is when a persons immune system learns to fight an infection Immunization can happen from vaccination But immunization can also happen from getting the infection For example a person can be immune to hepatitis B if he gets sick with hepatitis B After a person gets hepatitis B and then gets well he is immunized from getting it again A person can also be immunized from to hepatitis B by taking the hepatitis B vaccination

So vaccination and immunization have meanings that are a little different But when people say these words they usually mean the same thing People say immunization to mean the same thing as vaccination

The first use of the term vaccine is credited to Dr Edward Jenner The word is derived from the Latin vacca meaning cow A virus that mainly affects cows was used in the first scientific demonstration that giving a person one virus could protect against a related and more deadly one

The first vaccination ever was for smallpox In 1796 an English doctor Edward Jenner noticed something He saw that people who got cowpox did not get sick from smallpox He gave a young boy the cowpox virus to protect him from smallpox This was done by scratching liquid from cowpox sores into the boys skin This same method using liquid from sores was also used to give people smallpox People did this so they might get smallpox on one place on their body Then they could pick which body part got scars from smallpox But sometimes people who did this got very sick from smallpox Some even died This was a dangerous thing to do But people did it because it was less dangerous then getting smallpox

Edward Jenner gave the boy cowpox in the same way people tried to give smallpox Six weeks later he scratched smallpox into the boys skin The boy did not get sick from smallpox This boy was the first person ever to get a vaccination

It was not until almost 100 years after the smallpox vaccination that medicine found the next vaccination In 1879 the vaccine for cholera was found Since then vaccines for 28 different diseases have been found

Herd immunity is an important part of how vaccines work A herd is a group of animals Herd immunity happens when most of the animals in a group are immune to an infection If most animals are immune they cannot get the disease If they do not get the disease they cannot give it to other animals So even one animal who is not immune is safer If none of the other animals in a herd get the infection they cannot give the infection to the one who is non immune

This is important in people too If 95 of people in a place are immune to a disease the other 5 are safer There will just not be as much of that disease around to get

The people who are in the 5 are there for many reasons Some got the vaccine but did not react to it Their immune system did not learn how to fight it well Some of them are too sick to get the vaccine It can be children who are too sick with other diseases to get vaccines It can be a pregnant woman who cannot get the vaccine because it could hurt her baby It can be a person with cancer who does not have a strong immune system It can be an older person who has a weak immune system

So if everyone in a place gets vaccinated it protects these people too If they are not protected by herd immunity they can get more sick from an infection They get the infection more easily and they get sicker from it So it is important that people who are healthy get their vaccinations It protects the healthy people But it also is important to protect other people who are old weak or sick

There are different types of vaccines

Some people argue against vaccination They believe giving people vaccination causes more sickness than it stops Today in modern countries most people are vaccinated Because most people are vaccinated much fewer people get sick from the infections that vaccines stop So most people do not think about the risk of getting sick Many young doctors have not even seen some of these diseases

Vaccines also can make people very sick Almost all people who get a vaccination do not get sick from it Some people get a little sick They may get fever or feel sick This gets better in a few days A very very small number of people can get very sick So people see that vaccines can make people sick But they do not see how sick more people would be if we did not vaccinate people So they only think about the risks vaccines cause They do not think as much about the risks of not giving vaccinations

Some people chose not to get vaccinations because of the small risks Parents may not give their children vaccines These people also depend on herd immunity If most children do not get mumps children who do not get the mumps vaccine are also safe But if enough children do not get the mumps vaccine or if the vaccine does not work as well as expected mumps comes back afflicting older people for whom the disease is more severe That would be called an epidemiological shift Then all people who are not immune may get sick These might be healthy people who chose not to get the vaccine They might get sick but will usually get well Sick people who depend on herd immunity will also get sick Some may get very sick and even die

All medical organizations say that vaccines are safe They say vaccines stop much more sickness than they make The World Health Organization the American Medical Association the American Academy of Pediatrics and the United States Centers for Disease Control all support vaccination

The Vice President of the United States of America is the second in command to the President The President is the commander in chief The Vice Presidents responsibilities include filling in for the President and acting as president of the US Senate Like the President the Vice President serves a term of four years and can be re elected once The Vice President must meet the same requirements as the President being born a US citizen at least 35 years old and must have lived in the United States for 14 years The current Vice President is Joe Biden

Originally the Vice President was the person who got the second most electoral votes in the presidential election This worked well until Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied in election of 1800 After that the 12th Amendment to the US Constitution said that the President and Vice President are elected separately and if nobody clearly won he would be chosen by the Senate 

Soon after that political parties began running the President and Vice President on one platform As such the Vice Presidential candidates are usually chosen by the leadership of a political party with a strong influence by that partys presidential candidate The Vice President and President are usually from the same political party

The Vice President only has one official duty That is to preside over the Senate and to cast a vote in the Senate if there is a tie However recently the duties have been seen to include being a member of the Presidents Cabinet or a top advisor to the President The Vice President is a member of the National Security Council and serves on the board of the Smithsonian Also the 25th Amendment says that the Vice President can act as President if the President is incapacitated For example Vice President George HW Bush acted as President when Ronald Reagan was having an operation

Prior to 1967 if the President died it was unclear whether the Vice President was President or merely Acting President Also if the Vice President died nobody was Vice President until a new one was elected This was changed after the assassination of John F Kennedy with the 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution If the President died the Vice President was clearly the President Also if the Vice President dies resigns or becomes President the President can appoint a Vice President if he is confirmed by a majority vote of both the House of Representatives and the US Senate This has happened twice first after Gerald Ford became Vice President after the resignation of Spiro Agnew and second after Nelson Rockefeller became Vice President after Gerald Ford became President when Richard Nixon resigned

The following Vice Presidents either became President after the death or resignation of the President or were elected in their own right

Toad the Wet Sprocket is a folkpop group from the US state of California They formed in 1986 while they were in high school Their name comes from a monologue performed by Eric Idle called Rock Notes on the 1980 album Monty Pythons Contractual Obligation Album

Boyz II Men is an American boy band from Philadelphia Pennsylvania They were popular in the early 1990s Founded in 1988 as a quintet Boyz II Men found fame as a quartet with members Nathan Morris Michael McCary Shawn Stockman and Wanya Morris on Motown Records during the early 1990s

Based on sales Boyz II Men is the most successful RB male vocal group of all time It has recorded five 1 RB hits between 1992 and 1997 and has since sold more than 90 million albums and 50 million singles Three of its 1 hits End of the Road Ill Make Love to You and One Sweet Day set and broke records for the longest period of time a single remained at 1 on the Billboard Hot 100

John Lester Johnny Nash Jr is an American reggae and soul singer He was born in Houston Texas USA

His biggest hit was I Can See Clearly Now in 1972

In his late teens Johnny Nash came to the attention of Arthur Godfrey and put in many appearances on his TV show He also had a featured role in the motion picture Take A Giant Step Johnny began recording for the ABC Paramount label and under the guidance of arranger producer Don Costa he made a number of albums of standards Including Johnny Nash Lets Get Lost The Quiet Hour Studio Time and I Got Rhythm Even though he possessed a superb singing voice it seems that in the early 1960s all young black male ballad singers were overshadowed by another Johnny Johnny Mathis Johnny Nash never really came into the forefront of pop music He made a couple of obscure jazz tinged albums for the Argo label Then after being off the scene for a couple of years he emerged with a new music genre the reggae soul and caribbean type song stylings This was the mid 70s and he found new fans and a new popularity

Linda Ronstadt is an American singer and entertainer She has won ten Grammy Awards and many other awards

The heart is a muscle found in every animal that has a backbone It is a very strong muscle that is about the size of a fist It pumps blood throughout the body It has regular contractions or when the heart squeezes the blood out into other parts of the body 

Cardiac and cardio both mean mean about the heart so if something has the prefix cardio or cardiac it has something to do with the heart

Myocardium means the heart muscle

The human heart has four chambers or closed spaces Some animals have only two or three chambers

In humans the four chambers are two atria and two ventricles Atria is talking about two chambers atrium is talking about one chamber There is a right atrium and right ventricle These get blood that comes to the heart They pump this blood to the lungs In the lungs blood picks up oxygen and drops carbon dioxide Blood from the lungs goes to the left atrium and ventricle The left atrium and ventricle send the blood out to the body The left ventricle works six times harder than the right ventricle because it carries oxygenated blood

Blood is carried in blood vessels These are arteries and veins Blood going to the heart is carried in veins Blood going away from the heart is carried in arteries The main artery going out of the right ventricle is the pulmonary artery The main artery going out of the left ventricle is the aorta

The veins going into the right atrium are the superior vena cava and inferior vena cava These bring blood from the body to the right heart The veins going into the left atrium are the pulmonary veins These bring blood from the lungs to the left heart

When the blood goes from the atria to the ventricles it goes through heart valves When blood goes out of the ventricles it goes through valves The valves make sure that blood only goes one way in or out

The four valves of the heart are

The heart has three layers The outer covering is the pericardium This is a tough sack that surrounds the heart The middle layer is the myocardium This is the heart muscle The inner layer is the endocardium This is the thin smooth lining of the chambers of the heart

A heart beat is when the heart muscle contracts This means the heart pushes in and this makes the chambers smaller This pushes blood out of the heart and into the blood vessels After the heart contracts and pushes in the muscle relaxes or stops pushing in The chambers get bigger and blood coming back to the heart fills them

When the heart muscle contracts it is called systole When the heart muscle relaxes this is called diastole Both atria do systole together Both ventricles do systole together But the atria do systole before the ventricles Even though the atrial systole comes before ventricular systole all four chambers do diastole at the same time This is called cardiac diastole

The order is atrial systole ventricular systole cardiac diastole When this happens one time it is called a cardiac cycle

Systole happens because the muscle cells of the heart gets smaller in size When they get smaller we also say they contract Electricity going through the heart makes the cells contract The electricity starts in the sino atrial node The SA Node is a group of cells in the right atria These cells start an electrical impulse This electrical impulse travels through the atria making them contract This motion is called atrial systole Once electrical impulse goes through the atrio ventricular node The AV Node makes the impulse slow down Slowing down makes the electrical impulses get to the ventricles later That is what makes the ventricular systole occur after atrial systole and lets all the blood leave the atria before ventricle contracts 

After the electrical impulse goes through the AV Node the electrical impulse will go through the conduction system of the ventricle Conduction means heat or electricity traveling through something This brings the electrical impulse to the ventricles The first part of the conduction system is the bundle of His His is named for the doctor who discovered it Bundle means strings or wires grouped together in parallel Once the bundle goes through the ventricle muscle it divides into two bundle branches the left bundle branch and the right bundle branch The left bundle branch travels to the left ventricle and the right bundle branch travels to the right ventricle At the end of the bundle branches the electrical impulse goes into the ventricular muscle through the Purkinje Fibers This is what makes ventricle contraction take place and makes ventricular systole

The order is Sino Atrial Node Atria Atrio Ventricular Node Bundle of His Bundle branches Purkinje Fibers Ventricles

ECG is an acronym for ElectroCardioGram It is also written EKG for ElectroKardioGram in German The ECG shows what the electricity in the heart is doing An EKG is done by putting electrodes on a persons skin The electrodes see the electricity going through the heart This is written on paper by a machine This writing on the paper is the ECG

Doctors learn about the persons heart by looking at the ECG The ECG shows some diseases of the heart like heart attacks or problems with the rhythm of the heart

The ECG shows atrial systole This is called a P wave Then ventricular systole happens This is called the QRS or QRS complex It is called a complex because there are three different waves in it The Q wave R wave and S wave Then the ECG shows ventricular diastole This is called the T wave Atrial diastole happens then too But it is not seen separate from ventricular diastole

The PR Interval is the space between atrial systole and ventricular systole The QT Interval is from when the QRS starts to when the T ends The ST segment is the space between the QRS and T

Heart disease is a general term that means that the heart is not working normally 

Babies can be born with heart disease This is called congenital heart disease If people get heart disease later it is called acquired heart disease Most heart disease is acquired

The three most common types of acquired heart disease are 

A person can have heart disease and not feel sick Some people with heart disease have symptoms This is when there are changes or pain in the body to show a disease is there Some symptoms of heart disease are

Heart disease is the biggest killer of both men and women in the United States England Wales and Canada For example heart disease causes 4 out of every 10 deaths in the United States this is more than all kinds of cancer put together Also one person dies of heart disease every 34 seconds in the United States alone

Congenital heart disease refers to a form of heart problem that starts before birth Congenital heart disease includes a large number of conditions The formation of the heart before birth is a very complex and is sometimes abnormal For example if a part of the main artery that comes from the heart is narrowed that is called coarctation of the aorta There may be holes inside the heart which keep the blood from flowing normally inside the heart Other congenital heart problems are caused by abnormal heart valves In some cases congenital heart problems are discovered at birth other times the problems may not be detected until the person is an adult

North Dakota is one of the United States 642200 people lived in North Dakota in the year 2000 The capital and seat of government is Bismarck

North Dakota is south of Manitoba and Saskatchewan east of Montana north of South Dakota and west of Minnesota Manitoba and Saskatchewan are provinces  part of Canada Montana South Dakota and Minnesota are other states in the United States 

North Dakota is not close to any big bodies of water Because of this temperatures in North Dakota are very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter In the summer there are sometimes strong thunderstorms These storms can have tornadoes and hail

Before European people came Native American people lived in the area now called North Dakota One important tribe was the Mandan

North Dakota was one of the last US states to be settled On November 2 1889 North Dakota became part of the United States

Most of the economy is based on agriculture The most important agricultural crops are durum a type of wheat which is grown all across the state In the Red River Valley there is more rain and maize and sugar beets are grown as well In the Badlands there is less rain and more cattle are raised than crops

North Dakota has the only bank in the United States that is owned by the state The Bank of North Dakota is where all of the money from all government agencies is held Most banks in the United States are guaranteed by the FDIC The FDIC guarantees that people will not lose money if a bank fails But the Bank of North Dakota is insured by the state of North Dakota

LGBT is an acronym It means Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender 

Some people make this acronym longer They put other letters at the end

So it can be written LGBTIQTS Some people add Ally Not everyone agrees what should be in the acronym

This is a community A community is a group of people who have something in common It can also be referred to as the queer community

People who are LGBT are either

or

This word and idea of LGBT also used documents of international law on human rights such as the Declaration of Montreal the Yogyakarta Principles 

The acronym LGBTI is always used in the Activists Guide to the Yogyakarta Principles 

The rainbow flag is a multi colored flag consisting of stripes in the colors of the rainbow that is displayed in many cultures around the world as a sign of diversity and inclusiveness The German pastor Thomas Mntzer used a rainbow flag as a symbol of solidarity as early as the German Peasants War of the 16th century It is common as a symbol of the Peace movement first used this way in a peace march in Italy in 1961

In 1924 the Indian spiritual teacher Meher Baba designed a rainbow flag It is flown each year near his tomb near Ahmednagar India during the anniversary of his death on January 31 1969 Baba explained the symbolism saying The colors in the flag signify mans rise from the grossest of impressions of lust and anger symbolized by red to the culmination in the highest state of spirituality and oneness with God symbolized by sky blue 

The rainbow is also a symbol in the Christian and Jewish Bible It shows Gods promise to Noah and his family to never cover the world in water again

A Christian movement known as Cursillo founded in 1944 uses these traditional rainbow symbols including flags Their version can have 5 to 7 colors with red at the top blue or purple at the bottom and the Spanish words De Colores in large letters on the front

This rainbow flag in Italy was first used in a peace march in 1961 inspired by similar multi coloured flags used in demonstrations against nuclear weapons The most common variety has seven colours purple blue light blue green yellow orange and red and is emblazoned in bold with the Italian word PACE meaning peace 

Since 1978 the rainbow flag is also the symbol of the LGBT community It is also called the Pride Flag

The flag was first used at a LGBT pride parade in San Francisco in 1978 The flag started with eight colors The next year it was changed to six colors so it could be easier to make

The flag was first made by Gilbert Baker It was to use instead of the Pink Triangle symbol used before The pink triangle was used by Nazis to show who was homosexual Homosexual people were sent to Concentration Camps in Nazi Germany They made homosexual men wear a pink triangle This was like the yellow Star of David that Jews had to wear to show who was Jewish LGBT people were not ashamed of the pink triangle But they wanted a symbol that was happier and more positive

In the LGBT version of the rainbow flag each color has a different meaning

It used to have a pink stripe which meant sexuality but was cut off because it was too expensive to get pink cloth

Rainbows are a symbol of gay union Tens of thousand of people use the rainbow symbol everyday

Dualism is the idea or theory that something is split into two parts These parts are separate from each other and the thing cannot be divided up in any other way The idea or theory that something cannot be split into any parts is called monism The idea that something can be split into many parts is called pluralism

In philosophy there are many kinds of dualism

Dualism is also a common sense idea For example it is a form of dualism to say that a thing is either hot or cold good or bad mine or somebody elses with no allowance for possible states in between

Vomiting also called puking is emptying the contents of stomach through mouth It can be either food or liquid in the stomach It can be from infection contaminated food or drink foul smells or foul tasting food the brain being injured a block in the small intestines so food and liquid cannot go through too much alcohol or other drugs Also people can make themselves vomit which is called purging Usually people who have eaten or drunk poison are made to vomit any residual poison off Excessive vomiting may lead to dehydration which can be dangerous if not fatal

Ancient Greece was a large area in the north west of the Mediterranean where people spoke Greek It was much bigger than the Greece we know today It was the civilization of Greece from the Archaic period of the 8th6th centuries BC to 146 BC The period ended with the Roman conquest of Greece in the Battle of Corinth

For most of this time the Greeks did not have a single government or ruler There were a number of city states each of which had its own constitution Athens Sparta and Corinth are examples Some had kings and some like Athens had a form of democracy 

In the middle of this period was Classical Greece which flourished during the 5th to 4th centuries BC Athenian leadership successfully repelled the threat of Persian invasion The Athenian Golden Age ends with the defeat of Athens at the hands of Sparta in the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC

In the last Helenistic period Greece was unified by the conquests of Alexander the Great The city states continued under the overall influence of Macedonia

Greek culture had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire which carried a version of it to many parts of the Mediterranean region and Europe In this way Classical Greece was part of the foundation of Western civilization Greek was also the language and partly the culture of the Byzantine Empire

Classical Antiquity in Greece is preceded by the Mycenaean culture and then by the Greek Dark Ages The history of Greece during this time may be split into the following periods 

In the 8th century BC the Greeks learned how to read and write a second time They had lost literacy at the end of the Mycenaean culture as the Mediterranean world fell into the Dark Ages The Greek Dark Ages or Bronze Age collapse is a period in the history of Ancient Greece and Anatolia from which there are no records and few archaeological remains

The Greeks learned about the alphabet from another ancient people the Phoenicians They made some adjustments to it In particular the Greeks introduced regular letters for vowels which was necessary for their language Their alphabet was in turn copied by the Romans and much of the world now uses the Roman alphabet

Ancient Greece had a single language and culture but was not was unified until 337 BC when Macedonia defeated Athens and Thebes That marked the end of the Ancient period and the start of the Hellenistic period Even then the conquered cities were merely joined to the Corinthian League they were not occupied but ruled themselves 

Ancient Greece consisted of several hundred more or less independent city states This was different from other societies which were tribal or kingdoms ruling over relatively large territories 

Undoubtedly the geography of Greecedivided and sub divided by hills mountains and riverscontributed to the nature of ancient Greece On the one hand the ancient Greeks had no doubt that they were one people they had the same religion same basic culture and same language Yet the city states were independent unification was something rarely discussed by the ancient Greeks 

Even when during the second Persian invasion of Greece a group of city states allied themselves to defend Greece the most poleis remained neutral and after the Persian defeat the allies quickly returned to infighting

Thus the major peculiarities of the Ancient Greek political system were firstly its fragmentary nature and secondly the focus on urban centres within otherwise tiny states There was not one country but many little countries called city states 

The colonies they set up throughout the Mediterranean though they counted a Greek polis as their mother were completely independent of the founding city

Conquest or direct rule by another city state appears to have been quite rare Instead the poleis grouped themselves into leagues membership of which was in a constant state of flux Later in the Classical period the leagues would become fewer and larger be dominated by one city 

Often cities would be compelled to join under threat of war Even after Philip II of Macedon conquered the heartlands of ancient Greece he did not attempt to annex the territory or unify it into a new province but simply compelled most of the poleis to join his own Corinthian League

In ancient times not all of Greece was democratic Democratic city states like Athens or semi democratic city states like Sparta were just a few examples of the states that together formed Greece The most famous Greek kingdom is Macedon which became the largest empire the world had seen at the time and conquered Egypt and Persia until it reached modern day India Other famous kingdoms are Epirus and Thessaly 

Monarchies in ancient Greece were not entirely absolute because there was a council of old people who gave advise to the King These people were not elected like they were in the Greek city states

The number of Greeks grew and soon they could not grow enough food for all the people When this happened a city would send people off to start a new city 

Because the terrain was rough most travel was by the sea For this reason many new cities were established along the coastline First new cities were started in Anatolia and then in the Black sea in Cyprus in southern Italy and in Sicily by the sea in what today is Libya They even started a city Naucratis on the river Nile in Egypt The cities of today Syracuse Naples Marseilles and Istanbul started as the Greek cities Syracusa Neapolis Massilia and Byzantium

By the 6th century some cities became much more important than the others They were Corinth Thebes Sparta and Athens

The Spartans were very good soldiers They defeated the people who lived near them and those people had to farm the land for the Spartans These people called helots had to give the Spartans part of the food they grew and so the Spartans did not have to work Instead they learned how to be better soldiers There were not many Spartans but there were many helots What if the helots rebel thought the Spartans They were afraid of that To stop the helots rebelling they sometimes did bad things to the helots The Spartans wanted the helots to be afraid of them so that the helots would not rebel and fight to be free The Spartans had two kings who led them in war They were also ruled by a group of old men called the Gerousia

Athens became a democracy in 510 BC The men came to a place in the center of the city and decided what to do It was the first place in the world where the people decided what their country should do They would talk and then vote on what to do at the Boule or the Bouleutirion But the women did not vote They did not have helots like Sparta but they had slaves These slaves were owned by their masters and could be sold to someone else The Athenian slaves were less free than the Spartan helots but the Athenians were not afraid of their slaves Every year they elected 8 generals who led them in war

In 499 BC the Greek cities in Anatolia rebelled They did not want Persia to rule them anymore Athens sent 20 ships to fight the Persians on the sea The Greeks in Anatolia were defeated The Persian King Darius decided to punish Athens He sent soldiers and ships to fight Athens 

Athens asked for help from Sparta Sparta wanted to help but could not they had a religious festival at that time Athens sent her soldiers against the Persian soldiers at the Battle of Marathon they defeated the Persians Then the help from Sparta came

Unfortunately for Leonidas after a couple of days a traitor called Ephialtes led the Persians around the pass behind the Greek army at Thermopylae Realising that defeat was inevitable Leonidas sent away most of the amassed troops

On the third day Leonidas led his 300 Spartan hoplites plus the allied Thespians and Thebans against Xerxes and his army of 100000 Immortals The Spartan led forces fought this unstoppable Persian force to their deaths in order to block the pass long enough to keep Xerxes and his army occupied while the rest of the Greek army escaped

After Thermopylae many Greeks wanted to go south to the Peloponnese Because of the sea the way into the Peloponnese is very narrow Many wanted to fight the Persians where it is very narrow by the city of Corinth 

Athens was north of Corinth and she had many ships Athens leader Themistocles wanted to fight the Persians by the island of Salamis Xerxes decided to send his fleet against the Greek fleet before the Greek ships could go to the Peloponnese The Greek fleet defeated the Persians at the Battle of Salamis Xerxes then went home with many of his soldiers but a Persian army stayed in Greece This army was defeated at the Battle of Platea in 479 BC

After the Persians were defeated at Platea the Spartans did very little However Persia sent its ships across the sea to help Greek cities in Anatolia fight for their freedom Athens asked the Greek cities on the islands in the Aegean and in Anatolia to join her These cities agreed because they were afraid of Persia These cities formed the Delian League and Athens was their leader Many of the cities had to pay Athens money Athens used the money to build many ships Sparta was still strong on land but Athens was stronger on the sea Several times there was war between Athens and Sparta Then Athens decided to send many ships to Sicily to fight against the city Syracuse Sparta sent help to Syracuse and Athens was defeated None of the Athenian ships came back Now Sparta decided to build ships to fight Athens It took a long time for Sparta to defeat Athens but then at the Battle of Aegospotami the Spartans destroyed most of Athenss ships The Athenians used a highly advanced type of ship known only as triremes These highly advanced battle craft were equipped with sophisticated combat systems and were propelled by an armada of extremely buff men On the front of the trireme was a large bronze ram The trireme would row itself at an enemy boat very fast and ram a hole into its hull This was the most effective way for the trireme to destroy other boats Sometimes the soldiers on the trireme would board the ship and keep it for their own

Men if not farming fighting or discussing politics could be at the Ancient Greek theatre watching dramas comedies or tragedies These often involved politics and gods Women were not allowed to perform at the theatre male actors played female roles

Women were doing domestic work like spinning and weaving They were not involved in public life or politics

Boys liked playing games like hockey They usually played games naked so girls were forbidden to watch They also played non physical activiy games like marbles dice checkers and knucklebones 

Malaria is an infectious disease It is caused by parasites People catch malaria when the parasite enters the blood The parasite causes a deadly infection which kills many people each year

The parasite that causes malaria is a protozoan called Plasmodium Protozoa are organisms with only one cell but they are not bacteria Bacteria are smaller and simpler than protozoa

There are several species of Plasmodium that cause malaria in humans

P vivax and P falciparum cause the most malaria in people Falciparum malaria is the worst kind and kills the most people

People usually get malaria from the Anopheles or Culex mosquitoes they are the vectors of the disease The Plasmodium gets into people by the bites of mosquitoes The Plasmodium is in the mosquitos special saliva The mosquitos saliva injects an anticoagulant into the person to prevent their blood from clotting The person is then infected with Plasmodium as a by product This makes the person have the disease we call malaria

The kind of mosquito that carries malaria is the anopheles mosquito Only the female mosquito gives people malaria because only the female mosquito bites

Some people do not get malaria from mosquitoes A baby can get it while inside its mother This is called maternal fetal transmission People can also get malaria from a blood transfusion This is when someone gives blood to another person Another way people can catch malaria is by using a needle that someone with the disease used before them

It was Britains Sir Ronald Ross working in the Presidency General Hospital in Calcutta who finally proved in 1898 that malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes He did this by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds For this work Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine After resigning from the Indian Medical Service Ross worked at the newly established Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and directed malaria control efforts in Egypt Panama Greece and Mauritius The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by Walter Reed in 1900 Its recommendations were used during construction of the Panama Canal This public health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public health campaigns against the disease

The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree which contains quinine This tree grows on the slopes of the Andes mainly in Peru The indigenous peoples of Peru made a tincture of cinchona to control malaria The Jesuits noted the efficacy of the practice and introduced the treatment to Europe during the 1640s where it was rapidly accepted It was not until 1820 that the active ingredient quinine was extracted from the bark isolated and named by French chemists

In the early 20th century before antibiotics became available Julius Wagner Jauregg discovered that patients with syphilis could be treated by intentionally infecting them with malaria The resulting fever would kill the syphilis spirochaetes and quinine could be administered to control the malaria Although some patients died from malaria this was preferable to the almost certain death from syphilis

Malaria was the largest hazard encountered by US troops in the South Pacific during World War II where about 500000 men were infected Sixty thousand American soldiers died of malaria during the North African and South Pacific campaigns

When Plasmodium enters the blood they are then called sporozoites Sporozoites go to the liver where they make many more sporozoites Then they change into a different form of Plasmodium This form is the merozoite The merozoites go into the red blood cells then they make many more merozoites

The merozoites break out of the red blood cells again and again When they do this the person gets very sick and shows symptoms of malaria This happens every few days and is called a paroxysm

P vivax and P ovale can live in the liver for a long time A person can look well but still have the Plasmodium in the liver This is called a dormant phase Weeks or months later the Plasmodium can leave the liver to the blood and the person will get sick again 

P falciparum is the most dangerous type of malaria It makes people sicker than those with other types of malaria because there are more of them in the blood Also with falciparum malaria the red blood cells are sticky This makes the red blood cells block blood vessels If blood vessels are blocked this can hurt what the blood vessel brings blood to and can hurt peoples organs

Pregnant women and children are hurt most by malaria When they get malaria they get sicker 

40 of people live in a place where there is malaria Malaria is in these places

Every year 300 to 700 million people get malaria It kills 1 million to 2 million people every year 90 of the people who die from malaria die in Africa Most of the people who die from malaria are children In Africa 20 of children under five die from malaria Even if children do not die many have brain damage

Most of these deaths could be stopped with medicine or with ways to stop mosquitoes UNICEF says the medicine that costs the most for malaria is only 240 to help one adult But many of the places malaria may be found are in poor countries These countries do not have enough money to stop the mosquitoes or to give people medicine

Symptoms are changes in someones body that are signs for a disease Most people who get malaria get symptoms 1030 days after they get infected But some people can get symptoms after only a week and some may be infected with malaria and not have symptoms for a year 

The most common symptom of malaria is fever when the body temperature is high The fever from malaria usually comes very suddenly The people who have Malaria often feel like they had influenza

Symptoms of malaria are

Complications are problems that happen because of a disease

Pregnant women and young children have more complications People who get malaria for the first time have more complications Falciparum malaria has the most complications 

Complications of malaria are

In places where malaria is there may not be good medical care People may diagnose malaria just by people having symptoms Diagnose means to learn if a person has a disease Doctors diagnose people sometimes just by symptoms This is called a clinical diagnosis Doctors also use tests to see if people have a disease

If a person has symptoms and is in a place where there is malaria they might have malaria To see if they have malaria doctors may do a blood test This test is called a Giemsa blood smear Blood is put on a slide which is a thin piece of glass The Giemsa stain is put on the slide This stain helps doctors see the malaria Then they look at the slide under a microscope The Plasmodium is seen in the red blood cells

Sometimes the blood smear will not show Plasmodium even if the person has malaria This can be because the stain was not good It can also be because the microscope was not good Or it can be because the person looking in the microscope did not know what Plasmodium look like But often it is because the number of malaria parasites present in the blood is so low that they are not present in the section of the blood that was looked at

There are other tests to diagnose malaria These are more expensive People do not use them as much Sometimes people test to see if the Plasmodium is resistant to medicines to treat malaria Resistance means the medicine cannot hurt the Plasmodium This means that taking the medicine will not cure someone with malaria because it will not kill the Plasmodium

People with different kinds of malaria need different medicines The medicine that works for one kind of malaria may not for another kind So it is very important to know which species of Plasmodium the person has 

If the species is not known the person should be given medicine and care like they have falciparum malaria  the worst kind

It is also important to know where the person got malaria Plasmodium in some places are resistant to some medicines So the medicines to treat malaria in Africa are different from the medicines to treat malaria from South America

It is important for doctors to learn about malaria treatment Resistance to medicines changes Places where there was no resistance can get resistant malaria So doctors need to know when this changes If a doctor treats a person with malaria he should know what places in the world have resistant malaria If he has not treated a person in a long time he should check before treating people

Everywhere except New Guinea the treatment is the same In New Guinea most P vivax is resistant to chloroquine It can be treated with quinine but this medicine can make people sick Everywhere else non falciparum malaria is treated with chloroquine

Chloroquine kills the Plasmodium in the blood But the Plasmodium in the liver is not killed by chloroquine P vivax and P ovale both stay in the liver a long time This is the dormant phase Another medicine must be given with chloroquine for P vivax and P ovale This is to kill the Plasmodium in the liver If this other medicine is not given malaria can come back after months It can even come back five years later

The medicine used to kill malaria in the liver is primaquine In southeast Asia some P vivax is resistant to primaquine Most other places primaquine works very well

Some people get very sick from primaquine Some people do not make enough of an enzyme in the blood This enzyme is called Glucose 6 Phosphate Dehydrogenase People who do not have enough have a disease called G6PD deficiency People with G6PD deficiency get very very sick if they take primaquine It makes their red blood cells all die This can even kill them So people have to be tested to see if they have G6PD deficiency before they take primaquine

Medicines to kill P vivax and P ovale in the liver are not safe for pregnant women So a pregnant woman must usually take chloroquine until she has her baby

Falciparum is the worst kind of malaria Most people who die from malaria have falciparum

Many people with falciparum malaria must be treated in a hospital People with falciparum malaria should be treated in a hospital if they are

Even people who are treated with medicines at home should stay with the doctor for 8 hours This is to make sure they do not get sicker It also makes sure they can take the medicines by mouth

Falciparum malaria also has more resistance to medicines This makes it much harder to treat Falciparum malaria is always treated with two or more medicines Doctors choose the medicines by where in the world the person got malaria Different places have P falciparum that is resistant to different medicines

The most important resistance is chloroquine resistance In some places in the world P falciparum is killed by chloroquine In some places it is chloroquine resistant This means chloroquine does not kill it In these places quinine can be used 

If people are very sick and cannot swallow medicines they get intravenous

 The IV medicine used for very bad chloroquine resistant falciparum malaria is quinine If people got malaria i

n a place with no chloroquine resistance other medicines can be used But sometimes doctors

If 

the P falciparum is not chloroquine resistant people do not usually take quinine This is because quinine can make people sick If people get sick from quinine it is called Cinchonism Symptoms of cinchonism are

Quinine is also taken by mouth

The best way to treat malaria is to not get it

There are three ways to prevent malaria

Vector control is one way to stop malaria Vector means an organism that carries an infectious disease to another organism For malaria the vector is the anopheles mosquito It carries Plasmodium to people 

There are many ways to conduct a good vector control The best ways are different in different places This depends on the environment It also depends on how much malaria is in the place So the best way to do vector control in the United States is different than the best way to do vector control in South Africa

The most used method of vector control is pesticides These are chemicals that kill the mosquito The first pesticide used for vector control was DDT DDT was first used in World War II

DDT worked very well for vector control It killed mosquitoes It did not make people very sick at the time it was used It did not cost very much money Other chemicals for vector control had not been invented yet

In many places mosquitos became resistant to DDT This meant that DDT did not work anymore in these areas The places where mosquitoes are DDT resistant are

The EPA classifies DDT as a Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxinmeaning that it builds up over time in the bodies of plantsanimals and humansDDT can be passed on from water to fish or some plants and consequently passed from plantfish on to humans who may eat them

Possible Harmful Effects include

Scientists also worried that DDT was making people and animals sick Scientists think it might cause hormones to not work right It might also make people and animals have trouble reproducing It killed a lot of wildlife too

They learned that DDT stays in the environment for a long time They learned also that DDT used in one place may go all over the world DDT used in Africa may go to Europe So people are worried that DDT used today will stay in the world for a long time This is why DDT is not allowed to be used in farming anymore

For these reasons people mostly use other chemicals for vector control Organophosphate or carbamate pesticides are used like malathion or bendiocarb These cost more money than DDT And there are ways to control malaria that do not use chemicals at all 

Vector control is not the only way to stop malaria And DDT is not the only chemical that can be used for vector control The best way to stop malaria is to use a combination of methods In some places DDT may be a useful part of a program to stop malaria This is why DDT is still allowed to be used for controlling malaria

The mosquito that carries malaria comes more at dawn and dusk Be most careful at these times

Wear long pants and shirts with long sleeves

Wear mosquitoes repellent Mosquitoes will bite through thin cloth So repellent should be used on skin and clothes

Pesticides can be used in rooms to kill mosquitoes

When sleeping outside people use a mosquito net This is made from cloth that air can go through but keeps mosquitoes out It is put over a bed where people sleep to keep mosquitoes out Sometimes people also use it when they are not sleeping It is best to use mosquito nets that have been treated with Permethrin which repels and kills mosquitoes

People can take medicine when they are in a place where there is malaria This reduces the chances that they contract malaria This is called prophylaxis

Some people take prophylactic medicines for years Many people in areas where there is malaria do not have the money to buy this medicine

People who live where there is no malaria usually have not had malaria The first case malaria is usually much worse So people from places where there is no malaria may take prophylactic medicines when they go to places where there is malaria

The kind of prophylactic medicines people take depends on where they are This is because not all medicines work on the malaria in every place Some Plasmodium are resistant Even if the right medicine is used it does not always work Sometimes people get malaria even if they take prophylaxis Sometimes this is because people do not take the medicine the right way But even if it is taken right it does not always work

To make them work best prophylactic medicines have to be taken the right way The medicine should start before going to an area with malaria Most medicines should be taken for 4 weeks after coming home One medicine only needs to be used for one week after coming home

A blood vessel is a tube that carries blood Blood vessels that take blood away from the heart are arteries Blood vessels that take blood to the heart are veins Capillaries are located between veins and arteries and they supply tissue with blood and oxygen

The heart plus all of the blood vessels in the body together are called the circulatory system

The expansion of blood vessels is called vasodilation it helps the body to get rid of heat energy The constrication of blood vessels is called vasoconstriction it prevents the body from losing warmth

They are what stops you dying

Jana Gana Mana written in Sanskritised Bengali is the first of five stanzas of a Brahmo hymn composed and scored by Nobel Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore

It was first sung at the Calcutta Session of the Indian National Congresson 27 December 1911 Jana Gana Mana was officially adopted by the Constituent Assembly as the Indian national anthem on January 24 1950 Every independence day the billion people of the republic of India join together in singing this beautifully composed anthem with its amazing music Its amazingly poetic verses make it one of best anthems in the world The Bengali lyrics are transliterated below

 Thou art the ruler of the minds of all people Dispenser of Indias destiny Thy name rouses the hearts of Punjab Sindh Gujarat and Maratha Of the Dravida and Orissa and Bengal It echoes in the hills of the Vindhyas and Himalayas mingles in the music of Jamuna and Ganges and is chanted by the waves of the Indian Sea They pray for thy blessings and sing thy praise The saving of all people waits in thy hand Thou dispenser of Indias destiny

The circulatory system is the body system that brings blood to the body The heart and all blood vessels make up the circulatory system

Blood vessels that take blood away from the heart are arteries Arteries get smaller as they go away from the heart When arteries get very small they are called arterioles

Blood vessels that take blood towards the heart are veins Veins get bigger as they go toward the heart The smallest veins are called venules

Capillaries go between arteries and veins

So blood moves heart artery arteriole capillary venule vein heart This is called circulation There are two different circulations in the circulatory system The systemic circulation is how blood goes to most of the body The pulmonary circulation is how blood goes through the lungs

Blood that comes from the left side of the heart is full of oxygen and nutrients Nutrients are substances that your body needs to live like protein fat carbohydrates vitamins and minerals This blood brings the oxygen and nutrients to your body

This blood in systemic arteries that is full of oxygen and nutrients is systemic arterial blood It is sometimes just called arterial blood 

The biggest systemic artery in the body is the aorta This is the large blood vessel that comes out of the heart Smaller arteries branch off from the aorta These arteries have smaller arteries that branch off from them The smallest arteries turn into arterioles

The smallest blood vessels are capillaries Systemic arterioles turn into capillaries The blood from arterioles goes into the capillaries There oxygen and nutrients go out of the blood into the tissue around the capillaries The blood also picks up carbon dioxide and waste from the tissue The network of capillaries that brings blood to an area is called a capillary bed

On the other end of the capillary it turns into a venule Venules are the smallest veins Veins take blood back to the heart As veins go back to the heart they get bigger The biggest systemic veins in the body are the vena cava There are two vena cava The inferior vena cava takes blood from the lower part of the body to the right side of the heart The superior vena cava takes blood from the upper part of the body to the heart

This same movement of blood happens in the pulmonary circulation

The blood that the vena cavae takes to the heart is full of carbon dioxide It has much less oxygen than arterial blood The right side of the heart pushes the venous blood into the pulmonary artery The pulmonary artery takes blood to the lungs In the lungs the blood goes through the pulmonary capillary bed Here it gets more oxygen It also drops off carbon dioxide

After the pulmonary capillary bed the blood goes to the pulmonary veins This pulmonary venous blood now is full of oxygen The pulmonary veins take blood to the left side of the heart Then the blood goes to the systemic circulation again

The pink triangle is one of the two big symbols of the LGBT community The other is the rainbow flag The pink triangle was first used in Nazi Germany to mark homosexual prisoners There was also a black triangle that marked anti social women Many but not all of these women were lesbians Jews wore the famous yellow star of David If a prisoner was both Jewish and gay he would wear a yellow triangle overlapped by a pink triangle creating a star of David

Homosexuality was illegal in Nazi Germany under a law called Paragraph 175 which made it a felony About 100000 people were arrested with about 50000 sent to prison Some were sent to mental hospitals Some were castrated Some homosexual men were also sent to concentration camps especially Jewish homosexuals Between 15000 and 600000 homosexual men were sent to concentration camps Most of them died there We are not sure of the real number Prisoners who were Jewish and homosexual may not have been counted as homosexual

Homosexual prisoners were treated worse than other prisoners Their death rates were higher than other anti social groups One story by a gay man who lived in a concentration camp shows how it was Pierre Seel was sent to the Schirmeck concentration camp The Nazis said a public execution would happen A man was brought out Seel saw that the man was his 18 year old lover The Nazis took all the clothes of Seels lover and put a bucket over his head Then Seel had to watch as the Nazis let German Shepherds maul his lover to death

After World War II homosexual men were still not treated well in Germany The law continued It was used to hurt homosexuals and to put them in prison Many spent years in prison

The pink triangle observes the memory of the homosexual people who died in the Holocaust It is important not to ignore these deaths The killing of homosexuals and that this still happened after WWII is the secret story of the Holocaust Using the pink triangle symbol puts these victims in the public view It is in respect for those who died

A chat room is a virtual place on the Internet where people can get together and talk using text People use programs like IRC to join a chat room and type messages or send pictures to other people There are also other programs called instant messengers to stay in contact with friends and other people Websites on the Internet often have types of chat rooms built into them and lots of chat rooms also use webcams

Chat rooms are normally used as tools to talk with people that are far away but many people still use them to talk to people who live near them because its very convenient

Alan Wake is a video game made by Remedy Entertainment It is a thriller game and was voted best game of E3 in 2005 It was released on Xbox 360 in May 2010 A planned PC version was canceled

One big difference in this game is that Dante is no longer the main character A new character named Nero is the new hero Lady and Trish from older games return in this game This game has more new characters such as Kyrie Credo Agnus Gloria and Sanctus and new demons and bosses for the player to fight

This game is just like the first games It follows the usual Devil May Cry gameplay using a variety of melee and long range weapons

50 Cent burst onto the rap music scene in 2002 with the help of his fellow gang boss Rijaan DM Since then he has sold millions of records His debut album Get Rich Or Die Tryin broke music records and went multi platinum In the summer of 2005 50 Cent had a fight with The Game a rapper in his G Unit group After this The Game left G Unit and made some diss songs about 50 Cent 50 Cent answered with songs like Mr Potato Head and 300 shots featuring G Unit 50 Cent was also the first to sign onto a joint effort between Eminems Shady Records and Dr Dres Aftermath Entertainment 50 Cent also mentions Rijaan DM in many of his tracks eg the famous Candy Shop Down On Me FT Jeremih etc As a teen 50 Cents role model was Tupac Shakur so from the start his ambition was to be a gangster rapper

Subjects are the parts into which learning can be divided At school each lesson usually covers one subject only

National curriculum 

Primary school subjects Ages 4 11

Secondary school subjects Ages 11 16

The most common subjects at school are

Other subjects include 

Learning English is what people do when they want to learn how to speak and listen to the English language People who want to learn English usually also learn to read and write at the same time

A lot of people learn English at school where English is a common subject

A lot of people also want to spend their own personal time to learn English They might know no English when they start or they might have learned some English at school

There are two ways to learn English outside of school

Many people join lessons like school lessons but at learning centres where any people can go no matter their age In such a centre they will join a class fitting their existing level of learning of English so that they will be in a group for the teacher to help them learn

An example of this type of learning is at the classes by the British Council Here is their website

Other people try to learn English on their own or in a less formal setting than in a group of people with a teacher

People might meet with others who are trying to learn English in order to practice their standard of English when speaking

People can also listen to radio broadcasts in English or watch television programmes in English to help them improve their listening ability A popular channel to listen to the radio on is broadcast by the BBC called the BBC World Service  

People can also study English by reading books or listening to English courses on recorded CDs or cassettes

A popular way to learn English in the modern world is to make use of the internet where there are many websites that can help learners The BBC World Service has a free website for people who are learning English as a second or foreign language called BBC Learning English There are many online community forums such as Englishforums where many people meet to learn English Questions are answered quickly even with help from volunteer teachers from all over the whole world

An ethical tradition is a group of things that one group of people think are right and wrong People believe that these things are right and wrong because other people think that way and they have thought that way for a long time

An ethical tradition can be like a set of laws because most people agree with it and only do what it says is right However an ethical tradition is not normally written down and is not enforced by a police force

The branch of philosophy called ethics is not the same as an ethical tradition This is because ethics is about asking questions and not just thinking what other people think However some ethical philosophers want to know why people follow ethical traditions They also want to know what ethical traditions are the same for different groups of people This type of ethics is sometimes called the science of morals

A Dildo is a sex toy which is used in place of an actual penis for sexual reasons Both men and women can use dildos most often for putting into the vagina or anus but also sometimes instead of oral sex etc Since dildos are very simple toys they can be and are used in many different ways They are capable of producing arousal to the point of an orgasm and for this reason dildos are commonly used for masturbation Dildos are also used during sex with more than one person though

Dildos come in many different shapes sizes and materials for different looks and feels different uses and to provide the best stimulation for different people Some dildos vibrate and pivot for extra pleasure they are called vibrators

Bioinformatics is the study of large amounts of biological information Mostly it focuses on molecules like DNA It is done mostly with the help of computers

As species of living things change over time the DNA contained in their cells change from evolution If we can extract the information from living things today and compare them to each other we can see which living things are most closely related much like comparing two editions of a book the most similar can be thought to be the most closely related in time Doing this biologists can construct family trees or phylogenies By stitching together all the trees a grand tree connecting all living things can be made this is called the Tree of Life Bioinformatics is intergration of mathematical statistical and computational method to analyze biological biochemical and biophysical data

Anything a cell could possibly want is stored in its DNA When a cell wants to build a protein it finds the appropriate piece of DNA makes a copy of it and uses the instructions in the copy to make the protein 

Proteins are the machinery of a cell They can perform many functions like transportation structural support movement and metabolism Proteins are made from amino acids There are twenty different amino acids that are used to build millions of different protein molecules 

The principle of bioinformatics is that these molecules can be studied by using computers to analyze the DNA RNA and amino acid sequences from which they are created Because there are so many different molecules the best way we have of understanding how the entire system works is to use bioinformatics

Chemists have developed ways to understand the shape and behavior of small molecules using mathematical analysis They might use computers to study these molecules Also the DNA contained in just one cell of an organism is far too large to be read by any person and to compare the DNA between two organisms be they in the brother and sister or of a completely different species requires comparing large amounts of information for small differences Computers are far better suited to such comparisons and computer programmers have worked with biologists to create very very large databases to store all the DNA information that has ever been learned Biochemists today are trying to answer these questions about every single cell in the body

The economy of India is the 11th largest in the world with a GDP of 568 billion If you consider PPP the economy is fourth largest The growth rate is 89 in Quarter 2 of 2010 However that is still only 3100 per person per year

Indias economy includes agriculture handicrafts industries and a lot of services Services are the main source of economic growth in India today though two thirds of Indian people earn their living directly or indirectly through agriculture In recent times due to its large number of well educated people who can speak English India sells a lot of computer programs to other countries

For most of Indias independent history it had strict government controls in many areas such as telecommunications banking and foreign direct investment Since the early 1990s India has slowly opened up its markets by reducing government control on foreign trade and investment

The social and economic problems India faces are the increasing population poverty lack of infrastructure and growing unemployment Although poverty has gone down 10 since the 1980s a quarter of Indias citizens still cannot pay for enough food

Testicles are parts that are found on the bodies of male creatures Male mammals including men have two testicles supported in a sac of skin below the penis called the scrotum Along with the penis testicles are called reproductory organs or sex organs Only males have testicles females have ovaries

Testicles are a type of organ called glands Like other glands testicles make chemical substances called hormones that keep the body working Testicles also make sperm which can join with ova to make new life 

Most glands like womens ovaries are inside the body but testicles are outside the main part of the body This is because the testicles work better if they are cooler than the inside of the body In cold weather testicles pull up nearer to the body to keep warm 

The testicles are firm oval shaped glands Most testicles match in size but some testicles are much larger or smaller than others Normal sized testicles are between 14 cm to 35 cm 

Nearly all men have one testicle that hangs lower than the other one Scientists think this may be so that they do not hit against each other It can be either the left or the right that hangs lower but in 85 of men it is the right one The right testicle usually descends first and this may affect which one hangs lower 

The testicles hang in the scrotum by the spermatic cord They are outside the body because they need to be cooler than the temperature inside the body in order to make sperm If a mans testicles get cold they are automatically pulled closer to the body The spermatic cord is tightened by the cremasteric muscle When this muscle contracts the cord gets shorter which pulls the testicles closer to the body If the testicles are too warm the cremasteric muscle relaxes This lowers the testicles to keep them cooler This is how the testicles are kept at the right temperature This is called the cremasteric reflex

There are other uses for the cremasteric reflex apart from making the testicles the right temperature Stress can also make the cremasteric reflex work If a male human or mammal gets into a fight then its testicles are in danger They automatically pull up close to the body The cremasteric reflex also happens during sexual intercourse

Testicles have two important jobs in the body They are part of two of the bodys systems the endocrine system which keeps the body working and the reproductive system which makes new life 

Testicles are a type of organ called glands The human body has many types of glands The job of glands within a body is to make chemical substances and put them out into the bodys system A body has lots of different systems that keep it in good working order all the time and that also provide for a bodys special needs Some of the bodys special needs happen when a person gets angry frightened or sick or if the person wants to have sexual intercourse At these times a body uses more of some types of chemical substance so the glands that make them work harder 

Testicles make several types of chemical substances They are not simple chemicals but are very complicated and very important to life Making these substances is controlled by the pituitary gland which is a small gland in the brain

One substance made by the testicles is a type of substance known as a hormone It is the hormone testosterone Testosterone is important in a male persons body because it makes him grow into a man and feel like a man during puberty 

As well as being chemical producing glands testicles are gonads Apart from hormones the other important substances made by the testicles are spermatozoa which are generally just called sperm The sperm are tiny living cells which can join with another cell called an ovum inside a female to start a new human life Scientists call making sperm spermatogenesis Boys begin making sperm when they start growing into men at a time of life called puberty 

Women do not have testicles The glands in their bodies that do the same sort of jobs as testicles are called ovaries Women have two ovaries but unlike testicles ovaries are inside the body on either side of the uterus They release ova and female hormones Ovaries and testicles are sometimes called gonads 

Size in animals

Studying animals can help in understanding things about people In mammals testicles can be very big or very small in relation to the size of the animal itself The size has to do with the amount of sperm that the male animal needs to make Some types of male animal generally only have one sexual partner at a time and are called monogamous Some types of animals generally live in a herd or flock where one male will have many female sexual partners These males are called polygamous More sperm is needed by polygamous males than by monogamous males Polygamous males generally have larger testicles than monogamous males The testicles grow larger to make more sperm

Size in men

Most mens testicles are from 14 cm to 35 cm This is a measure of volume Sometimes Doctors need to measure a mans testicles to see if there is a problem Doctors can measure the volume of testicles in two ways 

Sometimes the size of a mans testicles changes

Some reasons why testicles get smaller are 

Some reasons why testicles get bigger are 

The most important diseases of testicles are

Loss and injury 

Most boys are born with two testicles in the scrotum The testicles have formed inside the babys body but moved into the scrotum before the birth Sometimes one or both the testicles are still inside when the baby is born Sometimes an operation is needed to fix this 

If a testicle is injured it is extremely painful Sometimes testicles get crushed Sometimes it is necessary for a doctor to remove one or both the testicles This operation is called an orchidectomy If a man loses a testicle a doctor can put a testicular prosthesis into the scrotum It looks and feels like a testicle 

If a male loses both his testicles it called castration Because the man cannot produce sperm or testosterone it has a big effect on the mans life Because he cannot make sperm he cannot have children And because he cannot make the male hormone testosterone he becomes less like a male He may lose some of his muscles and put on weight A man who has lost his testicles may take testosterone medicine so that he does not have these changes 

Until the 1700s in Europe and more recently in some countries there was a custom to castrate young male slaves and boys Young slaves were castrated so that they could be used as guards over the wives of rich men It meant that the wives would not fall in love with their guards Sometimes young boys who had beautiful singing voices were castrated before puberty This meant that their voices would stay high all their lives These singing men were called castrati 

Castrating animals 

It is very common to castrate male domestic animals Male dogs and cats that are castrated do not fight so much and do not stray around looking for females to mate with 

Male horses are usually castrated so that they become more calm and safer to ride A castrated male horse is called a gelding A male horse that is not castrated is a stallion 

Male animals that are used for meat are generally castrated because it makes them fatter and also makes them quieter to keep because they do not fight each other Most male cattle are castrated

Testicles can also be called testes or gonads

There are many slang words for testicles like balls nuts bollocks nads crown jewels etc Slang words are other names that are used for fun or to be vulgar

The Screwtape Letters is a book written by author and Christian scholar C S Lewis It appeared in installments in The Guardian newspaper and was later published as a book in 1942 It is a series of letters written by a devil named Screwtape to his apprentice and nephew Wormwood The letters are filled with advice for the young demon on how to tempt men Screwtape tells Wormwood how to undo the work of God and work against Him

The Screwtape Letters were greatly popular It was published in 1941 and after that it has sold very well around the world Because it is funny and easy to read and understand many people read it easily and have been influenced by it

The two main characters that are inside the letters are Wormwood a demon that has the job of leading his patient away from Christianity Screwtape is Wormwoods uncle and a high demon

Screwtape a devil and the uncle of Wormwood helps Satan and everything he stands for He calls the devil our Father He also fights against everything God stands for calling God The Enemy Wrong to him is right and right to him is wrong

Ironically even though many of the things he says are Biblically wrong some of the things he says are according to the Bible true He talks about the glory of heaven when the patient is taken up there though he does not understand why God gives them to men He admits to Wormwood that he does not know about his Enemy well enough Screwtape cannot understand love and says in Letter 18 that he believes that God must have another hidden reason to save men since everybody is selfish and cannot love

Screwtape is always afraid that God will step in and stop Wormwoods temptations Screwtape says that when the patient prays to God for help God always comes so Screwtape is fearful

At first Screwtape thinks the patients soul will go to hell However he is angry when Wormwood makes more and more mistakes He feels that God is winning the battle

Should there be a rule as to how many words a sentence in an article which is not a quote should have I see that many articles already approach typical Wikipedia prose with paragraph long sentences Perhaps a limit of 20 25 words per sentence would be usefulEloquence 1106 19 Dec 2003

I have changed difficult words into several words which say the same Many difficult words are links When should we simplify words which are links 

The pipe trick may help or maybe it does not Should we try to have many difficult words remain in the article as links to articles which explain them

Or would it be better to have them at the end of the article I do not mean that we would have them as a list of links The idea I got was that maybe we should have the words which might be links as a list of short explanations I will show what I mean below

I mean explanations like that Then we could have simple words in the article The more difficult words that have to do with the matter of the article would still be with it  C I M O N 1221 19 Dec 2003

Most of the articles I have come across on this Wiki seem to really belong in Wiktionary People seem to think that simple means give a dictionary definition because simple readers wont be able to understand anything more complex Can I just copy and paste articles such as Numeral or River into the Wiktionary Why may they not be appropriate for Wiktionary Are they appropriate here Skyfaller 1747 25 Jan 2004

Have you ever thought of making this a Wikipedia for Kids There are many versions of Wikipedia right now so it may seems that everyone would contribute to their language version Im just wondering cuz it seems that an article like enSedna doesnt seem to be good for a K 6 kid but the Simple English version would be great for them Thoughts 

Btw previews are appearings on the bottom instead of the the top of the page

I copied and edited a page at enwikipedia to Platypus I thought a standard message for such copied might be useful It can be added by typing msgen at the end of the article It looks like this

What do other people think about this Kevin Saff 2246 6 Apr 2004

Im not sure I dont like having tags on too many articles and this could apply to nearly all our articles here I tend to acknowledge it in the edit summary when I create the page Personally I think thats enough especially as we have a link to the English version in the interlanguage links section anyway Angela 0229 7 Apr 2004

The way I see it english and simple english are not really separate languages Therefore Id expect articles for the two to be tightly coupled An example where this is currently not the case is movement There are no interlanguage links to enmovement and back Would it be possible to automatically link simplemovement to enmovement and back Rainer

Hello Thank you for the good idea of making a Wikipedia in simple English I am currently working on a new Wikipedia the Tok Pisin wikipedia In order to facilitate the work of users to come I am using bilingual frames with English next to Tok Pisin Whenever there is an article in simple English I use it rather than the article in English 

But for the article on Buddha there is no simple English article yet and the English article is far too complicated Could you make it more simple and more explanatory about Buddhism 

httptpiwikipediaorgwikiBuda 

Thank you all in advance 

Milaiklainim

Hello all thanks for the article on Buddhism and on Buddha I will use them in the Tok Pisin Wikipedia I hope the Simple will grow one reason is that it could well help less favored languages to find a basis for their Wikipedias 

For the moment I would like an article on Nelson Mandela Count on you guys Best  Milaiklainim 0936 14 Apr 2004

From the User talkKevin Saff page

As for the Simple Wikipedia here is my commentmaybe a bit too long I was thinking the other day about the Simple articles that maybe they could have two or three levels One very simple dictionary like definition one slightly more extended list of relevant points and then details All could be on the same page or on different pages Well those are only my comments as a non native speaker of English Anyway thanks again I hope for more cooperation between the Simple and the TP Wikipedias  160232213 0258 9 Apr 2004

I think that is a good idea just there might be trouble regulating it However it might limit the direct copying from English Any further comment SimonMayer 2003 9 Apr 2004

Hello all I am the non English native user who suggested to have three levels of simplicitycomplexity It seems that you like the idea My suggestion now is to work on a sample article or example article to try it and refine it until we have a better idea how it could work I would be glad to participate  Milaiklainim 0103 15 Apr 2004 

SimonMayer 0128 15 Apr 2004

Is there a proper simplicity policy at the moment

Where do simple and complex meet SimonMayer 1339 12 Apr 2004

Its just we need to do something about complex articles that are just copied from en also there are ones that have just been written in complex English straight on here

Some of these articles can be simplified quite easily but there are others that are too long or far above our understanding Do we then delete the article Or do we do something else like placing a MediaWiki notice

For example

If we go down that route should we also have a WikipediaNeeds simplifying page

SimonMayer 1339 12 Apr 2004

I personally think we need to use an established standard for simple English such as Ogdens Basic English Saying simple without specifying HOW simple is like saying in a recipe Beat the mixture until its ready without saying how one can tell when the eggs are ready  Node

Very true and that has been discussed a lot There are problems with precise definitions though Mainly the inconvienience stopping people contributing Also some subjects cannot be described using only Basic English so less simple language has to be used  a tiered system has been discussed and seems popular but involves writing more articles so takes longer  Tango 1532 17 Apr 2004

We dont seem to have an agreement on a restricted vocabulary There appears to be a consensus that Basic English by itself is too limited Also the approximately 80000 words understood by a native English adult speaker is too many A great many of them overlap each other as unnecessary synonyms I propose we use the Simple Wiktionary to attempt to come to a general agreement on the vocabulary I suggest that the definitions use Basic English and pictures as much as possible When there is agreement that a word is too complex its listing should state this and propose an alternate word or phrase to use as a substitution Any comments Brian Merz 25 Jan 05

This is my first time on this wiki I have read the Useful pages and how to edit I also read the earlier questions here But Im still confused about how long or complex articles should be For example the Dog article in En wiki is very long the Dog article here is very short Is that on purpose Or is it simply that no one has expanded the one here It might help transplanted wikipedians like me to have a Good Example of one or two En articles that you think are well done here Elf 1918 16 Jun 2004

How about a system like that at English WPArticle of the week where a topic is nominated to be a focus for the week The only problem is that there doesnt seem to be enough editors working here often enough I think there could be a real push to get English editors to work on Simple Maybe a campaign to get people who create a new article at the main WP to also create a matching Simple article here Even if they dont become regulars here they will have added at least one page Considering that anyone at the main English WP has the potential to be able to write at the Simple WP there could be a strong collaboration set up between the two Instead of Simple being seen as just another language I dont understand Prehaps simply getting a prominent list of needed Simple articles at the main WP could kick start the effort I need to think through some ideas more closely first but I wanted to see if anyone else has similar proposals TPK 0629 5 Jul 2004

I think the attempt to create a simple english version of wikipedia is excellent Maybe using short sentences is valuable for someone who does not speak english well Obviously it is very difficult for someone who speaks english natively to create text which is easily understood by someone who doesnt However I think there is one important aspect of language simplicity which has not been mentioned  and that is the use of idioms If text is created without using very many idioms it will be much easier for readers to look up words in a dictionary and understand the english text

Hello I m catalan speaker i just discovered this simple wikipedia I had seen it many times before as links but i couldnt understand its purpose until i got here A wikipedia for non native english speakers is a great idea But i think I another one as many people use this wiki to learn why not have a correction section Non native will be able to collaborate and then good speakers will correct artcicles This would have three benefits 1 it will make simple wikipedia grow 2 it will animate contributors from many parts of the world so artciles would not be as englishcentric as they are now it would be the wikipedia of the world in the most spoken language of the world 3 it will help people to learn

Are you trying to make a Newspeak encyclopedia

Regarding the use of Disambiguation pages and listings in articles Ive found that alot of people are putting links to confused terms in the See Also sections rather than the standard Wikipedia style of at the top in italics which I think most find alot easier to use as you can see right away if you are on the wrong page Also is there a word or phrase being used instead of Disambiguation As its hardly simple  Nidonocu 0448 1 May 2005

I was noticing in the entry for temperature that the number systems were defined but that the simplest usages of those numbers werent mentioned 

Something as simple as we use smaller numbers for temperatures that are colder and larger numbers for hotter temperatures When the temperature is really cold we might use a negative number When it is getting colder outside we say the temperature is going down We might say the temperature will be high tomorrow if it is going to be hot

Actually this is more of a general question in regards to the structure and purpose of this wiki Is this wiki simply going to consist of the same organizational structure as the English one but with parallel articles that are simplier in language Or is this going to form its own structure in terms of templates categories articles etc If the latter we need to stop creating massive page dumps like 2004 One of the problems with these kinds of pages is that it forces this wiki into a structure exactly like the English one  Ricky81682 0834 29 May 2005

Because this Wikipedia is so useful for English learners we all need to make sure we follow standard English to set a good model  There are two classes of error that seem to recur by my observation

Im sure there are others I havent noticed so feel free to edit and add to this list  Granted both of these show up commonly in informal written English by native speakers  I actually believe that the use of its will become standard in a couple more decades because so few people observe the present standard  But AFAICT as a refence work an encyclopedia should use present day standard written English not advocate its change  Comments

Since the Main Page doesnt actually incorporate any images it may be helpful to modify this websites stylesheet to prevent vandals from adding inappropriate images to that page as Roberto recently did for example This can be done simply by hiding all images on the Main Page The following steps require the use of administrative rights

Obviously this method isnt foolproof those using Netscape Communicator or any skin other than MonoBook as well as users with CSS disabled arent protected and no one is protected against inappropriate ASCII art We use a weaker variation on this at the Vietnamese Wikipedia where the main page does include several images Its always possible to obfuscate the image hiding code so that vandals have a hard time figuring out why their special contributions dont show up

I just came across another place where I had a big urge to make a word a link but not to an obvious definition or related word but instead to a usage definition

If someone has been reading English a lot they are familiar with a writer showing an abbreviation or acronym next to a long full name and then using only that short word later in the article But if someone is not familiar with this they will wonder what that thing is So I wanted to do this

I linked the word to a definition of how it was being used The hope is that a confused person will see the definition of acronym return to the article look at IDDM and discover that it really is an acronym of the four words before that Of course when they have seen this done once they will know to look for this same acronym thing again But we are trying to help English learners and that must include some stylistic or usage examples

A pedophile is an adult or adolescent who is 16 years of age or older who is sexually attracted to children who have not reached puberty generally those below 14 Some argue that a pedophile has a mental disorder called pedophilia Some people with pedophilia have sex with children or use children in a sexual way This is called child sexual abuse Most but not all children who are sexually abused are abused by people who have pedophilia Some adults have pedophile feelings but do not act by sexually abusing children 

Medical researchers do not know how many people in the population are pedophiles This is because it is hard to study peoples feelings and desires unless they actually show that they have those feelings A second reason is that when an adult or teenager sexually abuses a child people often call the abuser a pedophile but it is possible that the abuse happened for a different reason A person is only a pedophile if they are sexually attracted to children If a person sexually abuses a child to frighten or punish them for example then it may not be true pedophile behaviour However most child sexual abuse is committed by pedophiles 

Not all pedophiles feel or act in the same way Since the 1880s psychologists have studied and shown that different pedophiles might act in different ways Here are some of the ways

Some studies have shown that those pedophiles who are attracted only to children if they act on their feelings and abuse a child often abuse many more victims than those pedophiles who also have sex with adults 

The people who abuse children or teenagers are often known to them and are not strangers Around half the adults who commit child sexual abuse against strangers also abuse their own children 

As of 2008 most doctors believe that pedophilia cannot be cured The current approach to deal with pedophiles tries to change the behaviour of the pedophile It does not change their sexual attraction Using this treatment some sex offenders can be prevented from offending again

Igneous rock is one of the three main rock types the others being sedimentary and metamorphic rock 

Igneous rocks are rocks formed from molten magma The material is made liquid by the heat inside the Earths mantle

When magma reaches the surface of the Earth it cools down to form a rock Common examples are lava tuff and basalt Also the rock may slowly cool down under the surface An example is granite

The upper 16 km of the Earths crust is composed of about 95 igneous rocks with only a thin widespread covering of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks

Igneous rocks are geologically important because

Magma is a complex high temperature fluid substance Temperatures of most magmas are in the range 700 C to 1300 C Magma can get forced into adjacent rocks or forced out to the surface as lava or blown out in exposions which include rock pieces

Magma is made up of atoms and molecules of melted minerals When magma cools the atoms and molecules rearrange to form mineral grains Rock forms when mineral grains grow together Granite diorite gabbro and basalt are a few types of igneous rock Quartz is one of the chief minerals produced by igneous action it is made of silica the most common molecule in igneous minerals Some examples of igneous volcanic rock are pumice obsidian and scoria and much more 

Most of the minerals that make up igneous rock are of these typesp12

The first six are silicates Oxides are mostly of iron

Bauxite is the main ore of aluminium It is mostly aluminium oxide

Bauxite is the most important aluminium ore It is largely made up of the minerals Gibbsite Al3 Boehmite AlO and Diaspore AlO together with the iron oxides Goethite and Hematite the clay mineral Kaolinite and small amounts of Anatase TiO2 It was named after the village Les Baux de Provence in southern France where it was first discovered in 1821 by geologist Pierre Berthier

There are two main kinds of bauxite ores carbonate bauxites and silicate bauxites Carbonate bauxites were discovered earlier and occur mainly in Europe and Jamaica above carbonate rocks such as limestone and dolomite

The lateritic bauxites occur in many countries of the tropical belt They were formed from various silicate rocks such as granite gneiss basalt syenite and shale

Forming bauxite demands intense weathering conditions with very good drainage Bauxite deposits with highest aluminium content are frequently located below an iron bearing surface layer In lateritic bauxite the aluminum hydroxide contained in lateritic bauxite deposits is almost entirely a form called gibbsite

Chalcopyrite is the main ore of copper It is mostly copper iron sulphide It is also known as peacock ore or peacock copper It is often mistaken for bornite

Hematite or haematite is the main ore of iron It is mostly iron oxide It has a metallic luster It has no cleavage but does have a fracture The fracture is irregular and uneven Hematite on the hardness scale is 5 to 6 It has a bright red to dark red streak To find the streak you take a piece of unglazed porcelain and take the mineral and run it across the plate The colors vary from metallic gray to a dark rough and earthy red color Hematite has a chemical formula of Fe2O3

Galena is the main ore of lead It is mostly lead sulphide

Galena is one of the most common and widely used sulfide minerals It crystallizes in the cubic crystal system often showing octahedral forms It is often found with the minerals sphalerite calcite and fluorite

Robert Joseph Dole is a former United States Senator from Kansas He was the Republican leader of the Senate from 1985 until 1996 In 1996 he ran against Bill Clinton for President and lost After that he retired from politics at age 72

The scrotum is the bag that holds the testicles in male mammals It is made of skin and muscle and is found between the penis and anus It is often covered in pubic hair and becomes tight when the male is aroused

The function of the scrotum is to keep the testicles less warm than the rest of the body Human testicles work best at 368 degrees Celsius when normal body temperature is 37 degrees Celsius Higher temperatures than 368 degrees will damage the sperm inside the testicles

The temperature is controlled by moving the testicles closer to the abdomen when they are too cold and away when too hot This is done by muscles contracting or relaxing This lifts and lowers the testicles inside the scrotum They can also be lifted by tightening the anus and pelvic muscles

The best temperature varies between species but usually its a bit cooler than body temperature This means that the testicles always have to be held outside of the body

Another explanation is to protect the testes from jolts and being crushed inside the body Animals that have slow movements  such as elephants whales and moles  have internal testes and no scrotum

Ministry was an American industrial metal band from Chicago Illinois It was started in 1981 by musician Al Jourgensen After 27 years and 11 albums Al disbanded the group in 2008

An ulcer is a kind of open wound Ulcers can be on surfaces of the body They can be on skin They can be mucous membranes like the surface of the stomach or inside the mouth

Ulcers start when the top layer of skin or mucous membrane is hurt This top layer dies When it dies the skin or mucous membrane and opens This leaves an open sore called an ulcer

Ulcers can be from infection with germs Ulcers can be from pressure on a part of the skin Ulcers can be from substances that will burn skin or mucous membranes When acid makes some stomach ulcers this is from burning by the acid Ulcers can be from cancer Ulcers can be from diseases of blood vessels If not enough blood goes to a body part it can get an ulcer Stress can also sometimes cause ulcers They are also noted to hurt a lot
