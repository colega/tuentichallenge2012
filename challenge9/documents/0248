A cryptographic hash function is a transformation that takes an input and returns a fixed size string which is called the hash value 

The ideal hash function has three main properties

Functions with these properties are used as hash functions for a variety of purposes not only in cryptography Practical applications include message integrity checks digital signatures authentication and various information security applications 

A hash function takes a string of any length as input and produces a fixed length string which acts as a kind of signature for the data provided In this way a person knowing the hash value is unable to know the original message but only the person who knows the original message can prove the hash value is created from that message

A cryptographic hash function should behave as much as possible like a random function while still being deterministic and efficiently computable A cryptographic hash function is considered insecure from a cryptographic point of view if either of the following is computationally feasible

An attacker who can find any of the above computations can use them to substitute an authorized message with an unauthorized one

Ideally it should be impossible to find two different messages whose digests are similar nor would one want an attacker to be able to learn anything useful about a message given only its digest Of course the attacker learns at least one piece of information the digest itself by which the attacker can recognise if the same message occurred again

In various standards and applications the two most commonly used hash functions are MD5 and SHA 1 

In 2005 security defects were identified showing that a possible mathematical weakness might exist like attacks and recommending a stronger hash function 

In 2007 the National Institute of Standards and Technology announced a contest to design a hash function which will be given the name SHA 3 and be the subject of a FIPS standard

Data integrity is a term used in computer science and telecommunications that can mean

Simply data integrity is to make sure that data is consistent and correct

There are two different meanings of the word cryptosystem 

In this meaning the term cryptosystem is used as shorthand or as an abbreviation for cryptographic system A cryptographic system is any computer system that involves cryptography Such systems include for instance a system for secure electronic mail which might include methods for digital signatures cryptographic hash functions key management techniques and so on 

In this meaning a cryptosystem refers to a set of algorithms needed to implement a method of encryption and decryption 

Typically a cryptosystem consists of three algorithms 

The term cipher is often used to refer to a pair of algorithms Therefore the term cryptosystem is most often used when the key generation algorithm is important For this reason the term cryptosystem is commonly used to refer to public key techniques however both cipher and cryptosystem are used for symmetric key techniques

The Internet Security Glossary RFC 2828 advises against using the term cryptosystem giving the following definitions

Serpent is a symmetric key block cipher which was the second finalist in the Advanced Encryption Standard contest after Rijndael Serpent was designed by Ross Anderson Eli Biham and Lars Knudsen

Serpent has a block size of 128 bits and supports a key size of 128 192 or 256 bits The cipher is a 32 round substitution permutation network operating on a block of four 32 bit words Each round applies one of eight 4 bit to 4 bit S boxes 32 times in parallel Serpent was designed so that all operations can be executed in parallel using 32 1 bit slices This maximizes parallelism but also allows use of the extensive cryptanalysis work performed on DES

Serpent was widely viewed as a more traditional approach to security than the other AES finalists choosing a larger security margin the designers estimated 16 rounds to be sufficient against known types of attack but specified 32 rounds as insurance against future progress in cryptanalysis

The Serpent cipher has not been patented It is completely placed in the public domain and can be freely used by anyone 

The 32 rounds make Serpent more secure than Rijndael however Rijndael with 10 rounds is faster and easier to implement for small Block ciphers and on embedded system For that reason Rijndael was selected as the winner in the AES competition

The XSL attack if effective and would weaken Serpent However many cryptanalysts believe that if implementations considered to overcome the XSL attack the XSL attack would be more difficult than a brute force attack

Pretty Good Privacy is a computer program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication PGP is often used for signing encrypting and decrypting electronic mails to increase the security of e mail communications It was originally created by Philip Zimmermann in 1991

PGP and other similar products follow the OpenPGP standard for encrypting and decrypting data 

OpenPGP is on the Internet Standards Track the current specification is RFC 4880 OpenPGP is still under development and the successor to RFC 2440 which is RFC 4880 has been made a proposed standard Many e mail clients provide OpenPGP compliant email security as described in RFC 3156

The Free Software Foundation has developed its own OpenPGP compliant program called GNU Privacy Guard GnuPG is freely available together with all source code under the GNU General Public License and is maintained separately faraway from several Graphical User Interfaces that interact with the GnuPG library for encryption decryption and signing functions Several other vendors have also developed OpenPGP compliant software

In cryptography a weak key is a key which when used with a specific cipher makes the cipher behave in some undesirable way and simplifies breaking the ciphertext  

Weak keys usually represent a very small fraction of the overall key space which means that if someone generates a random key to encrypt a message it is a rare condition that weak keys will cause a security problem However it is considered a good design for a cipher to have no weak keys A cipher with no weak keys is said to have a flat or linear key space

In cryptography the XSL attack is a method of cryptanalysis for block ciphers The attack was first published in 2002 by researchers Nicolas Courtois and Josef Pieprzyk It was claimed that it may break the Advanced Encryption Standard cipher faster than a brute force attack 

AES is already widely used in commerce and government for the transmission of secret and classified information Finding a technique that can decrease the amount of time it takes to break the secret message without having the key could cause wide damage 

In 2004 it was shown by one of the cryptanalysts that the algorithm does not perform as described in its published paper In addition the method requires long effort Unless shortened the technique does not reduce the effort to break AES in comparison to a brute force attack Therefore it does not affect the real world security of block ciphers in the near future However the attack has caused some experts to insert complexities in the algebraic simplicity of the current AES

The XSL attack relies on first analyzing the internal design of a cipher then deriving a system of quadratic simultaneous equations These systems of equations are typically very large for example 8000 equations with 1600 variables for the 128 bit AES Several methods for solving such systems are known In the XSL attack a specialized algorithm termed XSL is then applied to solve these equations and compute the key

The attack is well known and famous for requiring only a handful of known plaintexts to perform Previous methods of cryptanalysis such as linear and differential cryptanalysis often require unrealistically large numbers of known or chosen plaintexts which make them impossible to realize

Tibet and Mongolia signed a treaty called the Treaty of friendship and alliance between the Government of Mongolia and Tibet on February 2 1913 at Urga Today we are not sure if the treaty can be used or not

The Qing Dynasty ended in 1911 After this both Tibet and Mongolia were independent Both had a lamaist head of state The Republic of China did not see them as independent In the treaty both Mongolia and Tibet said they would see each other as independent and help each other in war 

The people who signed for Mongolia were foreign minister Da Lama Ravdan and General Manlaibaatar Damdinsren Those who signed for Tibet were Agvan Dorjiev Chijamts and Gendun Galsan who lived in Tibet Dorjiev was a Buryat a citizen of Russia For this reason the treaty may not be legal The 13th Dalai Lama denied that he had let Dorjiev sign a treaty with Mongolia More importantly neither the cleric nor the Tibetan government has ever signed any treaty The Russian government said that Dorjiev was Russian He could therefore not act as a diplomat for the Dalai Lama The Mongolian text of the treaty has been published by the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in 1982

Most other people still did not see Mongolia or Tibet as independent They said that these areas belonged to China Western powers had made treaties with the Qing Dynasty and China had said it would honour these treaties If they had recognised either Tibet or Mongolia these treaties would have become invalid The main Western powers were the United Kingdom and Russia Both feared that if they saw the countries as independent they could come under the influence of the other western powers In their opinion that situation was worse than if China controlled both of them because China was weak

British negotiators at the Simla Convention heard about the treaty and got very suspicious They feared that Russia might use the treaty to gain more influence in Tibet In the end China did not sign the Simla Convention Instead a very similar treaty was signed by Mongolia China and Russia on 25 May 1915 This treaty was called the tripartite Treaty of Kyakhta The agreement stated that Mongolia was completely autonomous in internal matters and that Russia had certain privileges in Mongolia At the same time it said that Mongolia was in fact a part of China

In physics dissipation includes the concept of a dynamical system where important mechanical modes such as waves or oscillations lose energy over time typically due to the action of friction or turbulence The lost energy is converted into heat raising the temperature of the system Such systems are called dissipative systems 

For example a wave that loses amplitude is said to dissipate The dissipative nature depends on the nature of the wave an atmospheric wave for instance may dissipate close to the surface due to friction with the land mass and at higher levels due to radiative cooling

In computational physics a numerical dissipation is also known as artificial dissipation or artificial diffusion or numerical diffusion They all mean this when the pure advection equation which by definition is free of dissipation is solved by a numerical approximation method that reduces the amplitude and changes the shape of the initial wave in a way analogous to a diffusional process the method is said to contain dissipation

In Hydrology dissipation is the process of converting mechanical energy of downward flowing water into thermal and acoustical energy Various devices are designed in stream beds to reduce the kinetic energy of flowing waters to reduce their erosive potential on banks and river bottoms Very often these devices look like small waterfalls or cascades where water flows vertically or over riprap to lose some of its kinetic force

Porta Alchemica or Alchemy Gate or Magic Portal is an ancient monument built between 1678 and 1680 by Massimiliano Palombara marquis of Pietraforte in his residence Palombara villa located in the east of Rome on the Esquilino hill in a position almost corresponding to Piazza Vittorio where today was placed Porta Alchemica is the only survivor of the five gates of the Palombara villa there was an lost door on the opposite side enabling to give it a date of 1680 there were also four other inscriptions lost on the walls of the mansion inside the villa

According to a legend dated 1802 sent us by the scholar Francesco Girolamo Cancellieri a pilgrim stibeum was hosted in the villa for a night The pellegrino identifiable with the alchemist Giustiniani Bono stayed for a night in the gardens of the villa in search of a mysterious herb capable of producing gold the next morning he was seen disappearing forever through the door but left behind a few flakes of gold fruit of a successful alchemical transmutation and a mysterious paper full of puzzles and magic symbols that would contain the secret of the Philosophers Stone

The marquis had engraved on the five gates of the villa Palombara and on the walls of the mansion the content of the manuscript with symbols and riddles in the hope that one day someone would be able to understand them

The interest of the Marquis Palombara for alchemy was born probably on his attendance since 1656 at the roman court of queen Christina of Sweden at Riario palace on the slopes of the Gianicolo hill After the queen converted to Catholicism she abdicated the throne of Sweden and he spent much of the rest of his life exiled in Rome from 1655 until her death in 1689

Queen Christina had an alchemical laboratory in Riario palace attended by people like the esotericists Giuseppe Francesco Borri and the learned Athanasius Kircher possessor of the mysterious Voynich manuscript of enigmatic scripture full of magic symbols According to a legend the same Porta Alchemica was built in 1680 as a celebration of a successful alchemical transmutation occurred in Riario laboratory

Between 1678 and 1680 Borri aka Giustiniani Bono collaborated with Athanasius Kircher for construction of Porta Alchemica in Palombara villa Gian Lorenzo Bernini famous architect and Kircher friend designed the door On the door was transcribed the secret formula for producing gold discovery in those years in alchemical laboratory of queen Christina Because of this revelation the Marquis Palombara Bernini and Athanasius Kircher were murdered by poison at 28 November 1680 probably by the same Borri The secret of the Philosophers Stone was lost forever or perhaps continued to be used by Borri

The particular drawing on the pediment of Porta Alchemica with the two triangles overlap and inscriptions in Latin appears almost exactly the same on the title of the book alchemical Aureum Seculum Redivivum of Henricus Madatanus aka Adrian von Mynsicht The title page of the original of 1621 is very different because the design that was inspired the Marquis Palombara appears exactly only in the posthumous edition of 1677 The same drawing appears in a bookmark possessed by Berenger Saunire who became the parish priest at Rennes le Chteau in 1885 The motto Aureum Seculum Redivivum recalled this Novus Ordo Seclorum in the Great Seal of the United States motto also of the Bavarian Illuminati heirs of the 17th century Rosicrucianism

Global apartheid is a term used to mean the worldwide control of resources the economy and government by an ethnic minority The term comes from apartheid a governmental system that ruled South Africa in which the Afrikaners or whites controlled most of the resources and where non whites were denied access to these resources The term is often used to describe the gap between whites and nonwhites and global socioeconomic inequality the existence of which has been proven by statistics European countries control most of the worlds technology and weapons and 20 of the global population the richest percentage take in 713 of income Although most people of the world are not white thereby making whites a minority this minority often holds power in society 

The term was famously used by Thabo Mbeki the then President of South Africa in a 2002 speech drawing comparisons the modern day status of the worlds people economy and access to natural resources to the apartheid era

Leonard and Sheldons geekiness and intellect are contrasted with Pennys social skills and common sense for comedic effect Two equally geeky friends of theirs Howard and Rajesh are also main characters The show is produced by Warner Bros Television and Chuck Lorre Productions The Big Bang Theory was recently picked up for a third and fourth season by CBS 

The show was first developed for the 2006 2007 television season but it was fundamentally different to the show we see today Only Jim Parsons Johnny Galecki were part of the original pilot and the character now played by Kaley Cuoco was much meaner to the geeks CBS did not pick the show up but gave Bill Prady and Chuck Lorre a second chance They brought in Kaley Cuoco along with Simon Helberg Kunal Nayyar and retooled the show

The second pilot of The Big Bang Theory was directed by award winning television directing veteran James Burrows who decided not to stay with the show This reworked pilot led to a 13 episode order by CBS on May 14 2007 Prior to its airing on CBS the pilot episode was distributed on iTunes free of charge The show premiered September 24 2007 and was picked up for a full 22 episode season order on October 19 2007

Production on the show was halted on November 6 2007 by the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike As the strike ended the show was picked up for a second season along with eleven other shows for the 2008 2009 television season

The show returned on March 17 2008 with an earlier time slot and nine new episodes The second season premiered in the same slot on September 22 2008 During the course of this season the show bucked the trend of many other returning shows and saw its ratings grow leading to a two year renewal through what would be the 2010 11 season

Smilodon was a genus of saber toothed cat There were three species Smilodon fragilis was the ancestral smaller species 25 to 05 million years ago 

Smilodon populator was a large heavy species from eastern South America It was 12 m high at the shoulder 21 m long on average With an estimated weight of 220 to 400 kg it was among the heaviest known felids Its upper canines reached 28 cm and protruded up to 17 cm out of the upper jaw 

Smilodon fatalis was the famous cat known from the Rancho La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles The tar a bit like asphalt has yielded about a million bones of late Pleistocene mammals of which 162000 bones are from Smilodon representing perhaps 1200 individuals The cat was about about the size of a female lion but weighed more perhaps 200kg It was about 1 metre tall at the shoulders

The front limbs on these cats were longer and stronger than modern cats and from that and its teeth its method of attack must have been different An educated guess would be they were an ambush predators which clung on round the neck of their prey and slashed at the underside of the throat This contrasts with the method of the modern lion which brings down its prey by weight of numbers and clamps its jaws over the preys nose and mouth The prey dies of suffocation 

Smilodons niche was closer to a leopards which is also an ambush predator They both need cover to get close to prey Smiloddon had relatively short legs and a short bobbed tail Its front legs were especially powerful Its body was adapted for springing onto prey but it was not a very fast runner 

During the last Ice age there were the following possible prey species from the La Brea location Mammoths and Mastodons Ground Sloths Bison Camel Horse Peccary Pronghorn Tapir Deer Most of these went extinct by 5 to 10000 years ago The pressures of a major climate change and human hunting were the main causes

The climate at the time was much cooler than today with more plant cover Juniper Oaks Ragweeds Cedars Redwoods Sagebrush Sycamore Thistle and Walnut grew in the environs Both the herbivores and the cover were essential for its mode of life Smilodon survived so long as game and cover lasted

Secret Diary of a Call Girl is a British television drama broadcast on ITV2 starring Billie Piper as Belle a high class London based call girl The story is based on the blogs of Belle de Jour

The first 8 part series began on Thursday 27 September 2007 at 10pm The second 8 part series began on Thursday 11 September 2008 at 10pm

ITV2 is a 24 hour a day free to air entertainment television channel in the United Kingdom owned by ITV Digital Channels Ltd a part of ITV plc It started on 7 December 1998 and is available on digital television by satellite cable IPTV and terrestrial platforms It is also available by analogue cable television

Belle de Jour is said to be the pen name of a former London call girl Under this name she maintains a successful blog Belle de Jour diary of a London call girl which by 2003 had been selected by The Guardian as its blog of the year and has had two books published in both the UK and US

The name recalls the 1928 novel Belle de jour by Joseph Kessel and the 1967 movie Belle de jour starring Catherine Deneuve directed by Luis Buuel In French Belle de Jour means beauty of the day as opposed to femme de nuit or belle de nuit women of the night

In the 18th century the cloth mill Offermann was a brass factory in the German city of Stolberg It was later changed to cloth mill and then to a restaurant and apartment building The changes show the change of economical needs in that city

The building was founded as a brass factory In the 18th century it was one of many brass factories in the city

At the end of the 18th century the brass industry in Stolberg lost importance The building was sold to a clothier of the nearby village of Imgenbroich He produced cloth for more than 60 years

At the beginning of the 19th century the building was used as a restaurant Some parts of the building were greatly in need of repair 

At the end of the 20th century major repairs were done to the building Currently it is used as an apartment building

The Daleks are a fictional alien race of mutants from the British science fiction television series Doctor Who Daleks are aliens from the planet Skaro integrated within a tank like mechanical casing The creatures are a powerful race who always wanted universal conquest and domination they have no pity compassion or remorse

The Daleks are one of the most powerful races ever in Doctor Who history and are the Doctors worst enemies They cry EX TER MIN ATE when they are about to kill someone They come in different colours like bronze black red white gold and silver They first appeared in the first season episode of the series and they were last seen in the two part episode The Pandorica OpensThe Big Bang They are not robots but horrible aliens kept in a metal casing because they became mutated during a war on their planet Skaro They were created by an evil scientist named Davros They can not be easily hurt by guns as their casing reflects the bullets that come from the gun

Daleks were created by writer Terry Nation and designed by BBC designer Raymond Cusick  They were introduced in December 1963 in the second Doctor Who serial From their first apperence they were very popular with viewers was ment that they were in a lot of later serials and two 1960s motion pictures The word Dalek has been put into the Oxford English Dictionary and other major dictionaries the Collins Dictionary defines it rather broadly as any of a set of fictional robot like creations that are aggressive mobile and produce rasping staccato speech Although there is no meaning to their name Dalek sounds like the Norwegian word drlig which means bad or evil It is also a trademark having first been registered by the BBC in 1964 to protect its range of Dalek merchandise 

The Daleks were on a postage stamp celebrating British popular culture in 1999 photographed by Lord Snowdon

On the outside Daleks resemble human sized salt and pepper shakers who are five to six feet tall with a single robotic eyestalk ontop of a turning dome an exterminator arm which is a energy weapon which looks like an long egg beater or the framework of a paint roller and in some episodes fired a gas and can also be fitted with a projectile weapon and a telescoping robot plunger shaped arm 

Early versions of the Daleks were rolled around on castors or moved by wheels connected to hand cranks by bicycle chains Later versions of the prop had more efficient wheels and were simply moved by the seated operators feet but they remained so heavy that when going up ramps they often had to be pushed by stagehands out of where the camrea could not see The difficulty of operating all the props parts at once contributed to the occasionally jerky movements of the Dalek The latest model of the costume still has a human operator within but the movement of the dome and eyestalk are now remotely controlled so that the operator can concentrate on the smooth movement of the Dalek and its arms

Dalek history inside the show has seen many changes which have caused continuity problems When the Daleks first appeared in The Daleks they were presented as the descendants of the Dals mutated after a brief nuclear war between the Dal and Thal races However in 1975 Terry Nation revised the Daleks origins in Genesis of the Daleks where the Dals were now called Kaleds and the Dalek design was attributed to one man the crippled Kaled chief scientist Davros 

Instead of a short nuclear exchange the Kaled Thal war was portrayed as a thousand year long war fought with nuclear and other weapons causing widespread mutations among the Kaled race Davros experimented on living Kaled cells to find the ultimate mutated form of the Kaled species and placed the subjects in travel machines whose design was based on his own life support chair 

Genesis of the Daleks marked a new era for the depiction of the species with most of their previous history either forgotten or barely talked about again

A single Dalek appeared in Dalek written by Robert Shearman which was broadcast on BBC One on 30 April 2005 This Dalek appeared to be the sole Dalek survivor of a Time War that had destroyed both the Daleks and the Time Lords

The Dalek Emperor returned at the end of the 2005 series having rebuilt the Dalek race with human subjects it saw itself as a god and the new Daleks were shown worshipping it These Daleks and their fleet were reduced to subatomic particles in The Parting of the Ways

The 2006 series finale Army of GhostsDoomsday saw another squad of Dalek survivors from the old Empire known as the Cult of Skaro led by a black Dalek named Dalek Sec that had survived the Time War by escaping into the Void between dimensions They emerged along with a Time Lord prison containing millions of Daleks at Canary Wharf due to the actions of the Torchwood Institute and Cybermen from a parallel world leading to a Cyberman Dalek clash in London Eventually the Tenth Doctor caused both factions to be sucked back into the Void However the Cult members survived by temporal shifting away The two part story Daleks in ManhattanEvolution of the Daleks revealed they had escaped to 1930 New York setting up base in the Empire State Building Experiments led by Sec attepted to force a Dalek evolution by combining their DNA with that of humans and he is the first of the new Human Daleks However the three remaining Daleks rebelled and destroyed him The Cult also attempted to create a HumanDalek hybrid This attempt failed after the Doctor interfered Caan escaped via another temporal shift

The Daleks returned in the 2008 series two part finale The Stolen EarthJourneys End accompanied once again by their creator Davros It is revealved that Dalek Caan had forced himself back into the Time War even though it was time locked where he rescued Davros Davros then created a new army of Daleks from his own flesh The new Dalek army was led by a Supreme Dalek who kept Davros imprisoned in a Vault Davros said that he and the Supreme Dalek had reached an arrangement Davros and the Daleks planned to destroy all creation with a reality bomb which failed due to the interference of the Doctor and his companions and due to Caan himself who had been manipulating the events unknown to either side Though the Daleks were destroyed the fate of Davros and Dalek Caan is unknown 3 Daleks from this episode came back in Series 5 They created 5 new different colored daleks These new Daleks escaped Later they showed up in The Pandorica Opens and trapped the Doctor in the Pandorica the ultimate prison After they were erased from time by the cracks a stone Dalek showed up which was an echo of the Dalek race It was brought alive by the Pandorica light which could restore thing which had been erased by the cracks It was later shot in the eye by River Song Their race along with the rest of the universe was brought back by the Doctor

The vocal cords or vocal folds are two sets of tissue streched across the larynx They can be places in such a way that they vibrate when air passes through the larynx This will produce sounds Humans can use them to produce language

Men and women have different vocal fold sizes Adult male voices are usually deeper  males have larger folds The male vocal folds are between 17 mm and 25 mm in length

The female vocal folds are between 125 mm and 175 mm long

Folds are pearly white  females have whiter chords than males

The difference in vocal fold size between men and women means that their voices have a different pitch Each persons voice is different and has a slightly different pitch This is caused by genes that influence how the larynx is made

The vocal folds discussed above are sometimes called true vocal folds to distinguish them from the false vocal folds These are a pair of thick folds of mucous membrane They sit directly above the true vocal folds to protect them They have a very small role in normal speech formation but are often used in musical screaming and the death grunt singing style They are also used in Tuvan throat singing

The false folds are also called vestibular folds and ventricular folds They can be seen on the diagram above as ventricular folds

Unlike the true vocal cords the false ones grow back completely when they are removed by surgery

Parallel computing is a form of computation in which many instructions are carried out simultaneously depending on the theory that large problems can often be divided into smaller ones and then solved concurrently 

There are several different forms of parallel computing 

It has been used for many years mainly in high performance computing with a great increase in its use in recent years due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling Parallel computing has become the main model in computer architecture mainly in the form of Multi core processors However in recent years power consumption by parallel computers has become a concern

Parallel computers can be classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelismwith multi core and multi processor computers having multiple processing elements inside a single machine while clusters blades MPPs and grids use multiple computers to work on the same task 

Parallel computer programs are more difficult to program than sequential ones because concurrency introduces several new classes of potential software bugs of which race conditions and dead locks are the most common however many parallel programming languages have been created to simplify parallel computers programming But still Communication and synchronization between the different subtasks is difficult while achieving good parallel program performance

In computing optimization is the process of modifying a system to make some features of it work more efficiently or use fewer resources For instance a computer program may be optimized so that it runs faster or to run with less memory requirements or other resources or to consumes less power 

The Optimized system may be a single computer program a collection of computers or even an entire network such as the Internet 

The Pilgrimage of Grace was a revolt in York Yorkshire in 1536 People protested against Englands break with Rome and the Dissolution of the Monasteries There were also other specific political social and economic issues they did not like Technically the term Pilgrimage of Grace only refers to the uprising around York but sometimes it is used in relation to the risings in general which took place around Northern England first from Lincolnshire twelve days before the actual Pilgrimage of Grace

An Embedded system is a computer that has been built to solve only a few very specific problems Very often such systems must give an answer in a specified time This is called real time computing These computers are usually embedded they are parts of different devices In contrast a general purpose computer can do many different tasks depending on programming Embedded systems control many of the common devices in use today

Embedded systems use embedded operating systems which are often real time operating systems These operating systems are designed to be very compact and efficient They leave out many of the functions the embedded computer never uses

Since the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks design engineers can optimize it reducing the size and cost of the product or increasing the reliability and performance 

Physically embedded systems range from portable devices such as MP3 players and digital cameras to large systems like traffic lights factory controllers or the systems controlling nuclear power plants 

Complexity varies from very low with a single microcontroller chip to very high with multiple microcontroller units with peripherals and networks mounted inside a large chassis or enclosure

In general embedded system is not an exactly defined term as many systems can load and run applications For example Mobile devices share some elements with embedded systems such as the operating systems and microprocessors which runs them but are not truly embedded systems because they allow different applications to be loaded and peripherals to be connected like general purpose computers 

Embedded systems are used in all aspects of modern life and there are many examples of their use including

Telecommunications systems uses huge amount of embedded systems from telephone switches to mobile phone network Computer networking uses dedicated routers and bridges to route data

Consumer electronics include personal digital assistants MP3 players mobile phones video game consoles digital cameras DVD players GPS receivers and printers Many household appliances such as microwave ovens washing machines and dishwashers are including embedded systems to provide flexibility efficiency and features

Transportation systems from aeroplanes to automobiles uses embedded systems New airplanes contain advanced avionics such as autopilot inertial guidance systems and GPS receivers Various electric motors are using embedded electronic motor controllers Automobiles electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles are increasingly using embedded systems to maximize efficiency and reduce pollution

Embedded systems range from no user interface at all doing only to one job to complex graphical user interfaces and consoles similar to modern computer with desktop operating systems

Simple embedded devices use buttons LEDs and small character or digit only displays often with a simple menu system

A full graphical touch screen having buttons with the meaning of the buttons changing with each screen as in smart phones

Embedded processors can be divided into two categories ordinary microprocessors and microcontrollers Microcontrollers have many more peripherals on chip reducing the cost and size 

The main differences between embedded CPUs and the general purpose CPUs used by personal computers and servers are

PC104 and PC104 are examples of available ready made computer boards intended for small low volume and high volume embedded systems These often use DOS Linux NetBSD or an embedded real time operating system such as MicroCOS II QNX or VxWorks

In certain applications where small size is un important the components used may be like those used in general purpose computers Boards such as the VIA EPIA range help to narrow the gap by being PC compatible such boards are highly integrated physically smaller or have other properties which make them attractive to embedded engineers The advantage of this method is that low cost products and components may be used along with the same software development tools used for general software development Examples of such embedded devices are the ATMs

A common configuration for very high volume embedded systems is the system on a chip which holds a complete system consisting of processors multipliers caches and interfaces on a single integrated circuit SoCs can be implemented as an application specific integrated circuit or by using a field programmable gate array

Embedded Systems talk with the outside world via peripherals such as

As for other software embedded system designers use compilers assemblers and debuggers to develop embedded system software However they may also use some more specific tools

Software tools can come from several sources

As the complexity of embedded systems grows higher level tools and operating systems are moving toward the embedding industry example of such systems are the open programming environment including Linux NetBSD OSGi or Embedded Java etc

Embedded Debugging may be performed at different levels depending on the features available From simplest to most complicated they can be grouped into the following areas

Unless restricted to external debugging the programmer can typically load and run software through the tools view the code running in the processor and start or stop its operation The view of the code may be as assembly code or source code

Because an embedded system is often composed of a wide variety of elements the debugging strategy may vary For instance debugging a software centric embedded system is different from debugging an embedded system where most of the processing is performed by peripherals An increasing number of embedded systems today use more than one single processor core A common problem with multi core development is the proper synchronization of software execution In such a case the embedded system design may wish to check the data traffic on the busses between the processor cores which requires very low level debugging at signalbus level with a logic analyzer for instance

Embedded systems often reside in machines that are expected to run continuously for years without errors and in some cases recover by themselves if an error occurs Therefore the software is usually developed and tested more carefully than that for personal computers and unreliable mechanical moving parts such as disk drives switches or buttons are avoided

Specific reliability issues may include

A variety of techniques are used sometimes in combination to recover from errors  both software bugs such as memory leaks and also soft errors in the hardware

There are several different types of embedded software designs in common use

In this design the software simply has a loop The loop calls subroutines each subroutine manages a part of the hardware or software

Some embedded systems are mainly interrupt controlled This means that tasks performed by the system are generated by different kinds of events An interrupt could be generated for example by a timer in a predefined frequency or by a serial port receiving a byte

These kinds of systems have a main loop which runs a simple task this tasks is not very sensitive to time Sometimes the interrupt handler adds longer tasks to be executed by the main loop 

A nonpreemptive multitasking system which is very similar to the simple control loop design except that the loop is hidden in an API The programmer defines a set of tasks each task gets its turn to run when it finsh it calls a routine to run the next task

Unlike simple control loop systems adding new software is easier by simply writing a new task and adding it to the tasks queue

In this type of system a certain method is used to switch between tasks or threads based on a timer interrupt At this level the system is considered to have an operating system kernel and can run tasks in parallel

Because of the complexities of parallel computing it is common to buy a real time operating system allowing programmers to concentrate on embedded applications and devices functionality rather than operating system details

A microkernel is a logical step up from a real time operating system The usual arrangement is that the operating system kernel allocates memory and switches the CPU to different threads of execution User mode processes implement major functions such as file systems network interfaces etc

In general microkernels succeed when the task switching and inter task communication is fast and fail when they are slow

Exokernels communicate in a good way by normal subroutine calls The hardware and software in the system are available to and extendable by application programmers

In this case a large kernel with complex capabilities and features is used by the embedded system This gives programmers an environment similar to a desktop operating system like Linux or Microsoft Windows and is therefore very good for development However requires more hardware resources more expensive and can be less reliable because of the complexity of these kernels

Common examples of embedded monolithic kernels are Embedded Linux and Windows CE

Other than the higher price of hardware many peoples like this type of embedded systems especially for more powerful devices such as Wireless Routers and GPSs Here are some of the reasons

In addition to the embedded operating system many embedded systems have additional upper layer software components These components consists of networking protocol stacks like TCPIP FTP and HTTP also includes storage features like disk partitioning and Flash memory management systems

WrestleMania VI was the sixth WrestleMania and the first WrestleMania to be held outside of the United States It was up from the last WrestleManias attendance which was 18946

Real time computing is a field of Computer science The idea is to design systems that have a real time constraint Real time systems will guarantee to give a result within a specified time There are two kinds of real time systems

An airbag is a part of the safety restraint system in cars Airbags are bags that rapidly fill with air when an accident happens That way they can prevent injuries that occur because the driver hit a hard object

An airbag is a useful vehicle safety device Airbags are used in the world increasingly because in accidents it can help passengers reduce shock When the sensor feels a strong shock the gas device explodes This gas fills the bag immediately 

An American inventor Dr Allen S Breed invented and developed a key component for automotive use Breed Corporation then marketed this innovation first in 1967 to Chrysler A similar Auto Ceptor crash restraint developed by Eaton Yale Towne Inc for Ford was soon offered as an automatic safety system in the USA The Italian Eaton Livia company offered a variant with localized air cushions

The first patent on an inflatable crash landing device for airplanes was filed during World War II In the 1980s the first commercial airbags appeared in automobiles Since model year 1990 all new cars sold in the United States have been required to have airbags on both driver and passenger sides To date statistics show that airbags reduce the risk of dying in a direct frontal crash by about 30 percent Today some cars have six or even eight airbags

First moving objects have momentum If no outside force acts on an object the object will continue to move at its present speed and direction Cars consist of several objects including the vehicle itself loose objects in the car and of course passengers If these objects are not restrained they will continue moving at whatever speed the car is traveling at even if the car is stopped by a collision Stopping an objects momentum requires force acting over a period of time When a car crashes the force required to stop an object is very great because the cars momentum has changed instantly while the passengers has not The goal of any supplemental restraint system is to help stop the passenger while doing as little damage to him or her as possible What an airbag wants to do is to slow the passengers speed to zero with little or no damage The constraints that it has to work within are huge The airbag has the space between the passenger and the steering wheel or dashboard and a fraction of a second to work with Even that tiny amount of space and time is valuable however if the system can slow the passenger evenly rather than forcing an abrupt halt to his or her motion

In 2006 the airbag was set up for a motorcycle This was in the Gold Wing by Honda

Fucking is an Austrian village in the municipality of Tarsdorf in the Innviertel region of western Upper Austria

The village is 33 kilometres north of Salzburg four kilometres east of the German border and can be travelled to in half an hour by car from the town of Petting in Bavaria

Fucking has existed since at least 1070 and is named after a man from the 6th century called Focko In old Germanic ing is used to describe people as belonging to their leader so Fucking means Fockos people The village has a population of 104

Fuckings most famous feature is a traffic sign with its name on it which tourists often photograph This street sign is often stolen Significant public funds have been spent on replacing the stolen signs

In 2004 because many signs had been stolen a vote was held to change the village name but the villagers voted not to change In August 2005 the road signs were welded to a very strong pole Some signs have been stolen since 2005 but not as manyFactdateSeptember 2008

Ravenscraig is an area of land in North Lanarkshire Scotland It used to be the site for steelworks Ravenscraig used to have the largest steel mill in Western Europe Ravenscraig was closed in 1992 and is now almost totally demolished

Ravenscraig is now at the start of a major redevelopment by Wilson Bowden Developments Ltd Scottish Enterprise and Corus to create a full new town

Ravenscraig is very easy to get to More than twothirds of Scotlands population live within 90 minutes drive

Located in North Lanarkshire Ravenscraig is between the towns of Wishaw and Motherwell who house a population of over 60000 

Ravenscraig lies only a few minutes drive from both the M74 and the M8 motorways which lead to Glasgow and Edinburgh Scotlands two largest cities allowing easy access for commuters and visitors to the area

Another steel maker Colvilles decided to expand their business in July 1954 They were the largest steel manufacturer before World War II

In 1954 Colvilles began the first stages of development in Ravenscraig Turning Ravenscraig from an empty field into a site for steelworks By 1957 most of the machinery was built and by 1959 the full building work was complete

The closure of Ravenscraig in 1993 was the end of large scale steel making in Scotland and was the cause of a loss of 770 jobs and another 10000 job losses directly and indirectly linked

In its current state Ravenscraig is one of the largest derelict sites in Europe measuring over 1125 acres in size an area equivalent to 700 football pitches or twice the size of Monaco

After many years of planning Ravenscraig will be rebuilt by three equal companies Wilson Bowden Developments Ltd Scottish Enterprise and Corus and will be one of the largest regenerations in Europe with 400 acres being developed 

Ravenscraig will be home to several new facilities

Part of the development will be to create new habitats for the wildlife already living in the area such as deer foxes hares otters badgers watervoles butterflies and many birdsAn Ecological Clerk of Works has been appointed to make sure the building works do not affect wildlife

It is hoped that the 29million redevelopment of the sports complex will be used as training camps for the 2012 London Olympics and the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow

There are many people who disagree with the building work Many local residents and small businesses think that it will take jobs and customers from other towns

As part of the changes the transport to Ravenscraig will be improved There will be new transport within walking distance of the new town centre With new bus services to Glasgow and Lanark There will be easy access to public transport throughout the site including dedicated business routes These will link to the public transport network with roads to the Motherwell and Carfin rail stations

Local press has suggested that the local Scottish Premier League football team Motherwell Football Club could buy some land in Ravenscraig to build a new football stadium leaving behind their home of 113 years Fir Park Motherwell Chairman John Boyle has said No decisions have been taken and we are simply exploring realistic options at this stage

The inner core is the very center of the planet and is the hottest part of a planet The inner core was discovered by Inge Lehmann in 1929 Inge Lehmann was studying a large New Zealand earthquake An earthquake makes broken wikt linkvibrationvibrations which move across the inside of the Earth The vibrations that Inge Lehmann was studying from the New Zealand earthquake seemed to be moving across something solid in the center of the planet She called this the inner core and wrote about this inner core for many years but it was not proven to exist until 1970 when studies were much more exact I personaly think it should be green

The inner core is between 300 and 400 kilometers wide and more than 5000 kilometers below the earths surface It is believed to be made of broken wikt linkmoltenmolten iron and nickel but the Earth is so heavy that the inner core does not move like a liquid Scientists believe that the inner core may be hotter than the surface of the Sun at near 106000 C

The inner core was thought to be a type of huge diamond because diamonds are made by huge weight pressing down but studying the way the Earth vibrates shows that the inner core is not as solid as a diamond There may be smaller diamonds but it is not possible to know because of the huge heat and weight of the world

All songs written by Dave Mustaine except where noted

A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules From the Centre of the Ultraworld is a mix of a song by the ambient house group The Orb The song is about being in love with a beautiful person The song was at first a Minnie Riperton song called Lovin You The Orbs version was first sold in October 1989 and was in the UK Singles Chart in 1990 at number 78 In April 1991 it was sold as part of the album The Orbs Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld The name is taken from a sound effects track from Blakes 7 on BBC Sound Effects No 26  Sci Fi Sound Effects called The Core A Huge Evergrowing Pulsating Brain which Rules from the Centre of Ultraworld

In 1989 The Orb with Martin Youth Glover developed the musical style of ambient house using samples The best of their musical work came when The Orb recorded music for John Peel on BBC Radio 1 The song then known as Loving You was made quickly with many sound effects and samples from science fiction radio plays nature sounds and Minnie Ripertons Lovin You Before the song was sold by record company Big Life The Orb changed the name to A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules From the Centre of the Ultraworld After the first week of sale Minnie Ripertons record company forced Big Life to remove her voice from the song After the first week another singer sang the song 

The Orbs version of the song was 19 minutes long and became number 78 on the UK Singles Chart 

Hermann Carl Vogel was a German astronomer He was born in Leipzig Kingdom of Saxony

Vogel was one of the first astronomers to use a spectroscope in astronomy He used it to read the chemicals on planets far away and to measure the time it takes the Sun to spin He could read it by measuring the Doppler effect

In 1882 Vogel became the Director at the Astrophysical Observatory Potsdam and he is best known for some work there in 1890 Vogel found that the colour of some stars changed over time becoming red and then later becoming blue His idea was that the star was moving toward and then away from the Earth and that the colour changes were the because of that movement These stars seemed to be orbiting around a hidden star as if they were double stars but the second star could never be seen only known by the colour changing Doppler effect

Volgel proved that Algol was a double star that could not be seen and it was one of the first of these double stars proven to exist

Awarded to Hermann Carl Vogel

Algol also known as the Demon Star is a bright star in the Perseus constellation It is one of the best known double stars that can only be seen in spectroscopes the first star of its type discovered and one of the first variable stars to be discovered before it explodes Algol is made of three stars and the brightest is Persei A These stars partly eclipse each other every 2 days 20 hours and 49 minutes for 10 hours

Bop It is an electronic game made by Hasbro It was first appeared in 1996 when the very first Bop It was made The aim of the game is to test the players reflexes by calling out commands in random order Bop It is still made today and it is still a very popular toy 

In 1996 Hasbro copyrighted the instructions to a handheld game called Bop It The game features 3 different commands which were nicknamed Bop It Twist It and a pull it The game had three different game modes and the maximum score was 100 The score was reported by using different sounds If the player scored 99 or greater a victory celebration would be sounded

In 1998 Hasbro copyrighted the instructions to the Bop It Extreme The game had the same inputs from the Original Bop It but had 2 additional inputs Flick It and Spin It The maximum score was increased to 250 and if the player scored over 150 a victory celebration would be played At 250 it would trigger a different victory celebration

In 2002 Hasbro copyrighted the instructions to the Bop It Extreme 2 This game featured an additional one on one mode and the score reporting in Solo was changed to using numbers

As described in its instruction manual Hasbros Bratz themed Bop It game uses a layout like the Original Bop It The maximum score in Bratz Bop It was 200 After 100 points the victory celebration will play after reporting the score

In 2005 Hasbro copyrighted the instructions to the Bop It Blast describing it as covered under the original Bop It patent and referencing other patents that were pending This newest member of the series again increased the maximum score to a total of 500 and for the first time allowed different high scores for different modes rather than having one high score for all modes collectively Minor vocal additions were implemented such as the announcement of the players score at notable landmarks In addition to the five modes featured in Bop It Extreme 2 a Light Bop mode was added The game also had an optional female voice The game can allow the player to select a male a female or both voices calling the commands The same victory celeration from the original bop it was used to report the 500 highest score This device requires 3 AA batteries to operate

In 2006 Hasbro made the instructions for the Bop It Download Software can be downloaded from httpwwwplaybopitcom which allows users to record their own voice upload beats and sounds Hasbro also made different accent voices Bop It Download has a maximum score of 1000 and 15 difficulty levels It includes the ability to download beats and sounds

In 2008 Hasbro made the instructions for the Bop It At the 2009 London Toy Fair Hasbro demonstrated Bop It Bop It has a new optional input Shout It which requires a player to shout into the microphone The Bop It has three difficulty levels with Novice using only voice commands Expert using a random mix of voice and sound commands and Master calling out voice sound and color commands If the player scores 100 points in either of the less difficult modes the next most difficult mode is unlocked Players that achieve a score of 100 points in Master mode are considered to have beaten the game Hasbro also added a multiplayer game called Party where all the Bop It commands are replaced with body parts 

In 2009 Hasbro made a completely different Bop It game and called it Bop It Bounce It has six different games and it comes with an electronic trampoline and a ball

In 2010 Hasbro made the next Bop It game called Bop It XT It was demonstrated at the UK Toy Fair in 2011 and it is to be released by the end of July This model is similar in appearance to Bop It Extreme however it also features the new Shake It command The game will have four difficulty levels and the same game modes as Bop It Info about Bop It XTref As with Bop It Extreme 2 a headphone socket has been added to allow players to play using headphones or a loudspeaker

In 2009 EA Games made a video game called Hasbro Family Games Night 2 which had Bop It as one of the games that could be played It is available for the Nintendo DS and the Nintendo Wii

In 2011 EA Games made an iPhone application which played exactly like the handheld game It has the same commands from the handheld games and added extra commands which were never invented on the handheld game

Shamanism is the name for a number of religious movements Originally it was used by Europeans to describe different religious and magical movements they could observe with certain indigenous people in Siberia from about the 17th century In the 20th century the word was also used to describe other similar movements worldwide

Shamans play a central role in these movements as they can be in both worlds this one and the world of spirits

Shamanism is different from animism Unlike this kind of religion it is not an organised movement

A real time operating system is a multitasking operating system designed for real time applications Such applications include embedded systems industrial robots scientific research equipment and others

An RTOS simplifies the creation of a real time applications but does not guarantee the final result will be real time this requires good development of the software 

Real time operating systems use specialized scheduling algorithms in order to provide the real time applications An RTOS can respond more quickly andor predictably to an event than other operating systems 

The main features of an RTOS are minimal interrupt latency and a minimal thread switching latency

The basic two designs for RTOS are

A reduced instruction set computing represents a CPU design method to simplify instructions which do less but provide higher performance by making instructions execute very fast

RISC was developed as an alternative to what is now known as CISC However there are CPU designs other than RISC and CISC Some examples are VLIW MISC OISC massive parallel processing systolic array reconfigurable computing and dataflow architecture

The main feature of a RISC processors is a small core logic which allows designers to increase the number of the register set and increase internal parallelism using one of the following methods

Other features which are typically found in RISC architectures are

Well known RISC processors include Alpha ARC ARM AVR MIPS PA RISC PIC Power Architecture SuperH and SPARC

A complex instruction set computer represents a CPU design method in which each instructions can execute several low level operations such as a load from memory an arithmetic operation and a memory store all in a single instruction The term is used in contrast to reduced instruction set computer

The terms RISC and CISC have become less meaningful with the continued improvements of both CISC and RISC designs and implementations The first highly pipelined CISC implementations such as Intel 80486 series supports every instruction that their predecessors did but achieved high efficiency only on a few simple x86 subset Modern x86 processors also decode and split more complex instructions into a series of smaller internal Micro operations which can thereby be executed in a pipelined fashion thus achieving high performance on a much larger subset of instructions

Examples of CISC processors are the System360 VAX PDP 11 Motorola 68000 family and Intel x86 architecture based processors

A debugger is a computer program that is used to test and debug other programs mainly to solve programming bugs

A tropical storm warning is a special kind of weather advisory that is issued by the National Hurricane Center when tropical storm effects are expected within 24 hours or less Maritime flags indicate this with two square red flags

A tropical storm watch is a special kind of weather advisory that is issued by the National Hurricane Center when tropical storm effects are a possible threat to an area within 36 hours Tropical storm effects include winds from 39 to 73 mph Maritime flags indicate this with a single square red flag

In computing firmware is a computer program that is embedded in a hardware device for example a microcontroller It can also be provided on flash memory or as a binary image file that can be uploaded onto existing hardware by a user Some firmware can also be modded or changed by some really ordinary computer users through curious tools

As its name suggests firmware is somewhere between hardware and software neither too hard or soft Like software it is a computer program which is done by a microprocessor or a microcontroller But it is also linked to a piece of hardware and has no meaning without it

In the past firmware was stored in ROMs but now it is stored in media that can be written to such as EEPROMs and Flashs

Firmware in many machines such as routers can now be updated without the need for additional hardware often by downloading a new version from web to update the device using instructions provided by the device manufacturer

The easiest firmware to update is usually the system boot related firmware such as the BIOS in PCs Some devices such as video adapters and modems frequently rely on firmware that is loaded by the operating system device drivers and thus is updated by the operating system not by the user Some computer viruses and hackers use operating system firmware update facilities to damage the firmware An electronic device is said to be bricked if it is unable to start due to firmware issues

Examples of firmware include

Immunity aware programming is a set of programming techniques used while writing firmware for an embedded system It is used mainly to overcome random errors that can occur in the CPU program counter or register set RAM or any other that can cause failure of the victim device Such random errors may be caused by single event upsets not enough power or by strong electromagnetic signals transmitted by some other source device

Most of these techniques apply to the software in the victim device to make it more reliable while few of these techniques apply to software in the source device to make it send out less unwanted noise For these reasons Immunity aware programming is one kind of

In algebra the discriminant of a polynomial that is equal to zero with real or complex coefficients is a certain expression in these coefficients of the polynomial if and only if the polynomial has a multiple root in the complex numbers 

A single event upset is a change of state caused by a low energy ions or electro magnetic or nuclear radiation or any other kind of interferences that can reach a sensitive node in a micro electronic device such as in a microprocessor semiconductor memory or power transistors The error in the device output or operation caused as a result of the strike is called an SEU or a soft error The SEU itself is not considered permanent damage to the transistors circuits or devices

Doctor Hannibal Lecter is a fictional serial killer He is a character in books by the crime drama writer Thomas Harris Several of these books have been made into movies

Lecter is a cannibal meaning that he eats people He is also highly intelligent so that he can talk to people in a way that makes them afraid or disturbed He employs this unusual technique most famously in The Silence of the Lambs a novel featuring him that was made into a movie starring Anthony Hopkins as Lecter The movie became very popular and won many awards

Lecter considers himself very cultured and often kills people that he thinks are stupid annoying or rude He is a sociopath meaning that he feels no emotion for other people Thus he is able to do whatever suits him on a whim without feeling guilty 

Thomas Harris first wrote about Lecter in his novel Red Dragon which shows how Hannibal Lecter was caught by the FBI and ends up using his intelligence to help the agent who caught him catch another killer named Francis Dolarhyde Will Graham the agent who caught Lecter is at first very offended by Lecters demeanor but comes to appreciate his help when Lecter gives him insight into the way Dolarhydes mind works Dolarhyde believes that he is a god and that he is unaffected by laws and rules He was played by Ralph Fiennes in the movie which was based on the book Anthony Hopkins played Hannibal Lecter

Another movie Manhunter was based on this book and starred Tom Noonan as Dolarhyde and Brian Cox as Hannibal Lecter

Lecter returned in The Silence of the Lambs the sequel to Red Dragon The movie based on this book became very popular The book is about an FBI agent named Clarice Starling who like Will Graham from Red Dragon is trying to catch a serial killer who calls himself Buffalo Bill because he skins his victims like buffalo Starling makes a deal with Lecter in which she will try to get him transferred to another prison if he will help her understand Buffalo Bills mind In the end Starling catches Bill but Lecter escapes from prison fleeing to Italy

Harris next novel was Hannibal It was a sequel to Silence of the Lambs The book told the story about what happened to Hannibal Lecter after he escaped from prison Lector was hiding in Italy He used a false name and drivers license so he would not be caught The book is about a victim of his named Mason Verger Verger survived when Lecter tried to eat his face He now wants to get revenge on Lector Mason Verger captures Lecter He tries to kill him with attack hogs but Lecter escapes Lecter was again played by Hopkins in the 2001 movie

The final book in the series was Hannibal Rising It shows Lecter as a child It tries to explain why he is a murderous cannibal The critics did not like Hannibal Rising as much as they liked the first three books This was mainly because people thought that the was unrealistic They also felt it was not true to the characters Thomas Harris has said in many interviews that he only wrote the book because he was afraid that someone else would write a book about Lecter as a child 

The character of Hannibal Lecter has become very popular in American culture This is mainly because he is so scary Lecter is often thought to be one of the best movie villains of all time next to Freddy Krueger and Norman Bates AFI listed him at 1 on their list Top 50 Movie Villains of All Time

Predestination is a religious concept which is about the relationship between God and His creation The religious character of predestination distinguishes it from other ideas about determinism and free will Those who believe in predestination such as John Calvin believe that before the creation God determined the fate of the universe throughout all of time and space They believe that God orders some people to Heaven and all other people to Hell before they even are born

Predestination The Divine foreordaining or foreknowledge of all that will happen with regard to the salvation of some and not others It has been particularly associated with the teachings of St Augustine of Hippo and of John Calvin

In Hinduism which consists of four schools predestination does not play an important role as most followers believe in karma associated with free will However in the Dvaita school of Vaishnavism the philosopher Madhvacharya believed in a similar concept

Gladiolus is a genus of flowering plants in the iris family Sometimes called the sword lily the most widely used English common name for these plants is simply gladiolus

The genus Gladiolus contains about 260 species of which 250 are native to sub Saharan Africa mostly South Africa About 10 species are native to Eurasia There are 160 species of Gladiolus endemic in southern Africa and 76 in tropical Africa The species vary from very small to the spectacular giant flower spikes in commerce

These attractive perennial herbs are semihardy in temperate climates They grow from rounded symmetrical corms that are enveloped in several layers of brownish fibrous tunics

Their stems are generally unbranched producing 1 to 9 narrow sword shaped longitudinal grooved leaves enclosed in a sheath The lowest leaf is shortened to a cataphyll The leaf blades can be plane or cruciform in cross section

The fragrant flower spikes are large and one sided with secund bisexual flowers each subtended by 2 leathery green bracts The sepals and the petals are almost identical in appearance and are termed tepals They are united at their base into a tube shaped structure The dorsal tepal is the largest arching over the three stamens The outer three tepals are narrower The perianth is funnel shaped with the stamens attached to its base The style has three filiform spoon shaped branches each expanding towards the apex

The ovary is 3 locular with oblong or globose capsules containing many winged brown longitudinally dehiscent seeds In their center must be noticeable the specific pellet like structure which is the real seed without the fine coat In some seeds this structure is wrinkled and with black color These seeds are unable to germinate

These flowers are variously colored pink to reddish or light purple with white contrasting markings or white to cream or orange to red 

The South African species were originally pollinated by long tongued anthrophorine bees but some changes in the pollination system have occurred allowing pollination by sunbirds noctuid and sphingid moths long tongued flies and several others In the temperate zones of Europe many of the hybrid large flowering sorts of gladiolas can be pollinated by small well known wasps Actually They are not very good pollinators because of the large flowers of the plants and the small size of the wasps Another insect in this zone which can try some of the nectar of the gladioli is the best known European Hawk moth Macroglossum stellatarum which usually pollinates many famous garden flowers like Petunia Zinnia Dianthus and others

Gladioli are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Large Yellow Underwing

Cat also is used for small sets of see also for information in the end of text on category pages or talk pages etc

 Usage

A flying possum or glider may refer to any of several marsupial species

The Feathertail Glider also known as the Pygmy Gliding Possum Pygmy Glider Pygmy Phalanger and Flying Mouse is the worlds smallest gliding mammal and is named for its long feather shaped tail Although only the size of a very small mouse it can leap and glide long distances from tree to tree up to 25 metres Like other gliding mammals the Feathertail Glider has a skin membrane between the fore and hind legs thicker than that of the other marsupials like the Sugar Glider but smaller in proportion extending only between the elbows and knees

The Sugar Glider is a small marsupial originally native to eastern and northern mainland Australia New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago and introduced to Tasmania

Around the world the sugar glider is a popular domestic pet It is one of the most commonly traded wild animals in the illegal pet trade where animals are plucked directly from their natural habitats 

In Australia sugar gliders can be kept in Victoria South Australia and the Northern Territory but not Western Australia New South Wales ACT or Tasmania

Sugar gliders are most popular as pets in the United States where they are bred in large numbers Most states and cities allow sugar gliders as pets with some exceptions

The Bismarck Archipelago is a group of islands off the northeastern coast of New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean and part of Papua New Guinea

The first inhabitants of the Archipelago arrived around 33000 years ago after sailing from what is now Papua New Guinea Later arrivals included the Lapita people

The first European to visit these islands was Dutch explorer Willem Schouten in 1616  

The islands remained unsettled by western Europeans until they became part of the German protectorate of German New Guinea in 1884 The area was named in honor of the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck

On 13 March 1888 a volcano erupted on Ritter Island causing a megatsunami Almost 100 of the volcano fell in to the ocean leaving a small crater lake

Following the outbreak of World War I the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force seized the islands in 1914 and Australia later received a League of Nations mandate for the islands They remained under Australian control interrupted only by Japanese occupation during World War II until Papua New Guinea became independent in 1975

In common law legal systems a precedent or authority is a legal case establishing a principle or rule that a court or other judicial body adopts when deciding later cases with similar issues or facts 

The precedent on an issue is the collective body of judicially announced principles that a court should consider when interpreting the law When a precedent establishes an important legal principle or represents new or changed law on a particular issue that precedent is often known as a landmark decision

Precedent is central to legal analysis and rulings in countries that follow common law like the United Kingdom and Canada In some systems precedent is not binding but is taken into account by the courts

Precedent that must be applied or followed is known as binding precedent Under the doctrine of stare decisis a lower court must honor findings of law made by a higher court that is within the appeals path of cases the court hears In the United States state and federal courts jurisdiction is often divided geographically among local trial courts several of which fall under the territory of a regional appeals court and all regional courts fall under a supreme court By definition decisions of lower courts are not binding on each other or any courts higher in the system nor are appeals court decisions binding on each other or on local courts that fall under a different appeals court Further courts must follow their own proclamations of law made earlier on other cases and honor rulings made by other courts in disputes among the parties before them pertaining to the same pattern of facts or events unless they have a strong reason to change these rulings

One law professor has described mandatory precedent as follows

In extraordinary circumstances a higher court may overturn or overrule mandatory precedent but will often attempt to distinguish the precedent before overturning it thereby limiting the scope of the precedent in any event

Precedent that is not mandatory but which is useful or relevant is known as persuasive precedent Persuasive precedent includes cases decided by lower courts by peer or higher courts from other geographic jurisdictions cases made in other parallel systems and in some exceptional circumstances cases of other nations treaties world judicial bodies etc

In a case of first impression courts often rely on persuasive precedent from courts in other jurisdictions that have previously dealt with similar issues Persuasive precedent may become binding through the adoption of the persuasive precedent by a higher court

Long held custom which has traditionally been recognized by courts and judges is the first kind of precedent Custom can be so deeply entrenched in the society at large that it gains the force of law There need never have been a specific case decided on the same or similar issues in order for a court to take notice of customary or traditional precedent in its deliberations

The other type of precedent is case law In common law systems this type of precedent is granted more or less weight in the deliberations of a court according to a number of factors Most important is whether the precedent is on point that is does it deal with a circumstance identical or very similar to the circumstance in the instant case Second when and where was the precedent decided A recent decision in the same jurisdiction as the instant case will be given great weight Next in descending order would be recent precedent in jurisdictions whose law is the same as local law Least weight would be given to precedent that stems from dissimilar circumstances older cases that have since been contradicted or cases in jurisdictions that have dissimilar law

The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has stated

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stated

Precedents viewed against passing time can serve to establish trends thus indicating the next logical step in evolving interpretations of the law For instance if immigration has become more and more restricted under the law then the next legal decision on that subject may serve to restrict it further still

Scholars have recently attempted to apply network theory to precedents in order to establish which precedents are most important or authoritative and how the courts interpretations and priorities have changed over time 

Super stare decisis is a term used for important precedent that is resistant or immune from being overturned without regard to whether correctly decided in the first place It may be viewed as one extreme in a range of precedential power or alternately to express a belief or a critique of that belief that some decisions should not be overturned

In 1976 Richard Posner and William Landes coined the term super precedent in an article they wrote about testing theories of precedent by counting citations Posner and Landes used this term to describe the influential effect of a cited decision The term super precedent later became associated with different issue the difficulty of overturning a decision In 1992 Rutgers professor Earl Maltz criticized the Supreme Courts decision in Planned Parenthood v Casey for endorsing the idea that if one side can take control of the Court on an issue of major national importance that side can protect its position from being reversed by a kind of super stare decisis 

The issue arose anew in the questioning of Chief Justice John G Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito during their confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee Before the hearings the chair of the committee Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania wrote an oped in the New York Times referring to Roe as a super precedent He mentioned the concept during the hearings but neither Roberts nor Alito endorsed the term or the concept 

In a controversial 1997 book attorney Michael Trotter blamed over reliance by American lawyers on binding and persuasive authority rather than the merits of the case at hand as a major factor behind the escalation of legal costs during the 20th century He argued that courts should ban the citation of persuasive precedent from outside their jurisdiction with two exceptions

A Furby is a popular electronic toy or robot more specifically a hamsterowl like creature made by Tiger Electronics which went through a time of being the must have toy following its launch in the winter holiday season of 1998 with continuing sales until 2000 Furbies sold 18 million units in 1998 14 million units in 1999 and altogether in its three years of original production Furby sold over 40 million units and its speaking capabilities were translated into 24 languages A video game of the Furbies was released in 1998 by Hasbro Interactive with many activities Furbies were the first successful attempt to produce and sell a programed robot In 2005 new Furbies were released with voice recognition and more complex facial movements among many other changes and improvements There was a common mistake that they repeated words that were said around them This belief most likely came from the fact that it is possible to have the Furby say certain pre programmed words or phrases more often by petting it whenever it said these words As a result of this myth several intelligence agencies banned them from their offices

David Hampton and Caleb Chung created the Furby in about nine months That was the amount of time between Tiger Electronics showing an interest in his interactive creatures during which Roger Schiffman bought the rights to it and the time they hit store shelves Furbys first public appearance was at the International Toy Fair in 1998 Furbys originally retailed for about US35 and upon release Furbys flew off the shelves in toyshops The demand for these toys during the 1998 holiday season drove the resale price over US100 and sometimes as high as several hundred dollars Furbies sold for over US300 in newspapers and in auctions Nicknames were given to them and sellers gave values to them Some people continue to call their Furbies by the terms wedding Furby tuxedo Furby snowball Furby biker Furby and others All of course were named rare by sellers because they were so hard to find at the time In a sure display of the demand for even one Furby some sellers at the time scammed people out of a lot of money without even having first given them a Furby Parent battles arguments and fights grew higher at the popularity of them and when retail supplies ran out parents turned to the Internet where Furbies could be purchased for two three or more multiples of their retail price This action led to many parents ending up on eBay

In 2005 Furbies were re introduced with the release of the new Emoto Tronic Furby The highly growing emotional realism of the Emoto Tronic Furby has given birth to a number of Furby like special interest groups These communities want to bring features of the Furby experience into human society The most visible of these groups include Furbish to English translators and Furby adoption agencies 

The original Furbies were 6 inches tall The main reason for their popularity was because of apparent intelligence reflected in their ability to develop language skills Furbies can communicate with one another via an infrared port located between their eyes  A simple electric motor and a system of camras and gears close the Furbys eyes and mouth raise its ears and lift it off the ground in a faux display of mobility The originals are still popular with many hackers as they can be dissected and made or changed to do other interesting things including being able to say something insluting or humorous like Shut up In particular they can be to do things their advanced audio capabilities and various sensory interfaces make them popular with the circuit bending community

In 1999 the Furby Babies line was introduced Furby Babies are smaller than the original have higher voices and cannot dance but switch to speaking English more quickly They also have bigger vocabulary and different Easter Eggs and games built into them Baby furbies come in 24 different colors All with white eye lashes six different eyecolors

Book Furbies were also released including an interactive Furby like Gizmo from the movie Gremlins a Furby like Interactive Yoda based on the Star Wars character and a Furby like Interactive ET from the movie of the same name Another friend of furby called Shelby is similar to Furby but looks like a clam has lots of improvement in memory and has a different personality it was released in 2001 and can communicate with the original Furbies and Furby Babies They also have sensors that can sense loud sounds they can sense being upside down and they laugh when you tickle them They also purr when you pet them You can feed them by sticking your finger in their mouth Similarly Shelbys do not have their own names unlike the classic Furbies Shelbys are also capable of knowing if it is talking to a Furby or another Shelby saying phrases such as Wheres Furby  though they cannot tell the difference between a Furby and a Furby Baby  they just think its a Furby In addition to English Shelbys also know some Furbish words and also have their own language called Shelbish

The latest kinds of Furby were released in August 2005 Larger than the other ones the new Furbies have been upgraded with a more emotional face and a voice recognition system letting them communicate with humans Unlike the Furbies originally released just one order is necessary to make them sleep and they have an off switch They can communicate with other types of Emoto tronic Furbies though to a smaller amont than the communication between original Furbies and they cannot themselves communicate with the original Furbies They also do not have light sensors and basic motion sensors These Furbies according to the story they come packed with are from Furby Island

In 2006 a new version of Furby baby was released with most notable features being the new look and a more Baby ish appearance in contrast to the Emoto Tronic Furby adult They also have considerably less features than the adult Furby with a very limited vocabulary and a lower level of interactivity Another notable feature of the 2006 Emoto Tronic Baby Furby is the movable legs which unfurl when Furby baby is awakened

The Funky Furby was released in August 2006 outside the US They are limited to two color combinations so far and can sing three new songs and dance They can be taught dance styles and remember them

Furbish is the language which is spoken by the Furbies It is similar to English with a different grammar structure A newly bought Furby starts out speaking entirely Furbish the unique language with short words simple syllables and various other sounds that all Furbies use but are programmed to speak less Furbish as they learn more English as they grow Throughout a Furbys lifetime it gradually learns English words and phrases which it begins to speak in place of Furbish The more English they learn the more they grow making them more muture The Furbish phrase WHOA Me deep sleep would translate into English as Whoa I slept for a long time

These are common Furbish pharses

Furbies may say these Furbish words

In Christianity one way people think of God is as a being that made everything and lives forever The Christian Bible speaks of God as one who is who speaks who sees hears acts and loves Christians believe that God has a will and is a kind all powerful being

Some Christians believe God to be immanent Others believe he will be immanent later Most believe he is also transcendent

Trinitarians see the Christian God as Father Son and Holy Spirit They say that God is one being that lives forever who is inside and beyond nature All Christian denominations say that God is personal to humans and to himself Most Christians believe that God is a spirit

In the Bible God has the personal name Yahweh

God is not seen often by people in the Bible

An audio CD entitled Return to Pride Rock Songs Inspired by Disneys The Lion King II Simbas Pride was released in 1999 Although not promoted as a soundtrack to the movie it contained all the songs from the movie and some additional songs inspired by it by Lebo M The complete track list of the CD

On August 31 2004 Disney released an enhanced soundtrack to coincide with the movies 2 Disc Special Edition DVD However the CD contained everything from the Return to Pride Rock CD except the inspired songs

The Lion King 1 is the prequel to The Lion King made by The Walt Disney Company The movie focuses on the characters Timon and Pumbaa before they met Simba This feature was released on DVD and video on February 10 2004 

Timon and Pumbaa start to watch the original Lion King movie but Timon keeps insisting to fast forward to when they come in because they werent seen in the beginning of the story or anywhere until halfway through Pumbaa suggests telling the audience their story which begins before Simbas journey begins Through this we meet Timons mother and Uncle Max discover why he left his meerkat colony where he learned Hakuna Matata how he meets Pumbaa and the perils they encountered while searching for their dream home

Animatronics is to use electronics and robotics in automated magically moving puppets to make them appear to be alive It is normally used in moviemaking but also in theme parks and other forms of getting out of boredom The best things about it and CGI and stop motion is that it is not a feeling of reality but are some objects moving in the computer The technology behind this has become more large and difficult over the years making the puppets become real

Scar is a fictional character and the main villain in Walt Disney Pictures popular 1994 animated movie The Lion King Scar was voiced by Jeremy Irons with singing vocals by Jim Cummings His supervising animator was Andreas Deja Scar is one of four Disney characters to be nominated for Best Villain in the MTV Movie Awards and is also the only Disney animated character to have achieved this 

In the first movie the animals go and see Simba In the next scene Scar is playing with a mouse telling it that lifes not fair is it Mufasa is mad at Scar for not coming to see Simba Scar tells Simba later on in the movie about the elephant graveyard and says an elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince Opps This is likely a poke at Bambi as in Bambi the main character is the young prince Simba takes his best friend Nala with him and have to go with Zazu the hornbill Zazu talks about Simba and Nala getting betroved This similar to Bambi as Bambi and Faline were supposed to be married and in Felx Saltens original book Bambi A Life in the Woods they were cousins This is another controversy surrounding The Lion King as that other than Mufasa and Scar there are no other grown male lions in the group making Simba and Nala cousins Simba sings a song to distract Zazu away from them and Simba and Nala enter the elephant graveyard They almost get killed by three hyenas Shenzi Banzai and Ed who are friends with Scar Mufasa comes just in time to save Simba and Nala from the hyenas and Mufasa tells Simba about what he did wrong Meanwhile Scar tells Shenzi Banzai and Ed how he plans to get rid of Mufasa and Simba in a song called Be Prepared Scar then tells Simba to wait in the gorge for a to die for surprise A huge stampede ensures and Mufasa saves Simba in time but does not make it in time to save himself from Scar Scar flings Mufasa into the gorge where he falls to his death and tells Simba it was all his fault He tells Simba to run Run away and never return Then he sends the hyenas to go kill Simba but he escapes They shout threats at him saying things like if ya ever come back well kill ya Scar tells the pride about the stampede saying Simba died too When Simba finally meets back with Nala he finds out what Scar has done to the pridelands Simba still thinks hes not who he used to be and that it was his fault Mufasa died and that Scar is the right king But with some help from Rafiki he realizes that he must take his place in the Circle of Life Simba challenges Scar in an epic battle and finds out that it was Scar who killed Mufasa Scar blames everything on the hyenas but Simba does not believe this Simba finally defeats Scar where he falls of a cliff something that happens in many Disney movies and he says ah My friends Shenzi says friends I thought he said we were the enemy Banzi agrees saying yeah Thats what I heard They both turn and say Ed Ed laughs in agreement and Scar tries to explain but the hyenas attack him as a fire starts and everything settles down Simba reclaims his rightful place in the Circle of Life and the next spring everything is back and better than ever The movie ends with Simba and Nala having a cub of their own

Scar appears in The Lion King II Simbas Pride in Simbas nightmare that is similar to the stampede sequence in the first movie Mufasa is falling and Simba is trying to save him But Scar tells Simba to trust him and let go Mufasa falls and Simba is angry Suddenly Scar turns into Kovu and throws Simba into the stampede In The Lion King II the new villain Zira has a group of lionesses that were loyal to him Due to this Simba has banished them to the Outlands In another scene of The Lion King II Kovu is being banished and looks into a puddle of water and sees Scars reflection instead of his own

Scar appears a few times in The Lion King 1 without speaking He last appears as he falls to his death

Bit level parallelism is a form of parallel computing based on increasing processor word size depending on very large scale integration technology Enhancements in computers designs were done by increasing bit level parallelism 

Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute in order to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than the length of the word 

Historically 4 bit microprocessors were replaced with 8 bit then 16 bit then 32 bit microprocessors then 64 bit microprocessors 32 bit processors has been a standard in general purpose computing for about 20 years but now 64 bit processors are taking the lead

Instruction level parallelism is a measure of how many operations in a computer program can be performed in parallel at the same time Consider the following program

Operation 3 depends on the results of e and f which are calculated from operations 1 and 2 so g cannot be calculated until both of e and f are computed However operations 1 and 2 do not depend on any other operation so they can be computed simultaneously If we assume that each operation can be completed in one unit of time then these three instructions can be completed in a total of two units of time giving an ILP factor of 32 which means 32 15 greater than without ILP

One of the goals of compilers and processors designers is to use as much ILP as possible Ordinary programs are written execute instructions in sequence one after the other in the order as written by programmers ILP allows the compiler and the processor to overlap the execution of multiple instructions or even to change the order in which instructions are executed

How much ILP exists in programs depends on the application type for example in graphics and scientific applications the amount can be very large while in cryptography the amount much less

Micro architectural techniques that use ILP include

In recent years ILP techniques have been used for performance improvements in conditions where the difference between processor operating frequencies and memory access times is large As of 2008 a cache miss costs several hundreds of CPU cycles in a main memory access with much longer latency compared when the processor finds that the memory location is in the cache Hence this technique was proved to be insufficient to save the CPU time from waiting for the off chip data Instead the industry is moving towards improveing higher levels of parallelism using techniques such as multiprocessing and multithreading 

Data parallelism is a form of parallel computing for multiple processors using a technique for distributing the data across different parallel processor nodes It contrasts to task parallelism as another form of parallelism

In a multiprocessor system where each one is executing a single set of instructions data parallelism is achieved when each processor performs the same task on different pieces of distributed data In some situations a single execution thread controls operations on all pieces of data In others different threads control the operation but they execute the same code 

For example if we are running code on a 2 processor system in a parallel computing environment and we want to do a task on some data D it is possible to tell CPU A to do that task on one part of D and CPU B on another part of D simultaneously in order to reduce the runtime of the execution 

Data parallelism is used by many applications especially data processing applications one of the examples is database applications Most real programs use a combination of data parallelism and task parallelism

Task parallelism is a form of parallel computing for multiple processors using a technique for distributing execution of processes and threads across different parallel processor nodes It contrasts to data parallelism as another form of parallelism

In a multiprocessor system task parallelism is achieved when each processor executes a different thread on the same or different data The threads may execute the same or different code Different execution threads communicate with one another usually to pass data as they work

As a simple example if we are running code on a 2 processor system in a parallel computing environment and we want to do tasks A and B it is possible to tell CPU a to do task A and CPU b to do task B simultaneously in order to reduce the runtime of the execution 

Task parallelism is used by multi user and multitasking operating systems and applications depending on processes and threads unlike data processing applications Most real programs use a combination of Task parallelism and Data parallelism

In Realtime Operating Systems interrupt latency is the time between the generation of an interrupt by a device and servicing the device which generated the interrupt For many operating systems the OS code is programmed so that devices are serviced as soon as the devices interrupt handler is executed Interrupt latency depends on the CPU interrupt controllers interrupt masking and the operating systems interrupt handling methods

Flavors of Entanglement is the seventh studio album by rock singer Alanis Morissette This studio album was released June 10 2008 in the United States June 9 2008 in Australia and on May 30 2008 in Europe Some singles from this album were Underneath Not As We and In Praise of the Vulnerable Man 

The thread switching latency is the time needed by the operating system to switch the CPU to run another thread In some operating systems running on some hardware switching between threads belonging to the same process is much faster than switching to a thread from different process

The process switching latency is the time needed by the operating system to perform the process context switch to continue executing another process

The Penguin is an enemy of Batman in DC Comics He is played by Burgess Meredith in Batman The Movie and by Danny DeVito in Batman Returns He might by played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman in Batman 3

Batman also known as Batman The Movie is a spin off of the 1960s series It features The Joker Penguin Riddler and Catwoman

A context switch is the computing process of saving and restoring the state of a CPU such that multiple processes can share a single CPU resource The context switch is an essential feature of a multitasking operating system 

Context switches are usually time consuming and much of the design of operating systems is to minimize the time of context switches 

A context switch can mean a register context switch a task context switch a thread context switch or a process context switch What will be switched is determined by the processor and the operating system

The scheduler is the part of the operating systems that manage context switching it perform context switching in one of the following conditions

Context switching can be performed primarily by software or hardware Some CPUs have hardware support for context switches else if not it is performed totally by the operating system software In a context switch the state of a process must be saved somehow before running another process so that the scheduler resume the execution of the process from the point it was suspended after restoring its complete state before running it again

A task is a set of program instructions that are loaded in memory then the address registers is loaded with the initial address to start running the task It is defined as an execution path through address space where part of a plan will be accomplished after executing the task 

Processes are often called tasks in embedded operating systems so task gives a meaning of a real time application which differs from a process A process is an instance of a computer program The kernel creates a process by allocating some memory loading program code from a disk or another part of memory into the newly allocated space building the process tables and other operating systems structures calculating the initial address then executes the process as one or more tasks

Both task and process should be distinguished from event which takes place at a specific time and place and which can be planned for in a computer program In a computer graphical user interface an event can be as simple as a mouse click or keystroke

In computing a process is an instance of a computer program that is being sequentially executed by a computer system that has the ability to run several computer programs concurrently

A computer program itself is just a passive collection of instructions while a process is the actual execution of those instructions 

Several processes may be associated with the same program for example opening up several windows of the same program often means more than one process is being executed In the computing world processes are formally defined by the operating systems running them and so may differ in detail from one OS to another for example in Microsoft Windows environment each instance of the same application is called a task

Viktor is at first very happy that this is a success and has her star in more movies For her voice he simply speaks into a microphone and the computer makes it a female voice He conducts interviews Simone goes on to win an Academy Award and is wildly famous However Viktor soon becomes unhappy with Simone and tries to make her unpopular by having her star in a bad movie However the people still love Simone and the movie is still a success Finally Viktor uses a virus and erases her program from the computer He then throws a trunk full of CDs into the ocean

The police come and arrest Viktor and charge her for the murder of Simone They have a video showing him dragging the trunk into the ocean they believe that there was a body inside He tells them that Simone was never real but they dont believe him His ex wife Elaine and his daughter Lainey enter his studio Lainey ejects the floppy disk restoring the Simone program and they create a short movie that shows that Simone is alive and well The police let him go Elaine and Lainey convince Viktor that Simone is a symbol now and that they should continue to keep her alive The last scene shows Viktor and Simone together with Viktor announcing that Simone and he just had a child

Joseph Byrne also known as Joe Byrne was an Australian bushranger He is known as the lieutenant of the Kelly Gang He was shot dead in the siege of Glenrowan Joe Byrne was a very good shot a good horseman and skilled at living in the bush This made it difficult for the police to capture him His skill at writing helped him to write the items that were important in starting the Kelly legend He wrote the famous Jerilderie letter There is also a legend that Ned Kelly with Byrnes help was going to start an independent republic in north east Victoria The siege at Glenrowan was the first step

Joe was born at Woolshed near Beechworth in November 1856 His father Patrick Byrne had come from County Carlow Ireland in 1849 to join his father Joseph who had come to Australia as a convict in 1834 Joes mother was an Irish girl from Galway The family moved to Sebastopol a small gold mining town about two kilometres farther up the valley Joe learned to speak Chinese from the Chinese miners who lived in a small camp near his house He was educated at a small Roman Catholic school at Woolshed

After leaving school in 1870 Joe had a number of jobs including driving a delivery cart for a tannery putting up fences looking for gold wood cutting and shearing He often visited the Chinese village at Beechworth and became addicted to opium During the celebrations for the Prince of Wales birthday in 1873 Joe saw a suit of Chinese armour in the Beechworth museum This armour provided the ideas for the armour the Kelly Gang wore at Glenrowan

In September 1873 Byrne was in court for taking a neighbour Anton Wicks horse He had ridden it for several days before bringing it back He had to pay a fine of 20 shillings In December 1875 he was in court again for taking a saddle but the court believed Byrne when he said he had found it in the bush On May 20 1876 Joe Byrne and his friend Aaron Sherritt stole a cow and cut it up for the meat Someone saw them and told the police They were taken to court and given six months in the Beechworth Gaol In prison Byrne and Sherritt met Jim Kelly who was the brother of Ned and Dan Kelly Joe Byrne met Ned Kelly in 1876 and they became friends

Byrne was probably at the Kelly house on 15 April 1878 when Constable Fitzpatrick said that Ned Kelly shot him and that Ellen Kelly Neds mother had hit him over the head with a shovel Ned and Dan Kelly went into hiding in the bush at Bullock Creek an old gold mining area The police offered a reward of 100 for them and Ellen Kelly was sent to gaol for three years

Joe Byrne was at Stringybark Creek with the Kelly brothers and Steve Hart on 26 October 1878 when they found four police officers on their trail and shot three of them dead Joe Byrne shot dead Trooper Scanlon and was wearing Scanlons ring at the time of his death The gang were made outlaws on 15 November 1878 which meant they could be legally killed by anyone at any time A reward of 2000 pounds was offered for them dead or alive

Byrne was Kellys lieutenant and the two of them planned the gangs actions The Kelly Gang robbed the Euroa branch of the National Bank of Australia and took over 2000 Joe Byrne wrote a letter in red ink for Ned Kelly which was sent to Donald Cameron a local member of the Victorian Parliament Ned said justice had not been done in the case of his mother and himself It ended For I need no lead or powder to revenge my cause and if words be louder I will oppose your laws

The police locked up over 20 possible supporters of the Kelly gang between January 1879 and April 1879 under the Felons Apprehension Act 1878 This increased public support for the gang especially in north east Victoria Joe Byrne was able to use this increase this by writing a number poems about Ned Kelly and his gang including My Name is Ned Kelly

 My friends are all united

My mates are lying near

We sleep beneath shady trees

No danger do we fear 

Joe Byrne often visited his mother at her house in Beechworth He was also seen drinking in hotels in the town even though there was a reward for him He could do it because of his skill and daring and because the police were badly trained and badly led and because of the support of local people for the Kelly Gang

Kelly and Byrne planned their next robbery for Jerilderie On 10 February 1879 dressed as policemen the gang robbed the Bank of New South Wales at Jerilderie taking another 2000 Byrne wrote the Jerilderie Letter which wanted an independent republic in north east Victoria The money from both the Euroa and Jerilderie robberies was given to the gangs family friends and supporters 

After the Jerilderie robbery the gang went into hiding for 16 months This increased their reputation and embarrassed the government of Victoria and the police The Victorian Government increased the reward for the Kelly Gang to 8000

Byrne and Kelly planned another bank robbery in Benalla in 1880 They thought Aaron Sherritt was being used by police to get information about them Byrne had told Sherritt to tell the police that the gang was planning a robbery in the Goulburn River while they were really planning the Jerilderie robbery Kelly and Byrne believed that Sherritt could no longer be trusted They also knew he was being protected by the police Byrne and Dan Kelly murdered Sherritt on 26 June 1880 Ned Kelly believed that this would bring a large group of police to Beechworth to search for the killers 

The next day the Kelly Gang took over the town of Glenrowan They tore up the railway tracks because they knew the police would travel by train to Beechworth They held over 60 people hostage in Jones Hotel Thomas Curnow the local school teacher escaped and stopped the police train before it could crash on the missing track The police were able to broken wikt linksurroundsurround the hotel

Joe Byrne helped design the armour worn by all members of the gang at Glenrowan This did not stop him from being shot in the groin cutting his femoral artery He was in the middle of a speech about the gang when he was shot He died quickly from loss of blood on 28 June 1880 The police dragged his body out of the hotel before burning it to the ground

The next day his body was hung on the door of the police cells at Benalla and photographed by newspaper reporters It was only removed after a young woman begged the police to let Byrne rest in peacerp26 His family did not take his body and the police would not give it to anyone else they thought a funeral would become a starting point for a rebellion He was buried in an unmarked grave on the edge of the Benalla cemetery 

Dan Kelly and Steve Hart were also killed in the siege and Ned Kelly was captured and tried in Melbourne Ned Kelly was hanged at Old Melbourne Gaol on 11 November 1880 There is a legend that Kelly and Byrne had written a Declaration for the Republic of north east Victoria which was destroyed by the Victorian Government

By writing the letters and the bush ballads and designing the armour Joe Byrne and Ned Kelly helped make the Kelly legend In the following 125 years the legend has grown There have been a number of films made about the Kelly Gang including The Story of the Kelly Gang in 1906 the worlds first feature length movie In 2003 Orlando Bloom played the part of Joe Byrne in Gregor Jordans movie Ned Kelly

Australian novelist Peter Carey won the 2001 Booker Prize and the Commonwealth Writers Prize for the True History of the Kelly Gang This was based on the Jerilderie letter written by Byrne 

Ned Kelly and the Kelly Gang has been made famous by Sidney Nolan wearing the armour designed by Joe Byrne in a famous set of paintings This was used as a scene at the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney

College basketball is basketball played between teams from colleges or universities usually in the United States The most popular American college basketball league is the National Collegiate Athletic Association Basketball in the NCAA is put into three divisions Division I Division II and Division III However there are other college basketball leagues such as the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics College basketball teams are split into conferences which are groups of about 10 teams

Division I of the NCAA has two tournaments to determine who the national champion One tournament is for men and one is for women The mens tournament has 68 teams and the womens tournament has 64 teams These tournaments are often called March Madness

There are some differences between NCAA basketball and NBA basketball

The National Library of Australia is Australias largest reference library It was started by the National Library Act The library has to keep and develop a national collection of library material This includes a broad and complete collection of library material about Australia and the Australian people It is located in Canberra the capital of Australia

The National Library of Australia was officially set up with the National Library Act 1960 It had been working as a National Library not just a Parliamentary Library since 1901

In 1901 a Commonwealth Parliamentary Library was started to help the newly formed Federal Parliament of Australia From its beginning the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library began to develop of a truly national collection In 1907 the chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Library Committee Sir Frederick Holder gave the reasons for having the library Australia should have a great public library like the famous Library of Congress in Washington DC It would be a home for the literature of the world for ever

The library building was opened in 1968

The Librarys collections of Australian objects has become the nations single most important collection of materials recording the Australian cultural history The Library collects Australian materials of all kinds including

The Library has good collections in the performing arts including dance The Library also has big collections of general overseas and rare book materials as well as world class Asian and Pacific collections which add to the Australian collections

The print collections include large collections of microform The Library keeps the National Reserve Braille Collection In total over 5 million items are held Films and sound recordings are kept in a separate collection run by the National Film and Sound Archive in Canberra

The Library has digitised over 130000 items from its collection The 100000th was a photo These digital items can be seen on the Internet The Library is a world leader in digital preservation techniques It keeps an Internet archive of selected Australian websites called the Pandora Archive

An instruction pipeline is a technique used in the design of modern microprocessors microcontrollers and CPUs to increase their instruction throughput

The main idea is to divide the processing of a CPU instruction as defined by the instruction microcode into a series of independent steps of micro operations with storage at the end of each step This allows the CPUs control logic to handle instructions at the processing rate of the slowest step which is much faster than the time needed to process the instruction as a single step 

The term pipeline refers to the fact that each step is carrying a single microinstruction and each step is linked to another step

Most modern CPUs are driven by a clock The CPU consists internally of logic and memory When the clock signal arrives the flip flops store their new value then the logic requires a period of time to decode the flip flops new values Then the next clock pulse arrives and the flip flops store another values and so on By breaking the logic into smaller pieces and inserting flip flops between pieces of logic the time required by the logic is reduced In this way the clock period can be reducedFor example the RISC pipeline is broken into five stages with a set of flip flops between each stage as follow

Processors with pipelining consist internally of stages which can semi independently work on separate microinstructions Each stage is linked by flip flops to the next strange so that the stages output is an input to another stage until the job of processing instructions is done Such organization of processor internal modules reduces the instructions overall processing time

A non pipeline architecture is not as efficient because some CPU modules are idle while another module is active during the instruction cycle Pipelining does not completely remove idle time in a pipelined CPU but making CPU modules work in parallel increases instruction throughput

An instruction pipeline is said to be fully pipelined if it can accept a new instruction every clock cycle A pipeline that is not fully pipelined has wait cycles that delay the progress of the pipeline

Advantages of Pipelining

Disadvantages of Pipelining

To the right is a generic pipeline with four stages

The top gray box is the list of instructions waiting to be executed the bottom gray box is the list of instructions that have been completed and the middle white box is the pipeline

Execution is as follows

When a hiccup in execution occurs a bubble is created in the pipeline in which nothing useful happens In cycle 2 the fetching of the purple instruction is delayed and the decoding stage in cycle 3 now contains a bubble Everything behind the purple instruction is delayed as well but everything in front of the purple instruction continues with execution

Clearly when compared to the execution above the bubble yields a total execution time of 8 clock ticks instead of 7

Bubbles are like stalls in which nothing useful will happen for the fetch decode execute and writeback It can is like a NOP code

The Jurassic Coast is a stretch of coast in south west England It is between Orcombe Point near Exmouth in East Devon and Old Harry Rocks near Swanage in East Dorset This is 95 miles long 

Because of its geology it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site known as Dorset and East Devon Coast Its entire length can be walked on the South West Coast Path

Some of the greatest fossil discoveries were made in this area 

These finds were by Mary Anning in the first part of the 19th century This area was home to Mary a collector who searched for fossils of the coastline around Lyme Regis and discovered several complete Ichthyosaur fossils 

The Jurassic Coast is made of Triassic Jurassic and Cretaceous cliffs spanning 185 million years of geological history

The site contains a number of special features and shows different landforms including the natural arch at Durdle Door the cove and limestone folding at Lulworth Cove and an island the Isle of Portland 

Chesil Beach is one of Englands three shingle beaches It is a barrier beach which runs parallel to the coastline and connects to Portland Bill Between the barrier and the regular coastline is a lagoon

Golden Cap is the highest place on the south coast of England It is convert191mft0 high

This section notes the main rocks found on the coast starting with the lowest

The Blue Lias is a geologic formation in the Jurassic Coast and parts of south Wales It is part of the Lias Group 

The Blue Lias consists of a sequence of limestone and shale layers It was laid down in late Triassic and early Jurassic times between 195 and 200 million years ago The Blue Lias is famous for its fossils especially ammonites Also found were remains of a number of dinosaurs and the pterosaur Dimorphodon

The Blue Lias alternates between limestone and mudstone

These are special towns that are related to the Jurassic Coast

In computer science an instruction is a single operation of a processor defined by the processor instruction set 

The size or length of an instruction varies widely from as little as 4 bits in some microcontrollers to many as multiples of a bytes in some very long instruction word systems Most modern processors used in personal computers mainframes and supercomputers have instruction sizes between 16 and 64 bits In some architectures specially Reduced instruction set computers instructions are of fixed length typically corresponding with that architectures word size 

On traditional architectures an instruction includes an opcode specifying the operation to be performed such as add contents of memory to register and zero or more operand specifiers which may specify registers memory locations or literal data The operand specifiers may have addressing modes determining their meaning or may be in fixed fields

In VLIW architectures which include many microcode architectures multiple simultaneous operations and operands are specified in a single instruction

Instructions are rarely specified using their machine code form they may be specified by programmers using an assembly language or more commonly may be generated by compilers

There is another more general definition for an instruction not only related to the processor instruction set which is An instruction may be any representation of an element of an executable program such as a bytecode

DUPL is a UNESCO Library Network member People from home and abroad visist this library every day

A superscalar CPU architecture implements a form of parallel computing called Instruction level parallelism inside a single processor which allows faster CPU throughput at the same clock rate A superscalar processor executes more than one instruction during a clock cycle by simultaneously dispatching multiple instructions to multiple redundant functional units built inside the processor Each functional unit is not a separate CPU core but an execution resource inside the CPU such as an arithmetic logic unit floating point unit a bit shifter or a multiplier

While most superscalar CPUs are also pipelined it possible to have a non pipelined superscalar CPU or a pipelined non superscalar CPU

The superscalar technique is associated with several identifying characteristics of the CPU core

Each instruction executed by a Scalar processors manipulates one or two data items at a time while each instruction executed by a Vector processor operates simultaneously on many data items A superscalar processor is a mixture of the two

In a superscalar CPU an instruction dispatcher reads instructions from memory and decides which ones can be run in parallel dispatching them on the multiple redundant functional units available inside the CPU 

Superscalar CPU design is concerned with improving accuracy of the instruction dispatcher and allowing it to keep the multiple functional units in use at all times As of 2008 all general purpose CPUs are superscalar a typical superscalar CPU may include up to 4 ALUs 2 FPUs and two SIMD units If the dispatcher failed to utilize all of the units at all times the performance of the CPU will suffer

Available performance improvement in Superscalar CPU design is limited by two key areas 

However even given infinitely fast dependency checking logic inside a conventional superscalar CPU if the instruction stream itself has many dependencies this would also limit the possible speedup Thus the degree of intrinsic parallelism in the code stream forms another limitation

No matter how fast the dispatcher speed there is a practical limit on how many instructions can be simultaneously dispatched While hardware advances will allow greater numbers of functional units the problem of checking instruction dependencies increases to a limit that the achievable superscalar dispatching limit is somewhat small  Likely on the order of five to six simultaneously dispatched instructions

The various alternative techniques are not mutually exclusivethey can be combined in a single processor Thus it is possible to design a multicore CPU is where each core is an independent processor containing multiple parallel superscalar pipelines Some multicore processors also include vector capability

SA80 or Small Arms of the 80s is the name of a weapons family used by the British Army and Royal Marines all are of bullpup design meaning the magazine is placed behind the trigger allowing the weapon to be shorter yet still have a long barrel

The series includes an assault rifle known as the L85 and a Light Support Weapon designated the L86 as well as a Carbine variant for helicopter crews and a bolt action army cadet variant The LSW variant is far more accurate than its predecessor and is prominent in army FSGs And although amazingly accurate for their size the SA80 family has been plagued by poor reliability problems that have been addressed with an upgrade by the German arms company HK when it was British owned resulting in the A2 series however not all models have been upgraded and A1 generations can be recognized by their simple circular cocking handle A new upgrade program is under way for a very small number of SA80s since late 2007

The SA80 also has a cadet force variant that is the same size but has no change lever and is used throughout the ACF with a success rate far higher than the old bolt action A1 version

In computer engineering an execution unit is a part of a CPU that performs specific operations or calculations It may have its own internal control sequence unit some registers and other internal units such as a sub ALU or FPU or some smaller more specific components

Now modern CPUs have multiple parallel execution units referred to as scalar or superscalar design The simplest arrangement is to use one the bus manager to manage the memory interface and the others to perform calculations Additionally modern CPUs execution units are usually pipelined

Observation info for years before 1492 is completely unavailable because record keeping was non existent in the pre Columbian era and any records that may have once existed have long since been lost Even info from the early years of the Columbian era is suspect and incomplete because the difference between a hurricane and an extratropical system was not drawn by Renaissance scientists and sailors and because European exploration and colonization of the regions affected by hurricanes did not begin in earnest until the mid 16th century

However paleotempestological research allows reconstruction of pre historic hurricane activity trends on timescales of centuries to millennia A theory has been postulated that an anti phase pattern exists between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast During the quiescent periods a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast During the hyperactive period more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores Highcontrolled by the North Atlantic Oscillationwas shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean In fact few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 30001400 BC and again during the most recent millennium these quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 35 times On the Atlantic coast chance of landfalling hurricanes has doubled in the recent millennium compared to the one and a half millennia before

Simultaneous multithreading acronym SMT is a technique for improving the overall efficiency of superscalar CPUs with Hardware multithreading SMT permits multiple independent threads of execution to better utilize the resources provided by modern computer architectures

Multithreading is similar in concept to multitasking but is implemented at the thread level of execution in modern superscalar processors

In processor design there are two ways to increase on chip parallelism with less resource requirements 

There are many ways to support more than one thread inside a chip namely

The key factor to distinguish them is to look at how many instructions the processor can issue in one cycle and how many threads from which the instructions come 

In computer engineering out of order execution OoOE is a technique used in most high performance microprocessors to make use of cycles that would otherwise be wasted by a certain type of costly delay Most modern CPU designs include support for out of order execution

The key concept of OoO processing is to allow the processor to avoid a class of delays that occur when the data needed to perform an operation are unavailable

OoO processors fill these slots in time with other instructions that are ready then re order the results at the end to make it appear that the instructions were processed as normal The way the instructions are ordered in the original computer code is known as program order in the processor they are handled in data order Fairly complex circuitry is needed to convert from one ordering to the other and maintain a logical ordering of the output the processor itself runs the instructions which seems as if in random order

The benefit of OoO processing grows as the instruction pipeline expands and the speed difference between main memory and the processor increases On modern machines the processor runs many times faster than the memory so during the time an in order processor spends waiting for data to arrive it could have processed a large number of instructions

In earlier In order processors the processing of instructions is normally done in these steps

Out of order processors breaks up the processing of instructions into these steps

In the examples outlined above the OoO processor avoids the stall that occurs in step of the in order processor when the instruction is not completely ready to be processed due to missing data

In computer science speculative execution is the execution of code before being sure if the result will be needed 

The technique is used in most high performance microprocessors to execute a complete instructions or parts of instructions before being sure whether this execution is required

In the context of functional programming the term speculative evaluation is used instead

In computer architecture a branch predictor is the part of a processor that determines whether a conditional branch in the instruction flow of a program is likely to be taken or not This is called branch prediction 

Branch predictors are important in todays modern superscalar processors for achieving high performance They allow processors to fetch and execute instructions without waiting for a branch to be resolved

Almost all pipelined processors do branch prediction of some form because they must guess the address of the next instruction to fetch before the current instruction has been executed 

Many earlier microprogrammed CPUs did not do branch prediction because there was little or no performance requirements for this reason there is no need for altering the flow of the instruction stream

Key exchange is any method in cryptography by which cryptographic keys are exchanged between users allowing use of a cryptographic system 

If two parties wish to exchange encrypted messages each needs to know how to decrypt received messages and to encrypt sent messages The information they require to do so depends on the encryption technique they might use If they use a code both will require a copy of the same codebook If they use a cipher they will need appropriate keys If the cipher is a symmetric key cipher both will need a copy of the same key If an asymmetric key cipher with the publicprivate key property both will need the others public key 

The key exchange problem is how to exchange whatever keys or other information needed so in such a way that no one else can obtain a copy Usually this required trusted secure channel With the arrival of cipher algorithms the encrypting key could be made public since no one without the decrypting key could decrypt the message 

In principle then the only remaining problem was to be sure that a public key actually belonged to its claimed owner this is not a problem easy to solve specially when the two users involved have never met and know nothing about each other

In 1976 Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published a cryptographic protocol which allows users to establish secure channels in order to exchange keys even if an attacker is monitoring that communication channel However Diffie Hellman key exchange did not address the identity authentication problem of being sure of the actual identity of the person or an entity

Public key infrastructures have been proposed go around the problem of identity authentication In their most usual implementation each user applies to a certificate authority for a digital certificate which serves for other users as a correct authentication of identity

In contrast the web of trust system which do not use central certificate authority at all Each user is responsible for verifying any certificate from another user before using that certificate to communicate with the user who claims to be associated with the particular public key in a certificate 

The problem of key exchange has not yet been solved In particular it has not yet been solved for the modern situation of two previously unknown users attempting to communicate electronically as for instance in electronic commerce Some of the existing work around designs work more or less but are not fully satisfactory

In cryptography a secure channel is a way of transferring data that is very difficult to overhear or copy and understand decrypt or change

A confidential channel is a way of transferring data that is resistant to interception but not necessarily resistant to tampering nor necessarily resistant to impersonation by someone else

An authenticatable channel is a way of transferring data that is resistant to spoofing but not necessarily resistant to interception or tampering

Terminology is the study of terms and their use Terms are words and compound words that are used in specific contexts Not to be confused with terms in everyday usages the shortened form of technical terms which are defined within an academic system or a field of specialty Terminology studies among other things how such terms of art come to be and their interrelationships within a culture

Terminology therefore refer to a more formal discipline which systematically studies the labelling or designating of concepts specific to one or more subject fields or domains of human activity through research and analysis of terms in context for the purpose of documenting and promoting correct usage This study can be limited to one language or can cover more than one language at the same time or may focus on studies of terms used in teaching across different fields

There are 261 communes in the Vaucluse department in France all included in the following list

Technical terminology is the specialized vocabulary of a field These terms have specific definitions within the field which is not necessarily the same as their meaning in common use Jargon is similar but more informal in definition and use while legal terms of art or words of art have meanings that are strictly defined by law

An industry term is a type of technical terminology that has a particular meaning within a specific industry The phrase industry term implies that a word or phrase is a typical one within a particular industry or business and people within the industry or business will be familiar with and use the term

The term jargon can and often does have pejorative connotations particularly when aimed at business culture The marketing and public relations industries in particular have expanded the vocabulary of jargon that marks the global business environment

Mrindol is a commune of 1923 people It is in the region Provence Alpes Cte dAzur in the Vaucluse department in the south of France The town has a Mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers and mild winters It does not rain very often and snow is rare Protected by the Luberon a mountain range the town is sheltered from the mistral a cold dry wind that blows from the north The town was first built on a hill which was easy to defend After the town was destroyed in 1545 it was rebuilt on the plain near the river

A ferry was in use to cross the Durance River in the year 1240 Mrindol was abandoned probably because of plague in the 15th century 

In the late Middle Ages Louis II of Provence sold the land to the lords of Abacus Cental and Rocca Sparviera They moved in farming families from Piedmont The farmers were followers of Pierre Vaudes They were part of a group known as the Vaudois or Waldensians who had separated from the Catholic Church in 1170 They believed in a simple life based on a line in the Gospel of Matthew This put them in opposition to the rich and powerful church In 1530 a Dominican priest Jean de Roma began a campaign against the Vaudois because he said they were heretics His gangs attacked the town and burnt many houses and killed many of the people

In 1540 de Roma arrested a flour miller from Mrindol took his mill and then burned the man at the stake On November 18 1540 19 more people were sentenced to death by burning at the stake and the town was ordered to be completely destroyed A group from the town went to the king to save the people and the village He gave them until 1545 AD to give up their religion and rejoin the Catholic Church On April 18 1545 the village was completely burned and about 12 of the Vaudois still living there were killed Over one week there were attacks on 11 other small villages and it is thought that about 3000 people were killed Many of the Vaudois from Mrindol were able to escape and ran away to Switzerland

In 1977 members of Vaudois organizations in Germany France and Italy built a path in memory of the people who had been killed for their religious beliefs The path leads to the ruins of the Vaudois church

Diffie Hellman key exchange is a cryptographic protocol that allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to securely agree on a shared secret key over an insecure communications channel Then they use this key to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric key cipher

Synonyms of Diffie Hellman key exchange include

The scheme was first published publicly by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976 Diffie Hellman key agreement itself is an anonymous key agreement protocol it provides the basis for a variety of authenticated protocols and is used to provide perfect forward secrecy in Transport Layer Securitys short lived modes

In the original description papers the Diffie Hellman exchange by itself does not provide authentication of the communicating parties and is thus susceptible to a man in the middle attack An attacking person in the middle may establish two different Diffie Hellman key exchanges with the two members of the party A and B appearing as A to B and vice versa allowing the attacker to decrypt then re encrypt the messages passed between them A method to authenticate the communicating parties to each other is generally needed to prevent this type of attack

Many cryptographic authentication solutions include a Diffie Hellman exchange When two parties A and B have a public key infrastructure they may digitally sign the agreed key G or GA and GB as in MQV STS and the IKE component of the IPsec protocol suite for securing Internet Protocol communications When A and B share a password they may use a password authenticated key agreement form of Diffie Hellman

The British Royal Family is the group of close relatives of the monarch of the United Kingdom

MQV is an authenticated protocol for key agreement based on the Diffie Hellman scheme MQV provides protection against an active attacker

In computer science runtime or run time describes the operation of a computer program the duration of its execution from beginning to termination 

The term runtime can also refer to a virtual machine to manage a program written in a computer language while it is running 

Run time is sometimes used to mean runtime library a library of basic code that is used by a particular compiler but when used in this fashion runtime library is more accurate

A runtime environment is a virtual machine state which provides software services for processes or programs while a computer is running 

Runtime activities include loading and linking of the classes needed to execute a program optional machine code generation and dynamic optimization of the program and actual program execution

For example a program written in Java calls for services from the Java Runtime Environment by issuing commands from which the expected result is returned by the Java Runtime By providing these services the Java Runtime Environment is considered the runtime environment of the program Both the program and the Java Runtime Environment request services from the operating system The operating system kernel provides services for itself and all processes and software running under its control The Operating System may be considered as providing a runtime environment for itself

A Java Virtual Machine is a set of computer software programs and data structures which use a virtual machine model for the execution of other computer programs and scripts The model used by a JVM accepts a form of computer intermediate language commonly referred to as Java bytecode 

Java Virtual Machines operate on Java bytecode which is normally generated from Java source code a JVM can also be used to implement programming languages other than Java 

The JVM is an important component of the Java Platform Because JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms Java can be both middleware and a platform in its own right hence the expression write once run anywhere The use of the same bytecode for all platforms allows Java to be described as compile once run anywhere as opposed to write once compile anywhere which describes cross platform compiled languages 

The Station to Station protocol is a cryptographic key agreement scheme based on the classic Diffie Hellman key exchange that provides mutual key and entity authentication

In addition to protecting the established key from an attacker the STS protocol uses no timestamps and provides perfect forward secrecy It also requires two way explicit key confirmation making it an Authenticated key agreement with Key Confirmation protocol

STS was originally presented in 1987 in the context of ISDN security HarvOHigginsDiffieStrawczynskido Hoog1987 finalized in 1989 and generally presented by Whitfield Diffie Paul C van Oorschot and Michael J Wiener in 1992

Internet Key Exchange is the protocol used to set up a security association in the IPsec protocol suite IKE uses a Diffie Hellman key exchange to set up a shared session secret from which cryptographic keys are derived Public key techniques or alternatively a pre shared key are used to mutually authenticate the communicating parties

IKE builds upon the Oakley protocol

IKE was originally defined in November 1998 by the Internet Engineering Task Force in a series of publications known as RFC 2407 RFC 2408 and RFC 2409 

IKE was updated to version two in December 2005 by RFC 4306 IKEv2 has been further expanded by RFC 4301 through RFC 4310 More RFCs are being added all the time as the need arises to further develop the features of the protocol

The parent organization of the IETF The Internet Society has maintained the copyrights of these standards as being freely available to the Internet community

The following Open Source implementations of IKEv2 are currently available 

In cryptography a shared secret is a piece of data only known to the parties involved in a secure communication The shared secret can be a password a passphrase a big number or an array of randomly chosen bytes

The shared secret is either shared before parties start to communicate in this case it can also be called a pre shared key Or it is created at the start of the communication session by using a key agreement protocol for instance using public key cryptography such as Diffie Hellman or using symmetric key cryptography such as Kerberos

The shared secret can be used for authentication using methods such as challenge response or it can be fed to a key derivation function to produce one or more keys to use for encryption andor MACing of messages

To make unique session and message keys the shared secret is usually combined with an initialization vector An example of this is the derived unique key per transaction method

In cryptography a pre shared key or PSK is a shared secret which was previously shared between the two parties using some secure channel before it is used Such systems almost always use symmetric key cryptographic algorithms 

The characteristics of this secret or key are determined by the system which uses it some system require that such keys be in a specific format It can be a password like bret13i a passphrase like Idaho hung gear id gene or a hexadecimal string like 65E4 E556 8622 EEE1 The secret is used by all systems involved in the cryptographic processes used to secure the traffic between the systems 

The term is used in Wi Fi encryption such as WEP or WPA where both the wireless access points and all clients share the same key  

Since one weakpoint of the crypto system is the encryption algorithms key the key strength is important and since the strength of a key is in part dependent on the key length it is important to choose a key whose length is cryptographically secure There are several tools available to help one choose a strong key The Diceware method is one example

Internet Protocol Security is a way of making Internet communications more secure and private

IPsec is a collection of protocols for securing Internet Protocol communications by authenticating each IP packet of a data stream IPsec also includes protocols for establishing mutual authentication between agents at the beginning of the session and negotiation of cryptographic keys to be used during the session IPsec can be used to protect data flows between a pair of hosts between a pair of security gateways or between a security gateway and a host RFC 2406

IPsec is an end to end security solution and operates at the Internet Layer of the Internet Protocol Suite comparable to Layer 3 in the OSI model Other Internet security protocols in widespread use such as SSL TLS and SSH operate in the upper layers of these models This makes IPsec more flexible as it can be used for protecting all the higher level protocols because applications do not need to be designed to use IPsec whereas the use of TLSSSL or other higher layer protocols must be built in the application

The term IPsec is officially defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force This definition includes the form of capitalization used for the term it is often incorrectly spelled IPSec

Honored Sir

 I take up my pen just to give you an imperfect account of one of the most dreadful hurricanes that memory or any records whatever can trace which happened here on the 31st ultimo at night It began about dusk at north and raged very violently till ten oclock Then ensued a sudden and unexpected interval which lasted about an hour Meanwhile the wind was shifting round to the south west point from whence it returned with redoubled fury and continued till nearly three in the morning Good God what horror and destruction  its impossible for me to describe  or you to form any idea of it It seemed as if a total dissolution of nature was taking place The roaring of the sea and wind  fiery meteors flying about in the air  the prodigious glare of almost perpetual lightning  the crash of falling houses  and the ear piercing shrieks of the distressed were sufficient to strike astonishment into Angels A great part of the buildings throughout the island are leveled to the ground  almost all the rest very much shattered  several persons killed and numbers utterly ruined  whole families wandering about the streets unknowing where to find a place of shelter  the sick exposed to the keenness of water and air  without a bed to lie upon  or a dry covering to their bodies  and our harbors entirely bare In a word misery in its most hideous shapes spread over the whole face of the country

Many people who are anti nuclear are against the use of nuclear power for electricity generation since they think nuclear power is dangerous They consider the risk of a nuclear accident unacceptable and generally believe that radioactive waste cannot be disposed of safely Many also see uranium mining and nuclear reprocessing as bad because of the environmental risks of these activities The 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents have revived anti nuclear passions worldwide putting governments on the defensive and undermining the nuclear power industrys recent renaissance

Anti nuclear groups believe that nuclear power is a risk to people and the environment These include health risks and environmental damage from uranium mining processing and transport the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation the unsolved problem of nuclear waste and the possibility of further serious accidents Anti nuclear critics see nuclear power as a dangerous expensive way to boil water to generate electricity

Opponents of nuclear energy make connections between the international export and development of nuclear power technologies and the proliferation of nuclear weapons The facilities and expertise to produce nuclear power can be readily adapted to produce nuclear weapons Greenpeace suggests that nuclear power and nuclear weapons have grown up like Siamese twins 

Nuclear power plants are very expensive Making reliable cost estimates is difficult and estimates for new reactors in the USA range from 5 billion to 10 billion per unit Building nuclear plants is seen to be a risky business according to several notable credit rating agencies and investment analysts 

Nuclear accidents are often cited by anti nuclear groups as evidence of the inherent danger of nuclear power The most well known nuclear accident a mishandled safety test at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986 in Kiev Ukraine killed at least 4056 people and damaged almost 7 billion of property Radioactive fallout from the accident concentrated near Belarus Ukraine and Russia and at least 350000 people were forcibly resettled away from these areas After the accident traces of radioactive deposits unique to Chernobyl were found in nearly every country in the northern hemisphere Other serious nuclear accidents include the Mayak disaster Soviet submarine K 431 accident Soviet submarine K 19 accident Chalk River accidents Windscale fire Church Rock Uranium Mill Spill and the SL 1 accident 

Especially since the September 11 attacks people have become concerned that terrorists or criminals could bomb a nuclear plant and release radioactive material Building more plants would create more targets to protect

There is an international consensus that spent nuclear fuel should be stored in deep geological disposal sites However no country has opened such a site yet The demise of the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada leaves the USA with no plan for the long term storage of spent nuclear fuel

Anti nuclear groups generally claim that reliance on nuclear energy can be reduced by adopting energy conservation and energy efficiency measures Energy efficiency can reduce the consumption of energy while providing the same level of energy services

Anti nuclear groups also favour the use of renewable energy such as wind power solar power geothermal energy and biofuel According to the International Energy Agency renewable energy technologies are essential contributors to the energy supply portfolio as they contribute to world energy security and provide opportunities for mitigating greenhouse gases

Australia has no nuclear power stations and the current Gillard Labor government is opposed to nuclear power for Australia as are the Greens the party with the current balance of power in the upper house However Australia does have a small research reactor in Sydney and it does export uranium Australia has 40 of the worlds known uranium deposits as well as similar deposits of the other potential fission reactor fuel thorium and sells uranium to members of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty 

Uranium mining and export and nuclear issues have often been the subject of public debate and the anti nuclear movement in Australia has a long history It all began with the 197273 debate over French nuclear testing in the Pacific which involved several groups and the 197677 debate about uranium mining in Australia

In January 2008 the UK government announced plans to build new nuclear power stations and the anti nuclear movement in the United Kingdom has voiced concerns There are also public concerns about the proliferation of nuclear weapons Many different groups and individuals have been involved in demonstrations and protests over the years

For many years the anti nuclear movement in the United States succeeded in delaying or halting commitments to build some new nuclear plants Anti nuclear campaigns that captured national public attention in the 1970s involved the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant Diablo Canyon Power Plant Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant and the Three Mile Island accident  More recent targeted campaigning has related to the Indian Point Energy Center Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station Salem Nuclear Power Plant Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant Idaho National Laboratory proposed Yucca Mountain waste repository the Hanford Site the Nevada Test Site Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and transportation of nuclear waste from the Los Alamos National Laboratory Many different groups have been involved in various protests and demonstrations over the years

More than fifty anti nuclear groups are operating or have operated in the United States These include Abalone Alliance Clamshell Alliance Greenpeace USA Institute for Energy and Environmental Research Musicians United for Safe Energy Nevada Desert Experience Nuclear Control Institute Nuclear Information and Resource Service Public Citizen Energy Program Shad Alliance and the Sierra Club 

Many well known scientists and engineers have expressed reservations about nuclear power These people include Barry Commoner S David Freeman John Gofman Amory Lovins Arjun Makhijani Gregory Minor and Joseph Romm

George Washington Campbell was an American statesman He was elected to the United States House of Representatives as the Representative from Tennessees at large congressional district in 1803 He served in the House from 1805 1809 in the 8th 9th and 10th Congresses During the 10th Congress he was the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee He was also one of the managers appointed in 1804 to conduct the impeachment hearings for John Pickering judge of the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire and later in the same year the impeachment hearings against Samuel Chase Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States

Born in Scotland he immigrated to North Carolina in 1772 with his parents He graduated from the College of New Jersey in 1794 and began studying law He was admitted to the bar in North Carolina and began practicing in Knoxville Tennessee 

He left Congress in 1809 to become judge of the Tennessee Supreme Court serving until 1811

He served as a United States Senator from Tennessee twice once from 1811 to 1814 having been elected to fill the seat of Jenkin Whiteside and again from 1815 to 1818 His first service was from October 8 1811 to February 11 1814 when he resigned to accept appointment as the United States Secretary of the Treasury He returned to the Senate on October 10 1815 He served as the first chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and its predecessor from December 4 1815 until his resignation from the Senate on April 20 1818 on this occasion to accept appointment as United States Ambassador to Russia a position he held from 1818 1821 Campbell served as a member of the French Spoliation Claims Commission in 1831

Appointed Secretary of the Treasury by James Madison he faced national financial disorder brought on by the War of 1812 Congress had failed to recharter the First Bank of the United States after its charter expired in 1811 and appropriations for the war were unavailable so Campbell had to convince Americans to buy government bonds He was forced to meet to lenders terms selling government bonds at exorbitant interest rates In September 1814 the British occupied Washington DC and the credit of the government was lowered even further Campbell was unsuccessful in his efforts to raise money through additional bond sales and he resigned that October after only eight months in office disillusioned and in bad health

He died in 1848 and is buried at Nashville City Cemetery in Nashville Tennessee

Campbell County Tennessee is named in his honor

Samuel Chase was an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court and earlier was a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence as a representative of Maryland

Chloroform is a chemical substance It is an organic compound Chloroform is one of the intermediate substances that occur in the production of Polytetrafluoroethylene better known as Teflon 

The first who reported to have produced Chloroform was the French chemist Eugne Soubeiran in 1831 Soubeiran took acetone and ethanol and used bleach powder for the reaction The American physician Samuel Guthrie prepared gallons of the material and described its deliciousness of flavor Independently Justus von Liebig also described it Chloroform was named and chemically characterised in 1834 by Jean Baptiste Dumas

The main uses of Chloroform are

Chloroform was used as an anaesthetic during childbirth and surgery from about 1847 It replaced ether which was used before Chloroform is very poisonous and can cause breathing problems and problems with the heart Death from chloroform can come from cardiac arrest When Chloroform is stored for a longer time period it can decay into Phosgene Phosgene was a chemical weapon used during the First World War Chloroform can cause birth defects and lead to miscarriages It may cause cancer

In computing an arithmetic logic unit is a digital circuit that performs arithmetic and logical operations The ALU is one of basic building block of the central processing unit of a computer even the simplest microcontrollers contain one for purposes such as timing 

Now modern microprocessors microcontrollers and CPUs have very powerful and very complex ALUs also a CPU may contain up to more than 4 ALUs

Mathematician John von Neumann proposed the ALU concept in 1945

A floating point unit is a part of a computer system specially designed to carry out operations on floating point numbers Typical operations are addition subtraction multiplication division and square root 

Some systems can also perform more advanced functions as exponential or trigonometric functions calculations however in most modern processors these functions are done with software library routines not by hardware

In most modern general purpose CPUs one or more FPUs are integrated inside the CPU however many embedded microcontrollers especially older designs do not have hardware support for floating point operations 

In the past some systems as the Intel 8086 have implemented floating point via a coprocessor that is controlled by the CPU rather than as an integrated unit

Most modern computers have integrated FPU hardware but not all In the absence of an FPU many FPU functions can be emulated which saves the added hardware cost of an FPU but is significantly slower

Derealization is a change in the way someone views the world so that it seems unreal Derealization can also make someone feel as if their environment does not have emotion or depth This is a symptom of other problems such as sleeping disorders schizophrenia and other mental disorders It can also be caused by drug intoxication

Similar to derealization is depersonalization but the two are different Depersonalization is a sense of unreality about oneself Derealization is a sense of unreality of the outside world

Derealization often happens during a traumatic or tragic event

Paresthesia is a feeling of tingling prickling or numbness with no permanent effects It is commonly called pins and needles This feeling may last a short while or may be more long lasting A long term effect means there is something wrong with neurons in the body

An example of this can be felt when sitting cross legged for a long time and your foot falls asleep The tingling feeling you get when you move is paresthesia

Paresthesia has many known causes including the following

Perfectionism is the belief that one can and should be perfect A person who believes this is called a perfectionist Perfectionists believe that anything less than perfect is unacceptable While this can lead people to achieve great accomplishments and give people motivation it is considered to be a mostly unhealthy belief Perfectionism can lead to procrastination This can mean low productivity Perfectionism may also cause low self esteem and anxiety

In mathematics a group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with an operation The operation is used to combine two elements to form a third element There are a few rules the set and the operation must satisfy to qualify as a group These are called group axioms

One thing to note about groups is that it is not always the case that nowrap begina b b anowrap end for every a and b in the group If a group does have the property that nowrap begina b b anowrap end we call it an abelian group

The number of elements in a group is called its order 

One everyday example of a group is the set of integers and the addition operation It is easy to see that when you add two integers the result is always an integer So closure is true The identity element for this group is zero Because the order of additions does not matter associativity is true And the inverse of any integer is its negative value This group is also an abelian group It has infinite order because the integers are a countably infinite set

Detached Objectivity is a philosophical method for a person separating their own ideas and opinions from the observations they make Objective observations are true no matter who makes the observation Being objective helps people focus on things that everyone can agree on In science being objective means you study things by making some kind of measurement so your results are based on facts and not opinions

The opposite of objectivity is subjectivity

The flag of Australia is a national flag In 1901 Australia became a single country instead of six separate colonies A competition was held to design a new flag for the new country The winning flag has a blue background the Union Jack and six stars Five stars are in the shape of the constellation the Southern Cross the other is the Commonwealth Star The flag has been used from 1903 but did not become the official flag of Australia until 1953

On 29 April 1901 some private companies with the support of the Australian Government set up a competition to design a new flag for Australia The prize money was 200 including 75 from a magazine and 50 from a tobacco company There were 32823 designs entered into the competition These were put on show in Melbourne at the Royal Exhibition Building The judges from the army navy merchant navy and pilot service to choose the best flag were

The judges took eight days to choose a winning flag

Five flags were almost the same and they shared first prize The Prime Minister of Australia Edmund Barton announced the winners on 3 September 1901 The winners were

The winning flag was flown from the top of the Exhibition Building The Prime Minister Edmund Barton wrote to the Governor General to get approval from the King for the new flag This was officially announced on February 20 1903 

Some of the winning flags had different numbers of points on the stars of the Southern Cross This was simplified to seven points for the four largest stars and five for the small one The Commonwealth Star had six points for the six states This was the design in 1903 In 1912 an extra point was added to the Commonwealth Star for the Territories of Australia 

In 1934 the government published how the Australian flag should be made The flag of the United Kingdom the Union Jack was still the official flag in Australia until 1954 By law only the Australian government was allowed to fly the blue Australian flag Everyone else that wanted to use an Australian flag used the red one called the Red Ensign In 15 March 1941 the Prime Minister of Australia Robert Menzies gave permission for the blue flag to be used on public buildings schools and by the public Australian ships would use the Red Ensign

In 1954 the Australian Flag became the official Australian National Flag The Australian flag is the most important flag flown in Australia and must be given more importance than flags from other countries When it is raised or lowered people should face the flag and not talk It should only be used properly for example it can not be used to cover a table or a seat and it can not be allowed to touch the ground

The Royal Australian Navy has had its own flag from 1 March 1967 This looks like the national flag but has a white background with blue stars called the Australian White Ensign The Royal Australian Air Force got its own flag in 1949 This was changed in 1981 to feature a red kangaroo

The Queen of Australia has her own flag for use when she visits Australia The Governor General of Australia also has a flag which is flown from his or her official house and from his or her car

The United States presidential election of 2000 was a contest between Democratic candidate Al Gore then Vice President and Republican candidate George W Bush then governor of Texas and son of former president George H W Bush Bill Clinton the incumbent President had been in office for two terms the most allowed by the Twenty second Amendment Bush narrowly won the November 7 election with 271 electoral votes to Gores 266 There was a disagreement over who won Floridas 25 electoral votes the recount that happened there and the uncommon event that the winner got fewer popular votes than the loser

The United States presidential election of 2004 was held on Tuesday November 2 2004 to elect the President of the United States It was the 55th consecutive quadrennial election for President and Vice President Republican Party candidate and the current President George W Bush won against Democratic Party candidate John Kerry the junior US Senator from Massachusetts Foreign policy was the biggest issue during the election campaign as well as how Bush handled the War on Terrorism and the 2003 invasion of Iraq 

As in the previous election there were concerns about voting and concerns of irregularities emerged during and after the vote The winner was not determined until the following day when Kerry decided not to dispute Bushs win in the state of Ohio The state held enough electoral votes to determine the winner of the presidency Both Kerry and Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean have stated their opinion that voting in Ohio did not proceed fairly and that had it done so the Democratic ticket might have won that state and therefore the election 

Only three states changed allegiance New Mexico and Iowa voted Democratic in 2000 but voted Republican in 2004 New Hampshire voted Republican in 2000 but voted Democratic in 2004 In the Electoral College Bush received 286 votes and Kerry 252

In computer engineering register renaming refers to a technique used to avoid unnecessary serialized execution of program instructions because of the reuse of the same registers by those instructions

Programs are composed of instructions which operate on values The instructions must name these values in order to distinguish them from one another A typical instruction might say add X and Y and put the result in Z In this instruction X Y and Z are the names of storage locations

In order to have a compact instruction encoding most processor instruction sets have a small set of special locations which can be directly named For example the x86 instruction set architecture has 8 integer registers x86 64 has 16 many RISCs have 32 and IA 64 has 128 In smaller processors the names of these locations correspond directly to elements of a register file

Different instructions may take different amounts of time For instance a processor may be able to execute hundreds of instructions while a single load from main memory instruction is in progress Shorter instructions executed while the load is outstanding will finish first thus the instructions are finishing out of the original program order Out of order execution has been used in most recent high performance CPUs to achieve some of their speed gains

Consider this sequance of instructions running on an out of order CPU

 1LOAD R1 LOC MEM1024 2R1 R1 2 3STORE R1 LOC MEM10248 4LOAD R1 LOC MEM2048 5R1 R1 4 6STORE R1 LOC MEM20488 

Instructions 4 5 and 6 are independent of instructions 1 2 and 3 but the processor cannot finish 4 until 3 is done because 3 would then write the wrong value

We can remove this restriction by changing the names of some of the registers

 1LOAD R1 LOC MEM1024 2R1 R1 2 3STORE R1 LOC MEM10248 4LOAD R2 LOC MEM2048 5R2 R2 4 6STORE R2 LOC MEM20488 

Now instructions 4 5 and 6 can be executed in parallel with instructions 1 2 and 3 so that the program can be executed faster

When possible compilers do this renaming But compilers are limited by the number of register inside the CPU Many high performance CPUs have more physical registers than may be named directly in the instruction set and they can rename registers in hardware to achieve better instruction level parallelism

Anything that is read and written can be renamed While the general purpose and floating point registers are the most flag and status registers or even individual status bits are commonly renamed as well

Memory locations can also be renamed although it is not commonly done to the level used in register renaming

When more than one instruction references a particular location for an operand either reading it or writing it executing those instructions in an order different from the original program order can cause to three kinds of problems also known as hazards

The formation and evolution of the Solar System is the name for the many ideas describing how the Solar System began and how it will carry on changing The accepted idea is that 46 billion years ago there was a very big cloud of gas in our area of space known as a nebula The Nebula eventually became so big that gravity pulled all the gas to the center Eventually because of all the gas it became so hot there that some hydrogen atoms fused together to make helium 

Scientists think that solar systems are created out of a huge cloud of gas The process by which the solar systems are created is called the Nebular Theory

As they did this a lot of energy was let out All this energy eventually made our star the Sun The leftover gas created the Gas Giants also known as Jovian Planets The rock and dust went off to make the Rocky or Terrestrial planets their moons asteroids and all other objects in the Solar System

Because of the suns huge mass it had very strong gravity that caused all of the surrounding celestial objects to stay in place an orbit around the sun

The solar system was now formed

In computer engineering microarchitecture is a description of the electrical circuitry of a computer central processing unit or digital signal processor that is sufficient for completely describing the operation of the hardware 

In academic circles the term computer organization is used while in the computer industry the term microarchitecture is more often used Microarchitecture and instruction set architecture together constitute the field of computer architecture

Since the 1950s many computers used microprogramming to implement their control logic which decoded the program instructions and executed them The bits inside the microprogram words controlled the processor at the level of electrical signals

The term microarchitecture was used to describe the units that were controlled by the microprogram words in contrast to the term architecture that was visible and documented for programmers While architecture usually had to be compatible between hardware generations the underlying microarchitecture could be easily changed

The microarchitecture is related to but not the same as the instruction set architecture The instruction set architecture is near to the programming model of a processor as seen by an assembly language programmer or compiler writer which includes the execution model processor registers address and data formats etc The microarchitecture is mainly a lower level structure and therefore manage a large number of details that are hidden in the programming model It describes the inside parts of the processor and how they work together in order to implement the architectural specification 

Microarchitectual elements may be everything from single logic gates to registers lookup tables multiplexers counters etc to complete ALUs FPUs and even larger elements The electronic circuitry level can in turn be subdivided into transistor level details such as which basic gate building structures are used and what logic implementation types are chosen in addition to the actual logic design used built them

A few important points

A very simplified high level description common in marketing may show only fairly basic characteristics such as bus widths along with various types of execution units and other large systems such as branch prediction and cache memories pictured as simple blocks perhaps with some important attributes or characteristics noted Some details regarding pipeline structure may sometimes also be included

The pipelined datapath is the most commonly used datapath design in microarchitecture today This technique is used in most modern microprocessors microcontrollers and DSPs The pipelined architecture allows multiple instructions to overlap in execution much like an assembly line The pipeline includes several different stages which are fundamental in microarchitecture designs Some of these stages include instruction fetch instruction decode execute and write back Some architectures include other stages such as memory access The design of pipelines is one of the central microarchitectural tasks 

Execution units are also essential to microarchitecture Execution units include arithmetic logic units floating point units loadstore units branch prediction and SIMD These units perform the operations or calculations of the processor The choice of the number of execution units their latency and throughput is a central microarchitectural design task The size latency throughput and connectivity of memories within the system are also microarchitectural decisions 

System level design decisions such as whether or not to include peripherals such as memory controllers can be considered part of the microarchitectural design process This includes decisions on the performance level and connectivity of these peripherals 

Unlike architectural design where achieving a specific performance level is the main goal microarchitectural design pays closer attention to other constraints Since microarchitecture design decisions directly affect what goes into a system attention must be paid to such issues as

In general all CPUs single chip microprocessors or multi chip implementations run programs by performing the following steps

Complicating this simple looking series of steps is the fact that the memory hierarchy which includes caching main memory and non volatile storage like hard disks has always been slower than the processor itself Step often introduces a delay while the data arrives over the computer bus A big amount of research has been put into designs that avoid these delays as much as possible Over the years a central design goal was to execute more instructions in parallel thus increasing the effective execution speed of a program These efforts introduced complicated logic and circuit structures In the past such techniques could only be implemented on expensive mainframes or supercomputers due to the amount of circuitry needed for these techniques As semiconductor manufacturing progressed more and more of these techniques could be implemented on a single semiconductor chip

What follows is a survey of micro architectural techniques that are common in modern CPUs 

The choice of which Instruction Set Architecture to use greatly affects the complexity of implementing high performance devices Over the years computer designers did their best to simplify instruction sets in order to enable higher performance implementations by saving designers effort and time for features which improve performance rather than wasting them on the complexity of instruction set 

Instruction set design has progressed from CISC RISC VLIW EPIC types Architectures that are dealing with data parallelism include SIMD and Vectors

One of the first and most powerful techniques to improve performance is the use of the instruction pipeline Early processor designs performed all of the steps above on one instruction before moving onto the next Large portions of the processor circuitry were left idle at any one step for instance the instruction decoding circuitry would be idle during execution and so on

Pipelines improve performance by allowing a number of instructions to work their way through the processor at the same time In the same basic example the processor would start to decode a new instruction while the last one was waiting for results This would allow up to four instructions to be in flight at one time making the processor look four times as fast Although any one instruction takes just as long to complete the CPU as a whole retires instructions much faster and can be run at a much higher clock speed

Improvements in chip manufacturing allowed more circuitry to be placed on the same chip and designers started looking for ways to use it One of the most common ways was to add an ever increasing amount of cache memory on chip Cache is a very fast memory memory that can be accessed in a few cycles as compared to what is needed to talk to main memory The CPU includes a cache controller which automates reading and writing from the cache if the data is already in the cache it simply appears whereas if it is not the processor is stalled while the cache controller reads it in

RISC designs started adding cache in the mid to late 1980s often only 4 KB in total This number grew over time and typical CPUs now have about 512 KB while more powerful CPUs come with 1 or 2 or even 4 6 8 or 12 MB organized in multiple levels of a memory hierarchy Generally speaking more cache means more speed

Caches and pipelines were a perfect match for each other Previously it didnt make much sense to build a pipeline that could run faster than the access latency of off chip cash memory Using on chip cache memory instead meant that a pipeline could run at the speed of the cache access latency a much smaller length of time This allowed the operating frequencies of processors to increase at a much faster rate than that of off chip memory

Pipeline stalls and flushes due to branches are the two main things preventing achieving higher performance through instruction level parallelism The from time that the processors instruction decoder has found that it has encountered a conditional branch instruction to the time that the deciding jumping register value can be read out the pipeline might be stalled for several cycles On average every fifth instruction executed is a branch so thats a high amount of stalling If the branch is taken its even worse as then all of the subsequent instructions which were in the pipeline needs to be flushed 

Techniques such as branch prediction and speculative execution are used to reduce these branch penalties Branch prediction is where the hardware makes educated guesses on whether a particular branch will be taken The guess allows the hardware to prefetch instructions without waiting for the register read Speculative execution is a further enhancement in which the code along the predicted path is executed before it is known whether the branch should be taken or not

The addition of caches reduces the frequency or duration of stalls due to waiting for data to be fetched from the main memory hierarchy but does not get rid of these stalls entirely In early designs a cache miss would force the cache controller to stall the processor and wait Of course there may be some other instruction in the program whose data is available in the cache at that point Out of order execution allows that ready instruction to be processed while an older instruction waits on the cache then re orders the results to make it appear that everything happened in the programmed order

Even with all of the added complexity and gates needed to support the concepts outlined above improvements in semiconductor manufacturing soon allowed even more logic gates to be used 

In the outline above the processor processes parts of a single instruction at a time Computer programs could be executed faster if multiple instructions were processed simultaneously This is what superscalar processors achieve by replicating functional units such as ALUs The replication of functional units was only made possible when the integrated circuit area of a single issue processor no longer stretched the limits of what could be reliably manufactured By the late 1980s superscalar designs started to enter the market place 

In modern designs it is common to find two load units one store two or more integer math units two or more floating point units and often a SIMD unit of some sort The instruction issue logic grows in complexity by reading in a huge list of instructions from memory and handing them off to the different execution units that are idle at that point The results are then collected and re ordered at the end

Register renaming refers to a technique used to avoid unnecessary serialized execution of program instructions because of the reuse of the same registers by those instructions Suppose we have to groups of instruction that will use the same register one set of instruction is executed first to leave the register to the other set but if the other set is assigned to a different similar register both sets of instructions can be executed in parallel

Due to the growing gap between CPU operating frequencies and DRAM access times none of the techniques that enhance instruction level parallelism within one program could overcome the long stalls that occurred when data had to be fetched from main memory Additionally the large transistor counts and high operating frequencies needed for the more advanced ILP techniques required power dissipation levels that could no longer be cheaply cooled For these reasons newer generations of computers have started to utilize higher levels of parallelism that exist outside of a single program or program thread

This trend is sometimes known as throughput computing This idea originated in the mainframe market where online transaction processing emphasized not just the execution speed of one transaction but the capacity to deal with big numbers of transactions at the same time With transaction based applications such as network routing and web site serving greatly increasing in the last decade the computer industry has re emphasized capacity and throughput issues

One technique of how this parallelism is achieved is through multiprocessing systems computer systems with multiple CPUs In the past this was reserved for high end mainframes but now small scale multiprocessors servers have become commonplace for the small business market For large corporations large scale multiprocessors are common Even personal computers with multiple CPUs have appeared since the 1990s

Advances in semiconductor technology reduced transistor size multicore CPUs have appeared where multiple CPUs are implemented on the same silicon chip Initially used in chips targeting embedded markets where simpler and smaller CPUs would allow multiple instantiations to fit on one piece of silicon By 2005 semiconductor technology allowed dual high end desktop CPUs CMP chips to be manufactured in volume Some designs such as UltraSPARC T1 used a simpler designs in order to fit more processors on one piece of silicon

Recently another technique that has become more popular is multithreading In multithreading when the processor has to fetch data from slow system memory instead of stalling for the data to arrive the processor switches to another program or program thread which is ready to execute Though this does not speed up a particular programthread it increases the overall system throughput by reducing the time the CPU is idle

Conceptually multithreading is equivalent to a context switch at the operating system level The difference is that a multithreaded CPU can do a thread switch in one CPU cycle instead of the hundreds or thousands of CPU cycles a context switch normally requires This is achieved by replicating the state hardware for each active thread

A further enhancement is simultaneous multithreading This technique allows superscalar CPUs to execute instructions from different programsthreads simultaneously in the same cycle

Southampton Corporation Tramways was a transport company that opened in 1879 and closed in 1949 At first the trams were horse drawn but later they were powered by electricity

Southampton a city of the United Kingdom located in Hampshire was becoming bigger in the nineteenth century The population was 27000 people in 1841 This was because the docks were becoming much more used Also a railway openened in 1839 and a horse drawn omnibus service started at as well By 1843 a regular service was running from the station to Millbrook Eling Bitterne Shirley Portswood Totton and Romsey Because of this by 1861 the population had become 42000

By 1872 tramways were a lot more popular The British and Foreign Tramway Company contacted Southampton Corporation with an idea to set up a tramway in the town Lots of people were against the idea The Corporation did not allow tram tracks to be put in the High Street and Above Bar The British and Foreign Tramway Company stopped thinking about the idea

In 1876 Southampton Corporation saw that their public transport was not as good as the public transport in other cities The Southampton Tramways Company was made to build a new tramway system The tramway started to be built in the summer of 1878

The first tram ran on 5 May 1879 The tramway made 26 Many people did not want the trams to run on a Sunday and 3500 people put their names on a petition to stop the trams running on a Sunday The companys manager said that there were lots of people who rode on the trams on Sunday and that the service would continue If the service made money on a Sunday then the trams would keep running The first tram route that opened was Stag Gate  Holy Rood A second route opened on 6 May 1879 which was Alma Road  Canute Road  Oxford Street  High Street  Floating Dock and Stag Gates  Lodge Road  Portswood The Tramway Junction  Commercial Road  Shirley route opened on 9 June 1879

The company got into some trouble soon after it opened One of the managers ran away with some money to America in 1881 Another manager got the sack in 1882 because there was a problem with the companys money By 1887 though the company had recovered It had a good financial base to stand on and it was paying divedends of 8 a year to its shareholders On the 22 October 1889 the Portswood route ran via Spear Road and Avenue Road Fares cost less money in 1896 because they changed from 3d to 2d for through routes The tram times became two times as fast to every 5 minutes from Stag Gates to Holy Rood Four new trams and forty horses were needed to run this service

The Southampton Tramway Company was bought by Southampton Corporation on 30 June 1898 for 51000

The tramway had twenty three tramcars when it was bought in 1898 They were

Southampton Corporation bought the Southampton Electric Light and Power Company in 1896 Two years later in 1898 it bought the Southampton Tramway Company two years later in 1898 This allowed them to change the towns tramway system to electricity instead of horse power In 1899 a group of people from the Corporation visited tram systems in Bradford Dover Glasgow Liverpool and London for ideas They decided that Southamptons was going to be based on Liverpools The first electric tram route from Junction to Shirley opened on 22 January 1900 The second route from Stag Gates to Holy Road via Prospect Place opened on 29 May 1900 Over the next 3 years the system slowly got bigger The following routes opened

The last route to open as part of the first stage of the electrified system was Portswood  Hampton Park on 25 July 1903

Before World War One more routes were added

After the war more new routes were added

After thiese additions the system was at its biggest The only new lines opened after this were to miss out the Bargate Arch in Southampton The east side opened on 24 April 1932 and the west side on 5 June 1938 

Before World War 2 two routes were also closed Roberts Road  Millbrook closed on 2 October 1935 except for workmens services It did however re open whilst the war was happening The second route to close was Clock Tower  Northam Bridge which closed on 4 June 1926

When the electrified system opened it needed some new tramcars to replace the horse drawn ones The first trams used on the system were built by G F Milnes Co Birkenhead They had open upper deck had back to back knifeboard seats so that they could fit under Bargate arch No2 was changed into a toastrack car in 1916 It was sold to Portsmouth in 1919 where it became Number 104 In 1903 twelve trams were built by Hurst Nelson Co The trams originally had three windows on each side on the bottom deck This was later chnged to have four windows on each side because the original design did not give enough support for the top deck Two bogie trams were ordered in 1910 This order was later cancelled The system also bought six ex London County Council Tramways cars with enclosed upper decks These were numbered 75 80 A final sixteen trams were bought in 1918 As well as these a number of trams were built by the tramway

Before 1932 the only road route between Southampton High Street and Above Bar was through the arch in the centre of the Bargate In 1923 a new design of enclosed double deck tram was built by PJ Baker General Manager of the tramways It had a rounded top that would fit through the arch These trams had smaller wheels to help reduce the trams height They were driven by high speed motors which produced more torque However the roadway through the arch in the Bargate still had to be lowered to allow the trams to pass through the arch Some secret changing of the profile of the archs masonry was also needed at the last minute Trams started to pass around the East of the Bargate on 24 April 1932 The last tram to pass through the central archway did so on 4 June 1938 By this time part of Southampton ancient walls had been demolished so that the Bargate was passable on both sides

Southampton Tramways were mainly affected by staffing issues during World War I To try and stop this women were allowed to become conductorettes Because of this toastrack tram No2 had a gangway cut through the middle of it In the early years of the war a tram went round Southampton for two hours twice a week It had a military band playing on the top deck This was an effort to try and boost recruitment

World War II affected Southampton much more than World War One Women were again employed by the company Unlike in World War I though they were allowed to drive the trams this time

Car No31 was destroyed by an incendiary bomb on 30 November 1940 It was the only tram to be destroyed during the war To save the fleet of trams from the intensive bombing of Southampton during World War II they were painted grey Regular services stopped at 7pm and they were parked up overnight in Cemetery Road on Southampton Common for the same reason

In November 1942 a tram was accidentally set in motion whilst parked up overnight It took two other trams with it The unmanned convoy of trams was stopped by a lorry before anybody was hurt The incident caused some worry locally because it was thought that saboteurs were responsible It later emerged that the incident was due to a young boy playing on the trams

The trams in Southampton made good profits for Southampton Corporation However the Corporation had not put those profits back into the tram system Because of this the whole system needed modernisation by the end of the Second World War This included the trams the power supply and the track

It was decided that buses were a better alternative to modernising the trams The tramway system therefore closed The first line to close was Bitterne Park  St Marys  Docks on 15 May 1948 Swaythling  Portswood  Lodge Road  Stag Gates closed on 30 October 1948 Swaythling  Burgess Road  Bassett Crossroads  Avenue Junction closed on 5 March 1949 Floating Bridge  Shirley Holy Rood  High Street  Royal Pier and Roberts Road  Millbrook all closed on 31 December 1949 The last movement of a tram in Southampton was on 4 February 1950 when cars No21 and No101 were moved from Shirley depot to Portswood depot under their own power After the system closed some trams were sold to Leeds The majority though were sent to A F Harriss scrapyard at Bevois Valley for scrapping A few were sold on from there to be used as sheds or summer houses This allowed some trams to be preserved

Three Southampton trams have survived

Uttoxeter is a small market town and civil parish in East Staffordshire Staffordshire England The current population is 12023 This number is expected to grow when new developments in the town will have finished Uttoxeter is close to the River Dove It is near the cities of Stoke on Trent Derby and Lichfield It is twinned with Raisdorf in Germany and Fumel in France

The European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo also called EULEX Kosovo is a contract between the European Union and Kosovo With this certain states of the European Union will send police forces as well as lawyers to help make Kosovo more secure This is what was agreed by the Ahtisaari plan The idea is to continue the presence of foreign police forces to help the police in Kosovo as planned under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 Russia and Serbia see this mission as illegal The plan is to have 2000 police force and lawyers on the ground The mission started to deploy its forces on 16 February 2008 Currently only 400 of the some 1900 police officers and judges foreseen by the EULEX mission are in place

The European Council agreed on sending 1800 to 1900 people on 14 December 2007 Because of the unstable political climate this force was later increased to 2000 people This was mainly done because it was impossible to reach an agreement with Serbia The force is made up mainly of police officers Some of the officers have received training how to control rioting crowds Some people of the force are prosecutors and judges Because the force is so big there will soon be the most EU civil servants doing their job there rather than in Brussels Chief of the mission is Yves de Kermabon who is accountable to the European Union Special Representative in Kosovo Pieter Feith The mission is expected to cost 165 million in its first year

The final decision on the mission was planned to be taken on 28 January 2008 This was postponed due to concerns over possible negative effects on the second round of the presidential election in Serbia on 3 February 2008 and the possible signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia on that date The officially voiced reason for the postponement is the lack of a legal basis for the mission A Joint Action was approved on 4 February 2008 meaning that only the final approval is required it is expected to be given on 18 February 2008

There are still questions on how this mission should replace the UN administration in Kosovo Until these are answered Spain will not take part in the mission Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel ngel Moratinos told a meeting of European Union Foreign Ministers that Spain will not send its contingent to the EULEX mission until there has been a formal transfer of powers from the United Nations

Apart from EU members third parties Croatia Turkey Switzerland Norway and the United States will also take part

The countries of the European Union are currently divided Some recognise Kosovo others do not The current Presidency of the European Council said that countries could send people to take part in the mission even without recognising Kosovo as an independent state

According to the EU the mission will be based on United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 This resolution introduced international rule in Kosovo in 1999 The EU force has so far not received a new UN Security Council directive because Russia opposed it Russia blocked the transfer of the UN mission to the EU According to Serbia the mission implies that the EU recognises Kosovo as an independent state

Beige is a very pale yellowish cream color 

The name comes from beige cloth a woolen fabric left in its natural color It then came to be used for a range of light tints of yellow chosen for their neutral or pale warm colored appearance 

In the 1920s the meaning of the term beige expanded to the point where it is now also used for not only for pale yellows but also for a wide range of pale brown shades

The first recorded use of beige as a color name in English was in 1887

A digital signal processor is a specialized microprocessor designed specifically for digital signal processing generally used in real time computing

Digital signal processing algorithms require a large number of mathematical operations to be performed quickly on a set of data Signals are converted from analog to digital manipulated digitally and then converted again to form digital to analog as shown in the diagram Many digital signal processing applications have real time constraints that is for the system to work the DSP operation must be completed within some time constraint

The microarchitecture of a digital signal processor is optimized specifically for digital signal processing applications

Lies for the Liars is a full length album released in 2007 by The Used

Smother Me ends at 420 but runs to 617 due to the addition of a hidden track titled Queso Queso is a 30 second song that is about a quesadilla Though it was first released on The Useds MySpace in late 2006 most fans talked about it on message boards and thought of it as a joke  it was not expected to actually be on the album

Lies for the Liars contains emotive heartfelt and sometimes sarcastic or Gothic lyrics It has more swearing than previous The Used albums but this is used on fewer songs For example Liar Liar swears 10 times

The first song The Ripper has an ending that makes the CD appear to be stuck but its only part of the song

If Only You Were Lonely is the second album released by Hawthorne Heights Many listeners consider the album more on the dark side than the first Hawthorne Heights albumfactdateApril 2009

The album includes a few songs where death growls are absent and others where it is only used in a small part of the song to make it fit better Previously they would use these harsh vocals a lot more

It brought singles such as This is Who We Are and something new for the band with songs like Decembers 

Digital signal processing is concerned with the processing of digital signals or analog signals after converting from analog to digital format DSP includes subfields like communication signals processing radar signal processing sensor array processing digital image processing etc 

DSP is usually used with real world analog signals found in our lives the first step is usually to convert the signal from an analog to a digital form by using an analog to digital converter Often the required output signal is another real world analog signal which requires a digital to analog converter

Digital signal processing algorithms can run on

Ava Futebol Clube or Ava as they are usually called is a Brazilian football team from Florianpolis in Santa Catarina founded on September 1 1923 It became nationally known after the tennis player Gustavo Kuerten declared to be a supporter of Ava Home stadium is the Ressacada stadium capacity 19000 They play in blue shirts shorts and socks

The club was founded after a businessman called Amadeu Horn gave football kits to a group of boys These boys played a match against a team called Humait and won On September 1 1923 at Amadeu Horns house the club was founded being called at that time Avahy Foot ball Club The team was named Avahy after the Battle of Avahy in the Paraguayan War In the following year it became the first Santa Catarina State Championship champion

Ava played the Brazilian First Division four times in 1974 1976 1977 and 1979 In 1998 it won its only national title the Brazilian Third Division Since 1999 it plays the Srie B and the best campaigns happened in 2001 and 2004 when Ava reached the Final Four but could not be promoted to the First Division Ava is the club with more titles won in the Santa Catarina State Championship in the 20th century

Avas stadium is Estdio da Ressacada inaugurated in 1983 with a maximum capacity of 19000 people

Avas greatest rival is Figueirense FC

The Estdio Aderbal Ramos da Silva usually called Estdio da Ressacada or just Ressacada is a football stadium inaugurated on November 15 1983 in Carianos neighborhood Florianpolis Santa Catarina Brazil with a maximum capacity of approximately 19000 people The stadium is owned by Ava Its formal name honors Aderbal Ramos da Silva who was president of the Santa Catarina Football Federation and was also governor of the state

Several matches of the Brazilian football team as well as the Brazilian football olympic team were played at Ressacada stadium

This stadium should not be confused with Blumenaus stadium which is also called Estdio Aderbal Ramos da Silva however it is nicknamed DEBA and has a maximum capacity of 4000 people

In 1982 to replace the old Estdio Adolfo Konder Ava bought a groundplot close to the citys airport The construction works were led by Cairo Bueno and the stadium was designed by the architect Davi Ferreira Lima

The inaugural match was played on November 15 1983 when Vasco da Gama beat Ava 6 1 The first goal of the stadium was scored by Vasco da Gamas Wilson Tadei

On May 31 1986 the stadium lights were inaugurated

The stadiums attendance record currently stands at 19000 set on July 17 1988 when Ava beat Blumenau 2 0 for the Campeonato Catarinense final

The Opel Sintra is an Large MPV produced by the German automaker Opel from 1996 to 2000 The Sintra is branded as Opel in Europe South Africa China Singapore Japan Taiwan Vauxhall in Great Britain Holden in Australia and in New Zealand and Chevrolet in Latin America Thailand Indonesia Philippines depending on the market

The reason for the Sintra to end production was because EuroNCAP tested a 1998 model and found it only scored 25 Stars forcing Opel to drop the model in 1999 Because the Astra Based Zafira MPV debuted when the Sintra finished production in 1999 sometimes it is said that the Zafira replaced the Sintrabut actually Opel never had another Large MPV after the Sintra and then eventually Opel abandoned the Large MPV style in Europe

Opel Zafira is a car produced by the german carmaker Opel since 1999 and is branded as Vauxhall in Great Britain It currently in its third generation

The Zafira is sometimes said to be the replacement of the Sintra because it was introduced roughly around the same time it was discontinued Also they were both minivans However the Zafira was in a different segment and Opel had not intended this

Poison dart frog is the common name of a group of frogs in the family Dendrobatidae They are native to Central and South America 

Unlike most frogs these are active during the day They often have brightly coloured bodies which act as warning colouration Although all dendrobatids are at least somewhat toxic in the wild levels of toxicity vary greatly from one species to the next and from one population to another Many species are critically endangered Blue poison dart frogs are poisonous because they eat ants and other small insects that have toxins in their bodies If an animal eats the frog it will become very sick

Hi all I would like to request either indefinite full move protection for tlGeobox River or something else like that as well as indefinite semifull protection for all components of the Geobox series of templates These templates are all uniquely tuned to make all the Geobox templates work correctly and if any vandal were to move any of these pages or change any part of them it could cause drastic errors throughout many thousands of articles on this site While I am not demanding it I would like to note that this is somewhat important as these templates are very vulnerable right now Cheers Razorflame 2251 10 October 2008

It appears that this user learned little from his recent one year ban This week Jonas has chosen to butt in after I answered a personal attack from Berserkerus concerning the graphic used on Amplitude modulation and Frequency modulation Jonas has accused me of biting a newcomer and thinks he needs to explain to me again and again the purposes and guidelines to this wiki Meanwhile he accuses me of rudeness and of ageism while he in turn makes backhanded and overt insults talks down to me calls me an anonymous expert etc and does essentially the same things he has accused me of

Berserkerus has a history on Russian Wikipedia so I am sure he is no stranger to Wikipedia norms and expectations Berserkeruss attack on me was unwarranted I did not create the graphic he chose to replace and he should have directed his words to the person who created it if he is so convinced the original graphic is non sense and a lie as he insisted on my talk page To my experience his graphic is inferior to the one that was replaced and his comments belong on the graphics talk page not my personal talk page

For the record I am a graduate of a broadcasting school as well as college I worked in radio I have worked with oscilloscopes and their virtual equivalents My sources are my years of schooling and job experience not all of it came through textbooks Not all of it is documentable Meanwhile I notice neither Berserkerus nor Jonas have provided documented sources such as the latter has demanded from me Call it OR if you want to but facts are facts and Im pretty sure neither my profs nor my eyes lied to me in those years

I advised Jonas politely after his first message to me that he would do better to let others handle the situation considering both his history and the fact that he is not an admin He chose instead to go on the attack and continues to do so I believe that to let this matter lie would only encourage him to develop an even worse attitude than he already shows I would set my education my life experience and my edit history against his anytime and I suspect the reason he has come on so strongly toward me is that I turned down an invitation to join a separate wiki he created last year 

This matter drew the attention of RTG who chose to award me a Vandalism Barnstar on the grounds that I dont understand what vandalism is and confused him Forgive me I saw a good graphic replaced with a poor one and where I come from a berserker is someone out to cause trouble andor indulge in carelessness I used the automated setup to revert the graphic and send a notice vandalism was the closest default to what I saw in the situation  I do not need this hassle from any of the parties mentioned particularly from less authoritative less experienced persons

I do not have a problem with this boys age in itself I presently work as a teacher and if a student knows something I dont on a topic I invite them to speak up and to correct me if necessary and I make sure their classmates hear the correction My problem is with the attitude I continue to see coming from him which to me is little different from the kind that gets a student sent to the office

Sharing what I know and have learned in a forum such as this should be a pleasure Situations like this make it a chore and a waste of time not just for myself Im sure Since Jonas doesnt want to hear about it from me I would appreciate an admin stepping in at this time Zephyrad 1941 26 October 2008

I have no problem with expertise However this is a subject many have worked on and if this is true it has to have been documented somewhere You had to learn this somewhere it was not just a voice of wisdom that whispered to you I am not saying someone had to teach you but you had to have seen this before Now that youve claimed expertise made a contentious edit about the subject and refused to give sources please identify yourself according to UserJonas D RandTransparency on your user page I have no intention of stressing you out Zephyrad However I wasnt being ageistic and if you considered what I did rude you need to realize that when you do something questionable and are called upon it the proper thing to do would be to 1 cite some source 2 provide your real name and qualifications andor 3 admit that it was all a lie and leave Do not report me and accuse me of hypocrisy and put emphasis on my one year block

Whether I am an admin an adult or a previously blocked editor is irrelevant Quit being fallacious and trying to deflect attention to the real issue which is your anonymous claims of expert knowledge As for accusing Gwib and FSM of sockpuppetry I raised the possibility of the latter after Creol made a dramafest out of it and I had a small suspicion that the former used MindTheGap to troll about Benniguy but I realized that it was stupid I never accused him of sockpuppetry Jonas 2047 26 October 2008

Im pretty sure a weeks passed Jonas hasnt been assigned a mentor He has got another warning this time for posting IRC logs I therefore propose I WPBB and mentor Jonas However I would like to have a admin co mentor in case I need to block Im thinking Gwib Majorly or Creol If anyone is interested can they please post here or on my talk page

I will do a draft mentoring plan in my Userspace based off my Mentoring plan from ENWP   Da Punk 95 talk 2129 3 November 2008

Sorry Creol I should have relized he never liked you Shapiros10  yeah Im happy to have you as a backup Gwib  might be best if your co mentor   Da Punk 95 talk 0030 4 November 2008

Hello the mentoring plan proposed by Da Punk 95 looks good I accept the mentorship and Shapiros10 and Gwib being experienced in English Wikipedia and Simple English Wikipedia respectively would be good mentors I am however curious about one point does Wikipedia space include this or Simple Talk I think that may be a bit excessive because I cannot offer any solutions to the community or give my two cents in a community discussion What is the purpose for this rule Jonas 0356 4 November 2008

I will start adding notices to your userspace now However I need you to make one edit At the mentoring plan now located at UserJonas D RandMentoring there is now a section marked Aprroval Please read that section and say that you agree to that   Da Punk 95 talk 0420 4 November 2008

I would like to have the rollback flag added please I Understand what vandalism is and when to revert it Hopefully my resent Reverts prove this Thanks Daisy 1546 8 December 2008

Tholly brings up a point about need for rollback There probably should be some basic criteria needed for granting rollback This does not need to be very strict say 2 3 weeks active 50 edits minimum did some vandalism removal prior experience a plus We should at least have some idea they would use it before we give it to them Basically check the contributions for the account does the next 50 link show up got some summaries that say you reverted vandalism Good to go on criteria   Creol 1915 3 November 2008

Outstanding request here Thanks SwirlBoy39 1525 1 November 2008

I just had a chat regarding Ric that did not involve him I considered it quite rude that it was set up where anyone could attack Ric and indeed people did and he had no opportunity to defend himself This is a violation of proper decorum and basic dignity The log was here UserJonas D RandStaticFalcon before it was censored by Gwib as an attack page because he didnt want to show the truth Why else Jonas 2037 2 November 2008

I did not know it violated Policy either I thought that it was OK Under this rule UserMicrochip08 should be banned for posting those IRC logs unless Upperclassman and SwirlBoy gave permission to do so And no I havent been banned from the channel as far as I know of I have been banned from wikipedia en and wikipedia That log was from wikipedia simple Unless someone banned me in the past 35 minutes which surely is possible I havent been banned from there yet 

Plus regardless of policy I felt I had a moral obligation to publish that as it was an attack on someone who was not even present Apparently though ethics is second to policy on Freenode Jonas 2057 2 November 2008

OK Jonas has now approved Mentoring Please be aware he is not do to the following

If he does he is to be blocked for 48 hours on sight and it logged at his Mentoring subpage Mentors are Gwib Sharkpedos10 and Myself   Da Punk 95 talk 0441 4 November 2008

I have unblocked as it was a good faith block but a bad mentoring plan The block was designed to be punitive and not preventative We should hold a community discussion for mentoring where we agree on a desired result in accordance with his history Synergy 0001 5 November 2008

Fine In consensus with community consensus I relinquish my power as mentor   Da Punk 95 talk 0240 6 November 2008

Ok i debated for ages as to whether or not to bring this here and I decided I was going to

Synergy has blocked GoblinBot with little need It has been approved by Creol imo but Synergy claims that it is not approved as it does not have a flag

This came because I complained about UserTechman224 Interwiki Bot as it was flooding RecentChanges several times throughout today and had clearly exceeded its 50 edit test

Synergy claimed that any bot without the flag was not approved and so blocked mine as well as Techmans

I feel this is inappropriate as I had already told him and PeterSymonds on IRC when the concern was raised that I would not edit further with it until clarification or a flag was given

We need some policy on Bots urgently

Thanks

BG7even 1802 4 November 2008

Once a few more people show up and discuss this we can come to a decision as to whether unflagged bots can edit or if we will allow them to edit without a flag In my opinion I dont think we should And to us them for editing after a crat has not approved them is grounds for blocking Synergy 1825 4 November 2008

Hurricane Iniki was the 10th hurricane and the 7th major hurricane of the 1992 Pacific hurricane season Iniki was a powerful hurricane that affected Hawaii just weeks after Hurricane Andrew stuck Florida during the Atlantic hurricane season

The origin of Iniki is unclear but it possibly began as a tropical wave that shocked the African coast on August 18 It moved westward across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean and crossed Central America into the Pacific on the 28th the shock wave continued to go west and remained disorganized Conditions slowly became more favorable and as the convection concentrated around a center the wave was classified Tropical Depression Eighteen E on September 5 located 1700 miles southwest of Cabo San Lucas Mexico or 1550 miles east southeast of Hilo Hawaiokinai The depression continued quickly westward and remained weak until the 8th when it slowed enough to strengthen to a tropical storm Iniki continued to get stronger and became a hurricane on September 9 It turned north towards Hawaii and became major Hurricane the next day On September 11  962507662 2030 30 November 2011Iniki peaked as Category 4 hurricane and hit Hawaii with wind of 145 mph inki rapidly weakened ande went extra tropical Midway between Also and Hawaii

The Central Pacific Hurricane Center failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the hurricane well in advance For several days prior to the disaster the CPHC and the news media forecast Iniki to remain well south of the island chain with the only effect being some high surf conditions Some of the standard international computer models were indicating a northward turn towards the populated Hawaiian Islands but these were rejected by the CPHC forecasters CHPC Advisory 19 was issued at 11 AM local time on September 10 and suggested that a weakening Iniki would remain well to the south It was not until a special bulletin was issued by the CPHC at 630 PM on September 10  less than 24 hours before landfall  that any warning was given to the public 

A hurricane watch was issued for Kauaokinai early on September 11 and was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day Prior to Inikis arrival in Kauaokinai 8000 people were housed in shelters most of whom remembered Hurricane Iwa 10 years prior Rather than sending tourists to public shelters two major hotels kept their occupants in the buildings during the storms passage During the evacuation of the island people left days before to family friends or shelters Because schools were cancelled traffic was light and evacuation was well executed

The CPHC issued a tropical storm warning for Ookinaahu on September 11 which was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day Though not hit by the hurricane Inikis large wind field caused nearly 30000 people to evacuate to 110 public shelters in Ookinaahu Public school buildings acted as shelters and were for refuge only meaning they did not provide food cots blankets medications or other comfort items Roughly one third of Ookinaahus population participated in the evacuation though many others went to the house of a family member or friend for shelter The execution of the evacuations went well beginning with the vulnerable coastal area For those in need vans and buses gave emergency transportation while police manned certain overused intersections The two main problems that occurred during the evacuation were lack of parking at shelters and exit routes for the coastlines

Hurricane Iniki was the costliest hurricane to strike the state of Hawaiokinai causing 18 billion in damage Most damage was on the island of Kauaokinai where the storm destroyed thousands of homes and left a large amount of the island without power although Ookinaahu also suffered significant damage Iniki also was responsible for 6 deaths

The hurricane nearly struck the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu Had it hit there Iniki along with Hurricane Andrew and Typhoon Omar would have struck each of the three National Weather Service offices responsible for tropical cyclone warnings within a two month period

Doc Ock later after finishing the machine wants some more tritium to power it He wants to build rebuild his reactor to be even larger than before He forces Harry to give it to him by threatening to kill him Harry says he will give him the tritium as long as he brings Spider Man to him Doc Ock kidnaps Mary Jane forcing Peter to put his suit again A fight breaks out Finally Doc Ock puts a subway on course to crash Spider Man manages to stop the train with great effort but becomes very weak and is captured and tied up and brought to Harry Harry takes out a knife to kill him but is shocked and stopped when he pulls off Spider Mans mask to reveal that his friend Peter is underneath the mask Peter forces Harry to tell him where Doc Ock is and then goes down there to save Mary Jane and the city

Down at the river Doc Ock has rebuilt his reactor this one much larger than before Peter stuns him with an electric shock reveals who he is and convinces him to not do it and Doc Ock has a change of heart He says that the reactor is so big that only a river can contain it and uses his mechanical arms to destroy the floor underneath and dies in the process Peter reveals his secret identity to Mary Jane but says they cannot be together because Spider Mans enemies will target her

At the end of the movie Peter sits in his apartment and is very unhappy The wedding for Mary Jane Watson is about to take place but at the last minute she cancels and runs to the apartment There she tells him that she is willing to take the risk of being Spider Mans girlfriend A fire truck siren roars past She says Go get them tiger and watches as Spider Man goes out on another rescue mission

Eugne Henri Paul Gauguin was a leading Post Impressionist painter His bold tests with coloring led directly to the Synthetist style of modern art and the meaning of the subjects in his paintings helped create Primitivism and the return to the pastoral He was also an influential user of wood engraving and woodcuts as art forms

Pasties are small pieces of cloth plastic or metal They are treated specially so they are sticky They are used to cover a girls nipples or genital area They vary in size and are usually not much larger than the persons areola

The concept of pasties is to show as much of the breast as possible without making the woman entirely topless Many exotic dancers in strip clubs are required to wear them by law Pasties are usually applied with a special glue or tape This is the origin of their name as they are quite literally pasted onto the nipple

Pasties are worn by many neo burlesque performers Burlesque pasties may also feature tassels which hang from the center performer will sometimes twirl these as part of a performance 

Some women who choose not to wear a bra wear pasties to prevent their nipples from protruding visibly through their shirt 

The United States Supreme Court held in Erie v Paps AM that a city ordinance requiring erotic dancers to wear pasties and a g string was constitutional

Travis Landon Barker is an American drummer He is better known for being in the band Blink 182 He is also the drummer for 44 and has several side projects such as Box Car Racer Transplants and Expensive Taste

Guy de Maupassant was a popular 19th century French writer He is considered one of the fathers of the modern short story 

He was an apprentice of Flaubert Maupassants stories have a common economy of style and their efficient effortless dnouement Many of the stories are set during the Franco Prussian War Many more describe the war He also wrote six short novels

Prairie dogs are a type of mammal but they are not dogs They are small burrowing rodents a type of ground squirrel They live in short grass prairies and mountain plains of the western USA and Mexico The explorers Lewis and Clark sent a prairie dog to President Thomas Jefferson during their expedition it was quite strange to them

Prairie dogs are found in the United States Canada and Mexico In Mexico they are mostly found in the northern states which are the southern end of the great plains northeastern Sonora north and northeastern Chihuahua northern Coahuila northern Nuevo Len and northern Tamaulipas in the US they range primarily west of the Mississippi River though they have also been introduced in a few eastern locales They will eat all sorts of vegetables and fruits

Prairie dogs are mostly herbivores They eat grasses seeds leaves flowers fruit eggs and some insects

Highly social prairie dogs live in large colonies collections of prairie dog families that can span hundreds of acres Families usually are made up of one male and two to four females living in a strict social hierarchy Prairie dog pups reach sexual maturity at about 3 years of age and after their third winter the dominant male in a given family will drive them away forcing them to establish their own families on the edges of the colony The dominant male will defend the familys borders against rival prairie dogs and disputes are resolved by fighting Prairie dogs are also aggressive against predators such as badgers and snakes 

Prairie dogs are social animals and often make social visits with each other and greet each other with a sort of kiss Prairie dogs employ a complex form of communication that involves barks and rhythmic chirps

Prairie dog tunnel systems usually have several rooms Tunnels can go down as far as convert5mft and can extend laterally as much as convert30mft Prairie dogs line their burrows with grass to insulate them and the earth excavated from the burrow is piled up in mounds around the burrows entrance The prairie dogs use these carefully maintained mounds as observation posts

The prairie dog is well adapted to predators They can detect predators from a far distance and alert other prairie dogs to the danger with a special high pitched call Prairie dogs use different calls to identify specific predators Prairie dogs also trim the vegetation around their colonies perhaps to remove any cover for predators Their burrows generally contain several routes of escape

The prairie dog is chiefly herbivorous though it eats some insects It feeds primarily on grasses and in the fall broadleaf plants Prairie dogs have 1 6 pups yearly which are born blind and furless and need about 30 days of close nurturing from their mother

Sometimes two prairie dogs touch teeth with each other Researchers think they do this as a way of recognizing each other

Prairie dogs are hunted by many animals including wolves dogs coyotes bobcats foxes and humans

The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a 1831 French novel written by Victor Hugo It is set in 1482 in Paris in and around the cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris The story is about a poor Gypsy girl and a bell ringer who was raised by the archdeacon

Pierre Auguste Renoir was a French artist He was a leading painter who helped to create the Impressionist style He painted portraits and still life but above all he painted social scenes of the day 

As a painter of women especially feminine sensuality it has been said that Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from Rubens to Watteau

Pierre Auguste Renoir was born in Limoges Haute Vienne France the child of a working class family As a boy he worked in a porcelain factory where his drawing talents led to him being chosen to paint designs on fine china He also painted hangings for overseas missionaries and decorations on fans before he enrolled in art school During those early years he often visited the Louvre to study the French master painters

In the late 1860s through the practice of painting light and water en plein air he and his friend Claude Monet discovered that the color of shadows is not brown or black but the reflected color of the objects surrounding them an effect today known as diffuse reflection Several pairs of paintings exist in which Renoir and Monet working side by side depicted the same scenes 

Renoir experienced his initial acclaim when six of his paintings hung in the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874 In the same year two of his works were shown with Paul Durand Ruel in London

One of the best known Impressionist works is Renoirs 1876 Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette The painting depicts an open air scene crowded with people at a popular dance garden on the Butte Montmartre close to where he lived

The works of his early maturity were typically Impressionist snapshots of real life full of sparkling colour and light

A trip to Italy in 1881 when he saw works by Raphael and other Renaissance masters that convinced him that he was on the wrong path For the next several years he painted in a more severe classical style After 1890 however he changed direction again returning to thinly brushed colour to dissolve outlines as in his earlier work From this period onward he concentrated on nudes and domestic scenes

A prolific artist he made several thousand paintings The warm sensuality of Renoirs style made his paintings some of the most well known and reproduced works in the history of art The single largest collection of his works181 paintings in allis at the Barnes Foundation near Philadelphia Pennsylvania 

In 1890 he married Aline Victorine Charigot She with a number of the artists friends had been a model for Le Djeuner des canotiers They already had a child Pierre in 1885 After his marriage Renoir painted many scenes of his wife and daily family life including their children and their nurse Alines cousin The Renoirs had three sons one of whom Jean became a film director of note and another Pierre became a stage and film actor

Around 1892 Renoir developed rheumatoid arthritis In 1907 he moved to the warmer climate of Les Collettes a farm at Cagnes sur Mer close to the Mediterranean coast Renoir painted during the last twenty years of his life even when arthritis severely limited his movement and he was wheelchair bound He developed progressive deformities in his hands and ankylosis of his right shoulder requiring him to adapt his painting technique It has often been reported that in the advanced stages of his arthritis he painted by having a brush strapped to his paralyzed fingers but this is erroneous Renoir remained able to grasp a brush although he required an assistant to place it in his hand The wrapping of his hands with bandages apparent in late photographs of the artist served to prevent skin irritation

During this period he created sculptures by cooperating with a young artist Richard Guino who worked the clay Renoir also used a moving canvas or picture roll to help him paint large works

In 1919 Renoir visited the Louvre to see his paintings hanging with the old masters He died in the village of Cagnes sur Mer Provence Alpes Cte dAzur on December 3

Jean Antoine Watteau was a French painter whose brief career spurred the revival of interest in colour and movement and brought back the almost forgotten Baroque idiom which in time became known as Rococo He is credited with inventing the genre of ftes galantes scenes of bucolic and idyllic charm along with an air of theatricality Some of his best known subjects were drawn from the world of Italian comedy and ballet

Soggy biscuit is a masturbation game played mostly by teenage groups in which the participants stand around a biscuit masturbating until ejaculating onto it the last person to do so must eat the biscuit The term is thought to have originated in Australia sometime in the 1960s

Although the way its spelled may differ slightly the notability of the game is shown by the variations on the being referred to in popular culture examples including Stephen Frys The Liar the German movie Crazy and Skinlesss song Scum Cookie 

Hurricane Isabel was the costliest and deadliest hurricane in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season It was the ninth named storm fifth hurricane and second major hurricane of the season Isabel formed from a tropical wave in the tropical Atlantic Ocean It moved northwestward and it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165 mph on September 11 After weakening and strengthening for four days Isabel slowly weakened It moved onto the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105 mph on September 18 It quickly weakened over land

In North Carolina the storm surge from Isabel washed away part of Hatteras Island This area of washed away land was sometimes known as Isabel Inlet Damage was highest along the Outer Banks where thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed The worst effects happened in Virginia especially in the Hampton Roads area and on the shores of the James River Virginia had the most deaths and damage from the hurricane About 64 of the total damage and 68 of the total deaths from the storm happened in North Carolina and Virginia

There was moderate to severe damage up the Atlantic coastline and as far west as West Virginia About six million lost power in the eastern United States Rain fell from South Carolina to Maine and westward to Michigan In total damage is estimated at 36 billion 16 deaths in seven states are blamed directly on the hurricane 35 more deaths in six states and one province were not directly related to the hurricane

Ferdinand Victor Eugne Delacroix was a French Romantic artist regarded from the outset of his career as the leader of the French Romantic school Delacroixs use of expressive brushstrokes and his study of the optical effects of colour profoundly shaped the work of the Impressionists while his passion for the exotic inspired the artists of the Symbolist movement A fine lithographer Delacroix illustrated various works of William Shakespeare the Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott and the German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe 

In contrast to the Neoclassical perfectionism of his chief rival Ingres Delacroix took for his inspiration the art of Rubens and painters of the Venetian Renaissance with an attendant emphasis on color and movement rather than clarity of outline and carefully modeled form Dramatic and romantic content characterized the central themes of his maturity and led him not to the classical models of Greek and Roman art but to travel in North Africa in search of the exotic Friend and spiritual heir to Thodore Gricault Delacroix was also inspired by Byron with whom he shared a strong identification with the forces of the sublime of nature in often violent action

However Delacroix was given neither to sentimentality nor bombast and his Romanticism was that of an individualist In the words of Baudelaire Delacroix was passionately in love with passion but coldly determined to express passion as clearly as possible

Delacroix was a member of the Club des Hashischins or Hashish Club This group of French writers experimented with hashish to get ideas

Jean Louis Marie Eugne Durieu was an early French photographer of nudes known for making studies for Eugne Delacroix Some of Durieus nudes were used by Delacroix to creating his own paintings and drawings

Anabolism is the set of metabolic pathways that build molecules from smaller units

A period also known as a full stop in punctuation is a dot that is at the end of a sentence It shows that an idea has finished

When it is used in numbers it is called a decimal point It shows that the numbers to the right of it are less than one as in 1234 When it is used to write money in numbers it shows that the numbers to the right of it are less than one pounddollareuro For example

means that Elizabeth paid one dollar and twenty five cents for her drink

A period also means a word has been shortened when it is after the word for example Pty Ltd The words doctor mister and mistress are often made shorter when used with a name Dr Smith is the name of a doctor whose last name is Smith and Mr Banerjee and Mrs Yang are common ways of writing Mister Banerjee and Mistress Yang It is also used for names when the first and middle name are shortened but the last name is not for example J Citizen

When three periods are used together they are called an ellipsis

A hyphen looks like this  Hyphens have many uses in writing

SHE is a Taiwanese girl group with three people Selina Ren Hebe Tien and Ella Chen The groups name comes from the first letter of each persons name A record label called HIM International Music created SHE after they organized a singing competition in 2000 

At first there was supposed to be only one winner that person was Selina Ren But then the record label thought that the other two girls Hebe Tien and Ella Chen were good singers too so they put the three girls together Since the release of Girls Dorm SHEs first album in 2001 the group has released a total of 11 albums and sold over 45 million copies However some people do not like SHE because they often sing songs that other people had sung before In addition to music the trio has acted in many TV dramas and sang many theme songs for them Because of SHEs success some Taiwanese companies are now trying to create girl groups of their own

In electronics a multiplexer or mux is a device that selects one of many analog or digital input signals and outputs it into a single output line This process is termed multiplexing

An electronic multiplexer makes it possible for several signals to share one expensive device or other resource for example one AD converter or one communication line instead of having one device per input signal 

An analog multiplexer is a special type of analog switch that connects one signal selected from several inputs to a single output

A digital multiplexer is a set of parallel switches with selector that selects one of the input digital channels to outputs into the single digital output channel The selector selects one of the input channels according to the digital command it receives

In electronics a demultiplexer is a device taking a single input signal and selecting one of many data output lines which is connected to the single input A multiplexer is often used with a complementary demultiplexer on the receiving end 

An electronic multiplexer can be considered as a multiple input single output switch and a demultiplexer as a single input multiple output switch 

In telecommunications and signal processing a multiplexer is a device that combines several input information signals into one output signal which carries several communication channels by means of some multiplex technique A demultiplexer is in this context a device that takes a single input signal that carries many channels and separates the channels over multiple output signals

One cost saving use for multiplexers is connecting a multiplexer and a demultiplexer together over a single communication channel The image to the right demonstrates this

In this case the cost of implementing separate channels for each data source is more expensive than the cost of implementing the multiplexingdemultiplexing functions

At the receiving end of the data link a complementary demultiplexer is normally required to break single data stream back down into the original streams

In some cases the far end system may have more functionality than a simple demultiplexer and so at the same time as the demultiplexing still exists logically it may never actually happen physically such as in network address translation where a number of IP private network users are multiplexed over a single public IP address

Tramway means more than one thing

In computing inputoutput or IO refers to the communication between a digital processing system and the outside world possibly a human another processing system or a device 

Inputs are the signals or data received by the system and outputs are the signals or data sent from it 

IO devices are used by a person to communicate with the digital processing system For instance keyboards and mice are considered input devices of a computer while monitors and printers are considered output devices of a computer Devices for communication between computers such as modems and network cards typically serve for both input and output

Note that the description of a device as either input or output depends on how it is viewed Mouses and keyboards take as input physical movement that the human user outputs and convert it into signals that a computer can understand The output from these devices is input for the computer Similarly printers and monitors take as input signals that a computer outputs They then convert these signals into representations that human users can see or read

An instruction set is a list of all the instructions with all their variations that a processor can execute

Instructions include

An instruction set or instruction set architecture is the part of the computer architecture related to programming including the native data types instructions registers addressing modes memory architecture interrupt and exception handling and external IO An ISA includes a specification of the set of opcodes the native commands implemented by a particular CPU design

Instruction set architecture is distinguished from the microarchitecture microarchitecture is the detailed description of the system that is sufficient for completely describing the operation of all parts of the computing system and how they are inter connected and inter operate in order to implement the Instruction set architecture

Computers with different microarchitectures can share a common instruction set For example the Intel Pentium and the AMD Athlon implement nearly identical versions of the x86 instruction set but they are very different in internal designs

Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is a Hindu nationalist organization in India It was founded in 1925 by KB Hedgewar The organization is accused of having fascist tendencies

In electrical engineering power consumption often refers to the electrical energy over time supplied to operate an electrical appliance

The energy used by equipment is always more than the energy really needed This is because no equipment is 100 efficient Power is wasted as heat vibrations andor electromagnetic radiation

Power consumption is usually measured in units of kilowatt hours

More accurately power is the rate of consumption of energy measured in watts or horsepower

Hindutva is an ideology which is centered around the following beliefs

The Hindutva ideology is the central tenet of the organizations which advocate Hindu nationalism

Many proponents of the Hindutva ideology portray violence against Muslims and Christians as a form of self defence against invaders As the Hindutva ideology has grown more powerful over the years many Hindutva activists have partaken in riots against minority communities in India The Hindutva ideology is described as a fascist ideology Although this ideology is associated with Hinduism majority of Hindus who are tolerant or secular do not support the Hindutva movement Some tolerant or secular Hindus describe the supporters of the Hindutva movement as Hindu Taliban

Phetchabun is a town in the Northeastern and the central of Thailand It is about 12668416 m2 in size The distance from the east to the west is 55 km The distance from the north to the south is 296 km The height above sea level is 114m Phetchabun is 346 km from Bangkok

The administrative distributes to are 11 districts 117 subdistricts 1261 village

Phetchabun is an ancient city that doesnt appear clearly who discover it Krom Phraya Dhamlong Racha Nupap analyses that Phetchabun established for 2 periods in the same relic of Buddha temple and ancient temple  At first age built when  the northland is Sukhothai city or Phitsanulok is the capital There is the waterway in a public city The second period built in Narais period There was a river at the center of a city In the north side had a wall for Guading the enemies In the south there was a field And archeologist discover the evidence in Si Thep city The evidence had age more than 1000 years Phetchabun was built in the same time as Phimai Lopburi

Very Long Instruction Word or VLIW which refers to a CPU architecture designed to take advantage of instruction level parallelism but at minimum level of hardware complexities

A processor that executes every instruction one after the other may use processor resources inefficiently leading to poor performance The performance can be improved by using micro architectural design techniques that use ILP including

All above ILP techniques are implemented at a higher cost with increased hardware complexity Before executing any operations in parallel the processor must verify that the instructions do not have interdependencies There are many types of interdependencies but a simple example would be a program in which the first instructions result is used as an input for the second instruction They clearly cannot execute at the same time and the second instruction cannot be executed before the first Modern out of order processors use major resources in order to take advantage of these techniques since the scheduling of instructions must be determined dynamically as a program executes based on dependencies

The VLIW approach on the other hand executes operation in parallel based on a fixed schedule determined when programs are compiled Since determining the order of execution of operations is handled by the compiler the processor does not need the complex hardware required by ILP techniques described above As a result VLIW CPUs offer significant computational power with less hardware complexity but with greater compiler design complexity

The VLIW approach is a concept which is only useful as the code generated by a compiler makes it but with a number of special purpose instructions available to simplify certain complicated operations

Goatsecx was an Internet shock site The page featured a picture hellojpg showing an undressed man stretching his butt to a large size with both hands with the inside of his rectum clearly visible Below his gaping anus his dangling penis and scrotum were visible as well as a ring on the ring finger of his left hand

The image hellojpg comes from a set of forty pictures from a file named gapzip In those images the man used sex toys and butt plugs to stretch his anus The images were located by Stile Project and are also available from the Contrib section of the goatsecx website under the filename gapzip hellojpg is the third file in the archive gap3jpg

On January 14 2004 the domain goatsecx was closed for a time by Christmas Island Internet Administration for policy violations in response to a complaint but many mirrors of the site are still available and the picture is displayed on many websites

In January 2007 Christmas Island Internet Administration put the domain goatsecx back into the pool of available domains The domain was then registered on January 16 through domain registrar Variomedia and the current holder tried to auction off the right to use the domain

The goatsecx domain name was reported sold at an auction on April 30 2007 to an unknown bidder According to seobiddingcom the first auction ended with fake bids so the auction was reactivated This was again won by fake bidders so Seobiddingcom announced that the website would be sold for 500000 and that legal action would be pursued against the fake bidders On November 25 2007 the site was for sale on seobidding goatsecx asking 50200 minimum

Control of the domain was moved to the another market and was taken by domain squatters who were trying to sell the domain name for 10000 euros

On July 4 2008 the site was open again with a picture of Bill OReilly and a legal notice The file name and text remained the same as before

As of September 28 2008 the site was again put up for sale and the picture changed once again because of a legal order from Fox Broadcasting Company ordering the owner to stop showing a picture of Bill OReillyFactdateNovember 2008

The site used the cx country code the top level domain of the Australian territory of Christmas Island The actual computer server of Goatsecx was not on Christmas Island but in the United States and was owned by Hickorg a website about computer programming and bathroom humor The Hickorg domain was registered by Matt Miller in Overland Park Kansas Both Goatsecx and Hickorg originated from the same IP address the server was in Kansas City Missouri metro region Goatcx formerly a mirror of Goatsecx was in the Dallas Texas metro region while current mirror Goatseru is in Russia

Many Internet users have been tricked into looking at the site at one time or another it has become something of an Internet meme As such hellojpg and the other images on the site are common subjects of parodies and tributes

After Hurricane Charley in August 2004 an image purporting to show the hands of God in the cloud formations in the aftermath of the disaster circulated in email The image was proven to be a false Goatse parody

In June 2007 a parody of the 2012 Summer Olympics logo sent by Sean Stayte appeared on the BBC News website under the alternative Olympic Logo entries and was broadcast on their BBC News 24 channel Two hands were pulling the 0 from 2012 apart The image was later shown as part of a gallery of viewers logos on BBC London News and BBC News 24 and was subsequently removed from the website The editor of the BBC News website stated the mistake in his blog saying his team simply didnt spot it

Modesty is the name for a number of norms of behaviour a society expects form the individual people that make up this society

Modesty usually includes

Different fashions test the level of modesty People are usually also subjected to peer pressure

Different levels of modesty apply in different situations and to different groups of people

Modesty is a social norm it does not apply when it cannot such as in an emergency In the case of an emergency it is more important that doctors treat those that are wounded It does not matter that doctors may see those people naked In some cases it may be necessary that they take off all the clothes to be able to treat them better

Some people still insist on maintaining their standards of modesty even in an emergency situation

Modesty usually says that the parts of the human body that do not need to be exposed should not be Usually this applies to bare skin hair undergarments and especially to intimate parts Sometimes the standards do not only say that the respective part should be hidden but also that special clothing should hide its shape what it looks like Certain standards say how the changing of clothes should be done like using a towel on a beach or closing a door of a cabin that is provided

Different cultures have different standards of modesty But standards are also different according to who the other people are that could possibly see ones body

Social standing or class can also matter That way different rules can apply to people of the same social class than to those of other social classes 

Other things that influence these norms include

That way a teacher that would perform at a night club might be seen as bringing the profession into disresapect Some people say this kind of modesty is body shame

Too much modesty is called prudishness As a medical condition it is also called gymnophobia Excessive immodesty is called exhibitionism Proponents of modesty often see it as respect for their bodies and the feelings of themselves and others and some people believe it may reduce sexual crimes Critics argue that its not healthy to have a negative attitude toward the human body Some assert that there may be a correlation between repressive body attitudes and undesirable outcomes such as sexual crimes violence and stress

The cultural and religious background heavily influence the views a person has on modesty 

What is called Western culture expects that Intimate body parts are covered in public places at all times There are exceptions for places where people change clothes as these are usually differentiated by sex This means there is one changing room for men and another for women Other exceptions include saunas which tend to be mixed sex places 

Special rules also apply for places where bathing is common It might be tolerated that a woman is topless on a beach or near a pool If there is a restaurant near the beach or pool it is usual that the woman can be topless on the beach but if she wants to eat something in the restaurant that she has to cover her breasts Very often such restaurants are visually segregated by a railing On one side of the railing there is the beach on the other there is the restaurant

There are more and more beaches in cities This blurs the boundary even more There may be people in swimsuits next to businesspeople in a suit 

In private homes the rules may be more relaxed Nudity among close family members in the home is sometimes permitted especially in the bedroom and bathroom Wearing undergarments casually may be permitted as well Elsewhere in the home family members may be expected to wear more clothes casually especially if guests are present A bathrobe may fulfill the purpose here

Naturists have different views They want to create an environment were people can feel at ease even when they are nude they can be seen nude or nude people are among them These values conflict with the current standards of modesty For this reason nudists mostly reject the current standards of modesty

Traditional indigenous cultures such as those in Africa or the aborigines in Australia have social norms that vary greatly How much exposure is acceptable varies from nothing for some women to everything except the glans penis for some men of certain tribes Certain African cultures think body painting is body coverage Many think it is an attire

There are different standards of modesty for men and women Western culture expects that both men and women keep their genitals covered It also expects that women keep their breasts covered most of the time There may be exceptions for bathing or breastfeeding

Showing naked soldiers bathing became common during the Second World War Boys in high school age also swam in the nude during that time

Catholics are expected to dress modestly but there are no official guidelines Form time to time priests and popes have given their opinion These opinions are not binding nevertheless many Catholics find them useful 

Pope Pius XII stated that women should cover their upper arms and shoulders that their skirts should cover at least as far as the knee and the neckline should not reveal anything Another example is Giuseppe Cardinal Siri of Genoa who stated that trousers were unacceptable dress for women Many tradition minded Catholics have attempted to further expand on this latter standard

The Church also expects men to dress modestly but the demands are not as strict for them as for women this is largely because men are often thought to be more inherently susceptible to sexual thoughts

The first philosopher to outline these themes was Antisthenes who had been a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BCE He was followed by Diogenes of Sinope who lived in a tub on the streets of Athens took Cynicism to its logical extremes and came to be seen as the archetypal Cynic philosopher He was followed by Crates of Thebes who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens Cynicism spread with the rise of Imperial Rome in the 1st century and Cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the Empire It finally disappeared in the late 5th century although many of its ascetic and rhetorical ideas were adopted by early Christians

In cryptography a trusted third party is an entity which makes interactions between two parties easy Both parties must trust the third party they use this trust to secure their own interactions

TTPs are commonly used by cryptosystems

The term Needham Schroeder protocol can refer to one of two communication protocols intended for use over an insecure network both protocols designed by Roger Needham and Michael Schroeder 

The two protocols are

Poverty in Pakistan is a growing concern Although the middle class has grown in Pakistan nearly one quarter of the population is classified poor as of October 2006

Kerberos is a computer network authentication protocol which allows people communicating over a non secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner It is also a suite of free software published by Massachusetts Institute of Technology that implements this protocol Its designers aimed primarily at a client server model and it provides mutual authentication both the user and the server verify each others identity Kerberos protocol messages are protected against spying and replay attacks

Kerberos performs authentication as a trusted third party authentication service by using cryptographic shared secret under the assumption that packets traveling along the insecure network can be read modified and inserted Kerberos builds on symmetric key cryptography and requires a key distribution center Extensions to Kerberos can provide for the use of public key cryptography during certain phases of authentication

MIT developed Kerberos to protect network services provided by Project Athena The protocol was named after the Greek mythological character Kerberos known in Greek mythology as being the monstrous three headed guard dog of Hades Several versions of the protocol exist versions 13 used only internally at MIT

Steve Miller and Clifford Neuman the primary designers of Kerberos version 4 published that version in 1989 although they had targeted it primarily for Project Athena 

Version 5 designed by John Kohl and Clifford Neuman appeared as RFC 1510 in 1993 with the intention of overcoming the limitations and security problems of Version 4 The MIT makes an implementation of Kerberos Version 5 freely available under a software license similar to that used by BSD license

Several companies used Kerberos Version 5 in commercial software including

Some Microsoft additions to the Kerberos suite of protocols are documented in RFC 3244 Microsoft Windows 2000 Kerberos Change Password and Set Password Protocols RFC 4757 documents Microsofts use of the RC4 cipher While Microsoft uses the Kerberos protocol it does not use the MIT software 

In 2005 the IETF Kerberos working group introduced a new updated specifications for Kerberos Version 5 updates include

In 2007 MIT formed the Kerberos Consortium for continuation of development

Kerberos uses as its basis the Needham Schroeder protocol It makes use of a trusted third party authentication known as key distribution center which consists of two logically separate parts an Authentication Server and a Ticket Granting Server Kerberos works on the basis of tickets which serve to prove the identity of users

Kerberos database The key distribution center maintains a database of secret keys each entity on the network whether a client or a server shares a secret key known only to itself and to the KDC Knowledge of this key serves to prove the identity of each entity For communication between two entities the KDC generates a session key which they can use to secure their communications

The term Kerberos server generally refers to the KDC For reliability purposes it is possible to have backup KDCs These are referred to as Kerberos slave servers All slaves synchronize their databases from the master Kerberos server 

The term Kerberized application server generally refers to Kerberized programs that clients communicate with using Kerberos tickets for authentication For example the Kerberos telnet server is an example of a Kerberized application server While the term The term Kerberized applications is used to referrer to the client side of Kerberized application server For example the Kerberos telnet client is an example of a Kerberized applications

The security of the protocol depends heavily on

The following abbreviations will be used

Briefly the client authenticates to AS using a long term shared secret and receives a ticket from the AS Later the client can use this ticket to get additional tickets for SS using the same shared secret These tickets can be used to prove authentication to SS

User Client based Logon Steps

Client Authentication Steps

Sample message User XYZ would like to request services Note Neither the secret key nor the password is sent to the AS

Note The client cannot decrypt Message B as it is encrypted using TGSs secret key 

Client Service Authorization Steps

Client Service Request Steps

In cryptography a key distribution center is part of a cryptosystem intended to minimize the risks of exchanging keys and shared secrets

KDCs often operate in systems when some users may have permission to use certain resources at some times but not at any times

Alonzo Church was an American mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematical logic and the foundations of theoretical computer science He is best known for the lambda calculus Churchs thesis and the Church Rosser theorem

A software suite or application suite is a set of computer programs of related purpose often sharing a more or less common user interface and can exchange data with each other

Sometimes software suites are at a lower price than buying each of suite programs

Nonviolence is a philosophy that rejects the use of physical violence People who practice nonviolence may use methods like education persuasion civil disobedience and nonviolent direct action

Abolitionism was a movement that wanted to get rid of slavery in Europe and in America It was mainly active during the 18th century Until the 18th century only very few people criticized slavery But thinkers of the Enlightenment started to criticize it because in their opinion slavery was against the human rights Communities like the Quakers thought that slavery was contradicting with Christianity

The Outsiders is a novel by S E Hinton first published in 1967 by Viking Press Hinton was 15 when she began writing the novel and 16 when it was published The Outsiders is the lifestory of fourteen year old Ponyboy Michael Curtis Hinton explores a multitude of themes throughout the story such as friendship and coming of age They are seen by following two rival groups the Greasers and the Socs who are separated by status

The story starts when Ponyboy leaves a movie showing area and Socs jump on him His brother Darry saves him He talks about Socs and Greasers and how they are apart Later his friend Johnny kills a Soc and they go run like terrorists to an old house of worship and bomb it

Civil disobedience is the active refusal to obey certain laws demands and commands of a government or of an occupying power without resorting to physical violence It is one of the primary tactics of nonviolent resistance 

The American author Henry David Thoreau pioneered the modern theory behind this practice in his 1849 essay Civil Disobedience originally titled Resistance to Civil Government

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi used non violent civil disobedience in South Africa in a campaign for civil rights for the people who came from India and lived in South Africa This campaign was from 1893 1914 When Gandhi returned to India he used civil disobedience in the campaign for the independence of India from the British rule

Dr Martin Luther King Jr and young activists in the American civil rights movement of the 1960s also adopted civil disobedience techniques during and after the Vietnam War

Henry David Thoreau was an American author naturalist and philosopher He is best known for his book Walden a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings and his essay Civil Disobedience an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state

Naturism or nudism is a term used by many action groups in society These action groups usually want to spread the news that being naked is a good feeling even around other people and often with males and females mixed together Usually nakedness is seen without any relation to sex Rather these action groups want to enjoy common activities in the nude like bathing Often they also want to do things nude where this is not really necessary like naked bicycle tours

It is difficult to know exactly when naturism began as an action group In 1903 Paul Zimmermann opened the first club Freilichtpark near Hamburg Germany In the United States German immigrant Kurt Barthel organized the first nudist event in the forest just outside of New York City His club was called the American League for Physical Culture and started in the late 1920s Zimmermanns vice president was a man named Ilsley Boone Boone had been a minister of a large church He quit to become involved with naturism all the time and soon replaced Zimmermann as president Also he renamed the ALPC as the American Sunbathing Association Since 1995 it is known as the American Association for Nude Recreation

Naturists come from many different social classes and backgrounds and practice naturism for very different reasons In addition religion can effect how people dress Islam generally does not allow anyone to be seen naked by others except married couples in private and young children by their parents and caregivers Traditional Judaism is similar but less strict about a group of people of the same sex In India Hinduism and Jainism have a few rituals with male nudism Buddhism has little to say about naturism If practiced it is considered more of a way of living than anything religious Within Christianity nudity and naturism are probably the most complicated of all religions Many Christians have similar views as those of traditional Judaism the religion from which Christianity began and grew out of Others called Christian naturists believe it is alright to be nude and even to live nude unless it is for the wrong reason or forced The human body is considered by them to be the greatest creation of God and is neither shameful nor should be covered In addition they believe it was the devil not God who told Adam and Eve that they were naked upon eating from a fruit tree which was not theirs

The Turkic languages are a language family of some thirty languages They are spoken by Turkic peoples across an area from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean to Siberia and Western China Traditionally people think that they are part of the Altaic language family

Turkic languages are spoken by some 180 million people as a native language and the total number of Turkic speakers is about 200 million including speakers as a second language The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is Turkish proper or Anatolian Turkish The speakers of this language are about 40 of all Turkic speakers

The geographical distribution of Turkic speaking peoples across Eurasia spreads from Turkey in the West to the North East of Siberia

The Kansas Turnpike is a road in Kansas part of the United States The road is a turnpikea payment must be made to use it The road is 236 miles or 380 kilometers long It starts at the line between Kansas and Oklahoma and goes to Kansas City It runs through many important cities in Kansas including Wichita Topeka Lawrence and Kansas City The Kansas Turnpike is owned and repaired by the Kansas Turnpike Authority which is based in Wichita

The Kansas Turnpike was built between 1954 and 1956 It was built before the Interstate Highway System The turnpike was not part of the Interstate System at first However it became part of the system in 1956 Parts of the turnpike also are parts of four Interstate Highways I 35 I 335 I 470 and I 70

Around 120000 people use the Kansas Turnpike every day KTA helps users by running a radio station about the road It has also built places called service areas where people can stop and rest and buy gasoline and things to eat One service area has a memorial to American football coach Knute Rockne who died near the turnpike

The Kansas Turnpike Authority does not need tax money to pay for repairs to the road The payments from users are used to pay for the repairs instead

John Dewey was born in Burlington Vermont on October 20th 1859 He studied philosophy and graduated at the University of Vermont and afterwards taught at many schools In September 1882 Dewey went to the John Hopkins University and studied philosophy and psychology and published the paper The New Psychology Afterwards he taught psychology at universities and later on got married to Alice Chipman On 1886 he started a new school which came to be known as the Dewey School This school taught pragmatism which says that a schools curriculum should be based on everyday life lessons and focuses on hands on activities to better help students learn After he retired as a teacher he continued watching and figuring the society and politics John Dewey died in 1952

John Dewey believed in the theory of inquiry which shows how animals survived in their environment He used the theory in the way he taught He said that children learn best with real life problems and hands on activities His most well known essay was The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology which created the stimulus that became the response which later became known as social behaviorism For example a person focuses on something decides what to do then acts on the decision

The Middle is a 2001 song released by Jimmy Eat World from their album Bleed American its the third song from their album

The song is not whats usually heard from the band and is one of the more straight forward upbeat songs its also one of their most well known singles

The band are featured in this music video It also shows girls in their Bikini and a swimming pool and someone goes into it during the guitar solo so for a moment its kinda faded out but then he goes back to the surface At the start of this video two people in a car get out and go inside to the party

Bleed American is the fourth album released by Jimmy Eat World and was made available in 2001 They had to change the title in stores to Salt Sweat Sugar because they were scared Bleed American would be taken the wrong way possibly in an offensive way due to the September 11 attacks

On the second song Praise chorus they mention old songs such as our house in the middle of the street Davey Von Bohlen from The promise ring does some of the vocals for the song

Hear you me is believed to be written for two fans who died its also referring to the weezer song

The authority song makes certain references to the Pop culture  the dj never has it jamc automatic if those were roys headphones youd bet he play what goes on

The Blackpool tramway is a tramway that runs from Blackpool to Fleetwood on the Fylde Coast in Lancashire England The tramway was built in 1885 It is one of the oldest electric tramways in the world and is the only one of the earliest tramways that is still in operation in the United Kingdom 

The tramway is owned by Blackpool Borough Council and is run by Blackpool Transport as part of the Metro Coastlines network The tramway runs for convert11mikm1lkon and over 6500000 people travel on it each year 

The first part of Blackpool tramway opened on 29 September 1885 It was a conduit line It ran from Cocker Street to Dean Street on the Blackpool Promenade This was one of the first practical electric tramways built in the world It opened six years after Werner von Siemens first showed electric traction At the opening was Holroyd Smith the person who created the system and Alderman Harwood the Mayor of Manchester along with many other people

The Blackpool Electric Tramway Company ran the line until 1892 At this point the lease on the line finished and Blackpool Corporation then ran the line In 1895 another line was added It ran from Manchester Square along Lytham Road to South Shore In 1897 the tracks were extended to South Pier A line was also built on Station Road that connected Lytham Road to the promenade

The conduit system was changed to overhead wires in 1899 In 1900 the line was built more to the north to Gynn Square It linked up the Blackpool Fleetwood Tramroad there The Marton loop opened in 1901 It connected Talbot Square and Central Station along Church Street Devonshire Square Whitegate Drive Waterloo Road and Central Drive At Whitegate Drive in Marton a new depot was built Another line was added from Talbot Square along Talbot Road to Layton on 1902 The promenade line had got as far as the Pleasure Beach by 1903

The Blackpool Corporation took over the Blackpool Fleetwood Tramroad Company in 1920 The Corporation got eight miles of track and three depots from the take over Two depots were in Fleetwood and one was in Bispham The small Bold Street Depot in Fleetwood was closed and a new loop was built at Fleetwood Ferry

The depot at Blundell Street was replaced by a bigger one on Rigby Road in 1920 In 1925 the line to Fleetwood was made more direct between Rossall and Broadwater The last extension was built in 1926 It went along the promenade to Clifton Drive at Starr Gate A connection was made there with the Lytham St Annes tracks

The first route closure took place in 1936 They were the Central Drive and Layton routes In 1961 Lytham Road closed and Marton closed one year later The tramroad line on Dickson Road to North Station closed in 1963 Marton and Copse Road Depots closed in the same year The depot at Bispham closed in 1966 All that was left was the track running from Starr Gate to Fleetwood It is still there today The running of the buses and tramway was handed over to Blackpool Transport Services Limited in 1986 by Blackpool Borough Council

Today the tramway runs from Starr Gate in Blackpool to the Ferry Terminus in Fleetwood Most of the route runs along the Fylde Coast sea front At Cleveleys the line turns inland for a few miles It then returns to the coast in Fleetwood There are four different types of track

On the line there are four turning loops One is at Starr Gate another is opposite the Pleasure Beach and two more are at Little Bispham and Fleetwood There is also one that links into Rigby Road Depot

Blackpool runs a mix of double deck and single deck cars though there are more single deck trams in the fleet The double deck trams are used the most in the tourist season The single deck trams are not used as much at that time They are sometimes used though when it is busy to let the system carry more passengers Blackpool was the only town in the UK that kept its trams Between 1962 and 1992 Blackpool was the only town with a tramway in the UK that was not a preserved system The last English city to lose its trams was Sheffield in 1960 The last in the UK was Glasgow in 1962 Trams have been returning to the towns and cities in Britain since the Manchester Metrolink opened in Manchester in 1992

There are lots of different trams in the fleet at Blackpool Most of them were built in the 1930s and are still in service in an unchanged condition Some others have had their bodywork changed Sometime historic trams are borrowed from the National Tramway Museum in Crich and other museums for public service

The trams from Starr Gate in the south to Fleetwood in the north At busy periods such as the Blackpool Illuminations or on bank holidays services start or finish short at Cleveleys Bispham or the Pleasure Beach This means that more trams can run through the centre of Blackpool in a small period When the Illuminations are on specially decorated trams carry passengers along the promenade and the illuminated area The area runs from Starr Gate to Bispham Until the opening of the Metrolink Fleetwood was the only town in England that kept trams running down the main street

In November 2007 the whole tramway closed for the first time It was closed for five months for the second part of an 11800000 upgrade Blackpool Transport Services and Blackpool Council currently have a joint bid awaiting Government approval It could give up to 77000000 for a total upgrade of the trams and tracks In January 2007 the City Class 611 prototype supertram was being tested on the tramway It caught fire as it approached Central Pier This caused lots of damage The driver managed to get out of the cab The tram was built by Mersyside based Tram Power It was being tested as part of a bid to replace the current trams The same tram had already derailed on 30 May 2006 at Starr Gate loop in trials then A Rail Accident Investigation Board report said that the derailmet was because of wear and tear on the track They said another factor was the new type of running gear on the two car prototype

The company paid 150000 to rebuild the tramcar It cannot be re tested until November 2008 at the earliest though This is because testing is not allowed during the busy summer months and also because of the earlier closure of the tracks for repairs 

The Ancient Church of the East separated from the Assyrian Church of the East This happened because Mar Shimun XXIII the patriarch of Assyrian Church of the East introduced reforms which were not supported These reforms included changes such as those of using the new Roman calendar rather than the old calendar The people who did not support the changes thought they were opposed to the sanctity of being one of the oldest Christian churches in the world For this reason the followers of the Ancient Church of the East resisted the changes made to the church Mar Thoma Darmo a native of Mesopotamia who was Metropolitan of the Assyrian Church of the East in India from 1952 to 1968 based at Trichur separated from the Assyrian Church of the East He became the head of the Ancient Church of the East in October 1968 and moved to Baghdad He died the following year Following his death Mar Addai II was elected to replace him

In telecommunications cleartext is the form of a message or data which is in a form that is immediately understandable to a human being without additional processing In particular it implies that this message is sent or stored without cryptographic protection The phrases in clear en clair and in the clear are the same 

It is close to but not entirely the same as the term plaintext Formally plaintext is information that is fed as an input to a coding process while ciphertext is what comes out of that process Plaintext might be compressed coded or otherwise changed before the coding process is done so it is quite common to find plaintext that is not cleartext

Websites using insecure HTTP send using cleartext with all data supplied being sent from the users computer through the internet using cleartext Anyone with access to the medium used to carry the data may read the password username and anything else sent to the website

A print server or printer server is a computer or device that is connected to one or more printers and to a network It accepts print jobs from client computers then prints the jobs on the requested printer

Project Athena was a joint project of MIT Digital Equipment Corporation and IBM It was launched in 1983 and research and development continued until June 30 1991 eight years after it began It is widely believed that the goals were to create a computing environment that would utilize up to 1000 workstations but in fact the goal was to improve the quality of education delivered by the Institute 

The concept that a user could go to any workstation and access any files or applications without finding major differences in the user interface and service just like browsing the Internet today

The project created many technologies that are widely used today such as the X Window System and Kerberos 

A session key is a single use symmetric key used for encrypting all messages in one communication session A closely related term is traffic encryption key or TEK which refers to any symmetric key that is used to encrypt traffic messages Typically TEKs are changed frequently in some systems daily and in others for every message

Session keys introduce complexities in a cryptosystem However they also help with some real problems which is why they are used There are two primary reasons for using session keys

Like all cryptographic keys session keys must be chosen so that they are unpredictable by an attacker In the usual case this means that they must be chosen randomly Failure to choose session keys properly is a major drawback in any cryptosystem 

The Kite Runner is a 2003 book written by Khaled Hosseini

In The Kite Runner Amir and Hassan grow up together in Afghanistan like brothers although they could not be more different Amir is the son of a wealthy businessman a Sunni Muslim a Pashtun He is educated and loves to read and write Hassans father Ali is a servant to Amirs father Hassan is a Shia Muslim and a Hazara He can not read and has a harelip Neither boy has a mother although Babas friend Rahim Kahn has a close friendship with Amir They spend their boyhoods roaming the streets of Kabul together Amir is a selfish friend to Hassan who is devoted and loyal to Amir One day he hides in fear as Hassan is beaten and raped by three bullies led by a boy called Assef when Hassan refuses to give them a kite that he found for Amir After this he cannot bear to talk to Hassan and pretends to his father that Hassan stole his watch so that Hassan will be sent away Although his father forgives Hassan Ali and Hassan decide to leave The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan sends Amir and his father escaping to the United States because Amirs father has been known to curse the Communists Amir is called back to Afghanistan by a terminally ill Rahim Kahn as an adult during the Taliban rule to rescue Hassans son Sohrab when Rahim tells him that he and Hassan are actually brothers because his father secretly had sex with Hassans mother When rescuing Sohrab Amir has to confront Assef who is now a leader of the Taliban He gets severely beaten by Assef and Sohrab eventually saves him by firing a slingshot at Assefs eye He goes home with Amir to live with him and his wife Soraya but does not talk or play Eventually Amir gets Sohrab to smile when he teaches him to fly a kite

The combined oral contraceptive pill often shortened to birth control pill or simply the Pill is a contraceptive for women The pills contain hormones that make the women who take them infertile Women who take the pill will not become pregnant during sexual intercourse they will not have babies if they do not want to When the women stop taking the pills they will usually become fertile again When taken as prescribed the pills are one of the safest means of contraception Women who take the pill will not become pregnant during sexual intercourse they will not have babies if they do not want to

In the 1950s the hormone progesterone was discovered to stop women from making eggs The combined oral contraceptive pill was developed following this find The combined oral contraceptive pill has both female hormones estrogen and progesterone Some oral contraceptive pills have only progesterone These are often known as the minipill

The combined oral contraceptive pill is considered safe and working

The contraceptive method was brought out in the United States in 1960 When a woman uses the Pill in the right way it is are extremely effective at preventing pregnancy At the same time it lets a woman and her man have sexual intercourse whenever they wish without reducing the pleasure of sex During intercourse neither the woman who is using the pill nor the man having sex with her will be conscious of it at all For these reasons the Pill is a very popular method of birth control Different pills exist which are mainly different in the kinds of hormones they use

In 2005 more than 80 million women worldwide used the pill It is the most commonly used method of contraception in the United States Usage varies widely by country age education and marital status

The choice of contraception and whether or not it is available varies by country One quarter of women aged 1649 in United Kingdom were using the Pill as at 2006 compared to only 1 of women in Japan 

Whether or not people use the pill may also be influenced by local culture and habits In some countries women do not really have a choice If they want to use contraception they must rely on one type of contraception In some countries the pill is the most common method offered by national family planning programs In other countries national family planning programs offer only female sterilization or only the IUD intrauterine device

There are different kinds of COCPs There are two main kinds of pills those that contain both estrogen and progesterone or those that contain progesterone only Note that the pills do not contain the hormones themselves but other chemical substances that are very similar but that have been made in the laboratory Estrogen stops the breast from producing milk Women who are breastfeeding should therefore not be given pills that have estrogen in them There are a few other coditions where women should not be given estrogen These women can use the progesterone only pills

There are pills where the concentration of the hormones change from week to week Also the levels of hormones are different in different kinds of pills The same pill may exist with different levels of hormones

Like with most forms of birth control there are two ways to measure how effective COCPs are

Rates are generally presented for the first year of use 

The typical use pregnancy rate among COCP users varies depending on the population being studied It is between 2 and 8 per year The perfect use pregnancy rate of COCPs is 03 per year

There are several reasons why typical use effectiveness is lower than perfect use effectiveness

People might have been given wrong information as to how often the pill should be taken or they might have forgotten to take a pill once or they might not have bothered to go to the pharmacy to get new pills 

COCPs can provide effective contaception if the first pill is taken no later than 5 days after the start of menstruation If the treatment is started at any other time in the menstrual cycle COCPs cannot provide a safe means of contraception for the first 7 days of use During this time other forms of contraception need to be used When active pills have been taken for 7 daysCOCPs can provide effective contaception COCPs should be taken at approximately the same time every day 

Certain things can lower efficiency and protection level

Certain other drugs can interact with COCP and change their effectiveness They also sometimes cause breakthrough bleeding These drugs include

Broad spectrum antibiotics such as ampicillin and doxycycline may cause problems by impairing the bacterial flora responsible for recycling ethinylestradiol from the large bowel 

The traditional medicinal herb St Johns Wort has also been implicated due to its upregulation of the P450 system in the liver

The Pill contains hormones It can therefore also be used to treat a number of problems that result from problems with hormone levels Probably the best known of these conditions are

The pill can also induce menstruation on a regular schedule for women bothered by irregular menstrual cycles and certain disorders where there is dysfunctional uterine bleeding

Women who use combined oral contraceptives have a lesser risk of getting cancer of the ovaries The risk can be reduced by half if the pill is taken for five years Taking the pill also significantly reduces the risk of endometrial cancer by half compared to women who have never taken the pill The risk reduction increases with duration of use However by taking the pill the risk of cancer of the risk of breast and cancer of the cervix is increased

In computer science synchronization refers to one of two different but related concepts synchronization of processes and synchronization of data 

Process synchronization is commonly used to implement Data synchronization

In Computer science client server is a software architecture model consisting of two parts client systems and server systems both communicate over a computer network or on the same computer A client server application is a distributed system consisting of both client and server software The client process always initiates a connection to the server while the server process always waits for requests from any client When both the client process and server process are running on the same computer this is called a single seat setup

Another type of related software architecture is known as peer to peer because each host or application instance can simultaneously act as both a client and a server and because each has equivalent responsibilities and status Peer to peer architectures are often abbreviated using the acronym P2P

The client server relationship describes the relation between the client and how it makes a service request from the server and how the server can accept these requests process them and return the requested information to the client The interaction between client and server is often described using sequence diagrams Sequence diagrams are standardized in the Unified Modeling Language

Both client server and P2P architectures are in wide usage today

The basic type of client server architecture employs only two types of hosts clients and servers This type of architecture is sometimes referred to as two tier The two tier architecture means that the client acts as one tier and server process acts as the other tier

The client server architecture has become one of the basic models of network computing Many types of applications have being written using the client server model Standard networked functions such as E mail exchange web access and database access are based on the client server model For example a web browser is a client program at the user computer that may access information at any web server in the world

Id like to call the communities attention to Bluegoblin7s talk page here and here Hes removed stuff from the navbox under the reason it makes us too much like enWP which is too complicated Also new entries were this morning separate by lines to better separate them He removed them and changed the hidden message When I messaged him about it he again said it makes us too much like enWP which is too complicated but he also added that its hard on the eye and we use that message to much when the edit bar says use sparingly I for one find the lines easier to use in more than one way I discuss how to solve this conflit here Thank you   ChristianMan16 2008 31 October 2008

Did you know that the seeds of the lotus flower have been grown from seeds older than any other plant on record and that its leaves are less sticky than teflon RTG 0042 1 November 2008

I think the next update page is fine so that non admins can prepare for a new update to ensure everything is correct We shouldnt be using the main page as a sandbox to test to see if it looks ok Ive worked extensively on Did You Know on enwiki and the next update page is pretty much essential to the smooth running of it Majorly talk 1616 1 November 2008

Suggest Articles such as Nelumbo could be moved to pages such as Nelumbo so as on pages without pictures or other instantly recognisable info the reader had less chance of being confused by the complex names Most persons seeking the lotus flower article for instance will not be scientists and convention on enwikipedia as I recall is to title articles for maximum chance of search engine hits RTG 0035 1 November 2008

And this is a new trend on the wikipedia because long before I edited anything I looked up Lotus Flower many times and ended up on wikipedia RTG 0040 1 November 2008

Sorry to dig this up but it was just archived as I was editing this page The last thing I wrote was ho hum but I must say that rather than label the projects unworthy of their space it may be a better concensus to keep them under personal guidance whilst activity is low and I would disagree with this but I would concede it also RTG 0038 1 November 2008

We decided about a week ago that we shouldnt have credits for users How about giving TemplateUpdatedDYKNom to users who only nominated hooks and didnt do much work on and TemplateUpdatedDYK if people really worked hard on the article DYK Thoughts RyanCross 2148 1 November 2008

As far as I can tell the Simple English Wikipedia does not have a banning policy Perhaps we should formulate one and add it to WikipediaBlocks and bans We could use the English Wikipedias banning policy for reference Malinaccier 0007 2 November 2008

Wikimedia current operates a Global Bots list Instead of having to request a bot flag on each project a user can request the global flag at Meta and is treated as a bot on all projects which allow global bots Global bots are limited in what they can do they can only deal with interwiki links and double redirect Users requesting the flag on Meta must have it on several individual project first and a history of good contributions before getting the global flag 

Each project that want to allow the global bots must opt in to the process before the bots are allowed on that project Because of this community consensus needs to be reached on if we want to allow this here Most IW bots are already effectively automatically granted the bot flag here if they meet the conditions required for the global so there really would be little change in the process from our point of view There would likely be a drop in bot requests as well as more bots checking us regularly as they no longer would need to go through the application process to work here Overall it is likely we would not even notice any change outwardly but more work would be going on behind the scenes  Creol 0235 2 November 2008

To which role if any should past history at other Wikipedias play in adminship requests Here are some recent examples of this becoming an issue

So the question is should other wiki history ever be a consideration sometimes a consideration or always a consideration And why alexandra 0616 2 November 2008

History on other projects most definately should be taken into account I dislike the fact that there are editors here who quite openly declare that they are banned on enwiki In some cases this is not entirely a bad thing But using us to thumb their noses at enwiki is not on Kennedy 1519 3 November 2008

The blurb about what Wikipedia is seems very condesgending almost as if it is being directed at a two year old It is full of exclamation points What is up with that I understand the need for simplicity of language but overuse of exclamation points is going way too far This unsigned comment was added by 7135188112if  on 2 

Should DYKs be any random article or should DYKs be only content articles Since most of the articles here on simplewikipedia are stubs unlike enwikipedia should we change the rules for DYK to allow any article become a DYK What does the community think RyanCross 0204 4 November 2008

Very basic question Are we discussing that Grfenberg Spot does not meet the criteria for inclusion and should therefore be modified so it can be included or is this about Grfenberg spot being unsuitable for inclusion as some people might be offended by it  Eptalon 1935 5 November 2008

I didnt want to create a debate with what I said in DYK so I think we should vote and forget about it Yotcmdr talk to the commander 1952 5 November 2008

Hi i was thinking wouldnt it be nice if Simple english wikipedia really tried to find good images for our different articles subjects i mean simple english wikipedia will perhaps always be a bit behind in the making of articles but we could be better at fixing photos to our articles Like anything from Jade GoodyNikki Grahame to Neil Entwistle or Olof Palme and United Airlines Flight 93 a whole range of articles etc etc Sinbad 2207 5 November 2008

On the proposal for closure of this project someone has suggested changing the name to accomodate other languages in simple I said I would link it here RTG 0103 7 November 2008

Made a draft page for a proposed process Its important to keep it simple though so the process here will be rather simplified The draft page is here feel free to edit it or make comments on it We do have disputes now and then and having some sort of process for solving them even if its not used often is a good idea I think Talk 0135 7 November 2008

I think its a good idea Ive seen a number of smaller disputes here and some that are ongoing DR is there to tell you how to handle it when it happens Image the time that it begins to happen and there is no process Id rather having something set up right now then to wait until things get so bad that the process and information gets rushed and we have an unworkable system with complex results and measures Synergy 2149 7 November 2008

A lot of the templates here use different standards I think it might be best if we standardise these make them somewhat easier to edit by converting the current templates to ones using the tlambox tlombox etc format Ive started some already if there arent any objections in a day or so Ill continue Talk 0644 7 November 2008

A subculture is a group of people with a culture which makes them different from the larger culture that they belong to known as the dominate culture If a subculture is described as opposing the dominant culture it may be described as a counterculture As Ken Gelder notes subcultures are social with their own shared rules values and rituals but they can also seem self involvedanother thing that makes them different from countercultures

Subcultures can be shown to be different because of the age race ethnicity social class location or gender of the members The qualities that determine a subculture as different from each other may be linguistic aesthetic religious political sexual geographical or a combination of factors Members of a subculture often signal each other through the use of fashion style certain behaviors and use of a secret language created to prevent others not in their group from understanding them They also live out particular relations to places Ken Gelder talks about subcultural geographies along these lines

The study of subcultures often involves the study of symbolism attached to clothing music and other visible things by members of subcultures and also the ways that these same symbols are seen and understood by members of the dominate culture Subcultures have been documented by others for a long time In some casessuch as homeless people criminal gangs or skateboarderssubcultures have had laws created to control or end their activities But subcultures also talk about themselves very often

Controlled natural languages are artificial languages built by simplifying the grammar and reducing the number of words in the language to avoid ambiguity or complexity 

There are two types of controlled languages some designed to help non native speakers of a language and some designed to enable automatic semantic analysis

The first type of languages are used by businesses or industries to improve the quality of technical writing and possibly simplify theautomatic translation to other languages For example the ASD Simplified Technical English Caterpillar Technical English and IBMs Easy English

These languages guide the writer by general rules such as write short and simple sentences use the persons name instead of saying him and talk about who is doing something rather than what is being done unless you need to say what is being done

The second type of languages have a well defined rules of construction and interpretation and can be matched to formal languages such as first order logic Those languages can be used to handle information to support fully automatic checks to test that they are correct and to search for information easily

Existing logic based controlled natural languages include

Other existing controlled natural languages

An artificial language is a language made by people It is usually a natural language cannot be used These languages can be based on an existing language or can be totally made up

If an artificial language does not serve the goal of general purpose communication then it is necessarily a second language

Some types of artificial languages are

The above categories are not exclusive for example it is reasonable to design a computer language for a novel or that a linguistic experiment leads to design a programming language

Benozzo Gozzoli was an Italian Renaissance painter He is most famous for a small chapel that he decorated with frescos of the Procession of the Magi 

Benozzo was born in Florence in about 1420 Nothing is known about his parents or how he started training as an artist The first that is known of him is that in 1444 he was working with the famous sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti who was making the bronze doors for the Baptistry of Florence Cathedral 

In 1447 he started working with the painter Fra Angelico He went to Rome with Fra Angelico to help paint the Chapel of Pope Nicholas V in the Vatican In 1449 he was working in his own studio

For many years Benozzo worked as an assistant to other artists At that time he had to make his style match the style of the master so it is hard to tell his art works apart When Benozzo painted on his own his pictures are rich with many details in the clothing the buildings and the landscape He was extremely good at painting faces and many of the people in his pictures seem to be portraits of real people

Cowra is a city in the central west of New South Wales Australia It is in Cowra Shire It is 310m above sea level and about 300 km west of Sydney Cowra is on the banks of the Lachlan River

The first name for Cowra was Coura Rocks This may have been the name of one of the first cattle farms This name is probably the name of the river ford where people could cross the Lachlan River

The name Cowra comes from a local aboriginal word meaning eagle on the rocks

It should not be confused with another New South Wales town named Corowa

The first people to live in the area were the Wiradjuri people The first European explorer George Wilson Evans came into the Lachlan Valley in 1815 He named the area the Oxley Plains after his boss the Surveyor General John Oxley In 1817 he said the area was unfit for white settlement An army camp was set up soon after at Soldiers Flat near present day Billimari Arthur Ranken and James Sloan from Bathurst were amongst the first European settlers on the Lachlan They moved to the area in 1831

The township of Coura Rocks began in 1840 By 1847 the township was called Cowra The village was officially listed in 1849 

In the 1850s many people looking for gold went through on their way to the gold fields at Lambing Flat and Grenfell The first school was started in 1857 The first bridge over the Lachlan River was built in 1870 Gold was found at Mount McDonald in the 1880s The railway from Sydney reached Cowra in 1886 Local government started in 1888 The first telephone were connected in 1901 The town water supply was started in 1909 the gas in 1912 and town supplied electricity was connected in 1924

Cowra is home to the Australian copy of the United Nations World Peace Bell These are normally kept in a nations capital city It was given to Cowra because of its special role in international understanding world peace and as a centre of world friendship

During World War II Cowra was the site of a prisoner of war camp Most of the prisoners were captured Japanese and Italian soldiers sailors and airmen On August 5 1944 about 545 Japanese POWs attempted a mass escape from the camp This is perhaps the largest prison escape in the world At the same time other Japanese prisoners killed themselves or were killed by their countrymen inside the camp

The POWs tried to capture machine gun posts armed only with home made weapons The Prime Minister John Curtin said this was a suicidal disregard of life and had no chance of success

During the escape 231 Japanese and 4 Australian guards were killed and 108 prisoners were wounded The dead Japanese were buried in Cowra in a specially made Japanese War Cemetery This is the only such cemetery in Australia It also has some of the dead from the WWII air raids on Darwin 

An Avenue of Honour also remembers those who died in World War I

The Japanese War Cemetery was looked by members of the Cowra RSL and given to Japan in 1963 In 1971 the Cowra Tourism Development decided to celebrate this link with Japan They planned a Japanese Garden for the town The Japanese Government agreed to help as a sign of thanks for the respectful treatment of their war dead The garden also received money from the Australian Government and private groups

The garden was designed by Ken Nakajima He was a world famous designer of Japanese gardens The first part was opened in 1979 with a second part opened in 1986

The gardens were built in the style of the Edo period They are a kaiy shiki or strolling garden They are designed to show all of the landscape types of Japan At five hectares the Cowra Japanese Garden is the largest Japanese garden in the Southern Hemisphere An annual Sakura Matsuri is held in the gardens during late September andor early October each year The garden also has other events during the year

Network computing is when computers work together over a network Network computing is Storing andor running applications in servers in a network This means that the network may use the power from all the networked computers to perform complex tasks The network could also be for sharing files so that they can be looked at on any computer in the network easily

Network computing is the opposite to Stand alone computing This is where computers are not connect to a network Most laptops and home computers do their jobs alone and are stand alone computers

A loan is a type of debt The borrower needs to repay the lender the sum of money loaned part by part over time in order to clear the debt

Acting as a provider of loans is one of the main tasks for financial institutions For other institutions issuing of debt contracts such as bonds is a main source of funding Bank loans and credit are one way to increase the money supply

A loan can be broadly described by the following terms

The deposit or down payment is an amount of money that the borrower is required to pay as the first contribution towards clearing the debt so that the loan deal can be finalized The deposit is usually higher than the monthly contribution towards the loan Some loans require a deposit while some do not The deposit is usually a fraction typically a percentage of the total amount that is loaned out

An Installment is money that is a monthly payment towards the loan It may not be necessarily paid monthly but it has to be paid from time to time over throughout the loan deal Installments are paid according to a loan rate 

Interest is a charge on top of the value of the loan that acts as a cost of the loan Interest is paid according to a rate called an interest rate The interest rate varies from loan to loan and from lender to lender

Loans can be broadly classified as either secured or unsecured loans

Secured loans are loans for which the borrower is required to guarantee Repayment by pledging with property for instancea car a house etc This property is called security or collateral Because of the pledging secured loans are given in larger amounts and have lower interest rates However there is a risk of loosing the property used as security in the event that the loan is not paid off An Examples of a Secured loans is mortgage

Unsecured loans are loans that are given without pledges of repayment This means that the borrower is not required to provide security to get the loan Because of the high risk involved unsecured loans are given out in smaller amounts and have higher interest rates The lenders raise the interest rates in an effort to recover their money as quickly as possible Most personal loans are unsecured loans

A personal loan is a small expense loan that is mostly used by people to finance their day to day emergencies They come in smaller amounts and therefore just like most unsecured loans they are easily approved

Home loans are loans that are taken for the purpose of buying a house Home loans are secured loans The house acts as a collateral or security to the loan 

Payday loans are the easiest loans to get if you are employed They are signature loans or cash advances that requires no security This means that it is possible to get a payday loan even with a bad credit status or no credit at all Payday loans are given on the basis of employment and income

However payday loans have a high interest rate especially when the paying schedule is not followed The high interest rates are a cost of convenience Interest could run as high as 2000 for this reason it is not a good idea to take a payday loan if you dont expect a salary

Auto loans are loans given out by financial institutions or car dealerships for the purpose of buying an automobile Due to the nature of automobiles to loose value with time Auto loans usually have high interest rates The shorter the time an auto loan is paid the lower the overall cost of the loan

Mortgage is a loan that is used specifically to purchase a house Usually a mortgage is given to you by a mortgage company or any financial institution after evaluation of your potential to pay back the loan in full A mortgage is a secured loan therefore providing collateral is necessary Mortgage can be further classified into long term and short term mortgages depending on the length of time required for the mortgage to be paid Short term mortgages usually have a term of 15 years while long term mortgages have a 30 year term

When you get a credit card you have taken a loan This is a credit card loan and just like any other loan it comes with interest and fees Credit card loans are given out by credit companies and most banks today The interest rates on credit card loans are higher than that on most personal loans often around 16 

A mortgage is a way to use ones real property like land a house or a building as a guarantee for a loan to get money Many people do this to buy the home they use for mortgage the loan provides them the money to buy the house and the loan is guaranteed by the house

In a mortgage there is a debtor and a creditor The debtor is the owner of the property while the creditor is the owner of the loan When the mortgage transaction is made the debtor gets the money with the loan and promises to pay the loan The creditor will receive money back with interest over time If the debtor does not pay the loan the creditor may take the mortgaged property in place of the loan This is called foreclosure

In the 2008 American economic failure creditors lent money to debtors who could not pay back that money This lowered housing prices and hurt the economy

The borrower promises to repay the borrowed money on a certain date The borrower transfers the property to the lender The lender will retransfer the property when the money is repaid

A reverse mortgage is a loan where the lender pays the monthly installments to the borrower instead of the borrower paying the lender The payment stream is reversed A reverse mortgage allows people to get tax free income from the value of their home They are mainly to improve older peoples personal and financial independence

The takes the property The lender receives income from the property until the money is paid back The owner keeps the title deeds

In computer network and computer science digital bandwidth or just bandwidth is the capacity for a given system to transfer data over a connection It is measured as a bit rate expressed in bits per second or multiples of it 

Digital bandwidth should not be confused with

In web hosting the term bandwidth is often used to describe the amount of data transferred to or from the website within a defined period of time Another more specific phrase used for this meaning of bandwidth is monthly data transfer

Web hosting companies often quote a monthly data transfer for a website for example 500 gigabytes per month If the total amount of data downloaded from the website in a particular month reaches this limit the hosting company may shut off further public access to the site

In mathematics a Riemann sum is a sum that makes an approximation of the total area underneath a curve on a graph The area can be known as the integral It may also be used to define the integration operation The sum is named after a German mathematician who was called Bernhard Riemann

The Beatitudes are a list of traits that Christians should follow Some of these include humbleness meekness and other important lessons to follow Jesus Christ taught these ideas to think and act according to as The first Lesson in a three lesson sermon called The sermon on The Mount

Asceticism is a word that describes a certain life style This life style is different from others mainly because those who practice it abstain from various sorts of worldly pleasures especially sexual activity and drinking of alcohol Often their aim is to follow religious and spiritual goals Christianity and the Indian religions teach that salvation and liberation involve a process of mind body transformation that is done through practicing restraint with respect to actions of body speech and mind The founders and earliest practitioners of these religions lived extremely austere lifestyles They rejected sensual pleasures and the accumulation of material wealth This is to be understood not as an eschewal of the enjoyment of life but a recognition that spiritual and religious goals are impeded by such indulgence Asceticism is closely related to the Christian concept of chastity and might be said to be the technical implementation of the abstract vows of renunciation Those who practice ascetic lifestyles do not consider their practices as virtuous but pursue such a life style in order to satisfy certain technical requirements for mind body transformation There is remarkable uniformity among the above religions with respect to the benefits of sexual continence Religions teach that purifying the soul also involves purification of the body which thereby enables connection with the Divine and the cultivation of inner peace In the popular imagination asceticism is considered a sort of perversion but the asksis enjoined by religion functions in order to bring about greater freedom in various areas of ones life such as freedom from compulsions and temptations bringing about peacefulness of mind with a concomitant increase in clarity and power of thought

St Marks in Florence Italy is a church and Domincan convent The church also has the Museum of St Mark which shows paintings by Fra Angelico 

The Domincan Convent was begun in the early 1400s The first prior was St Antoninus of Florence The famous painter known as Fra Angelico was one of the first of the Dominican Friars to live and work there He later became the prior The land for the convent was given to the friars by Cosimo Medici The monks lived in small rooms called cells Cosimo had a cell built for himself where he could stay sometimes Between 1447 and 1452 Cosimo got his favourite architect Michelozzo to build a large new library and improve other parts of the building In the late 1700s the facade of the building was rebuilt in a Classical style 

In 1490 the prior of St Marks was a famous Domincan called Savonarola He lived in the cell that had once belonged to Cosimo Medici He was a great preacher He disliked Cosimos grandson Lorenzo Medici who was often called Lorenzo the Magnificent He thought that Lorenzo had too much power and was acting like a prince He preached against Lorenzo against the Pope and against the Roman Catholic Church He told everyone that the end of the world was near Many people became frightened or depressed by the things that he said Pope Alexander VI had Savonarola arrested He was tortured and put to death in 1498 60 years later the Church agreed that in fact he had said nothing wrong 

Treasures The Library of St Marks contains many illuminated manuscripts Some were probably decorated by Fra Angelicos brother Benedetto Some may even have been painted by Fra Angelico 

The Museum has a collection of paintings by Fra Angelico On of the most famous is The Descent from the Cross which shows the body of Jesus being taken down from the cross where he was crucified The convent also contains many paintings by Fra Angelico They are frescos and decorated many walls including a painting in each friars cell 

Another famous fresco is The Last Supper painted in the refectory by Domenico Ghirlandaio

Afro Asian or Blasian means a person of mixed race Black African and East Asian 

Ethiopians went to South Arabia in the 2nd century and the 4th century By 532 AD they had invaded Yemen After this many more Africans came to South Arabia as slaves men were usually traded and the women were kept as servants for the Arab leaders Mixed race children were more valuable in South Arabia Two such children became Princes of the Abbassids At this time the Arabian army known as the Sabaens moved to Ethiopia In Iraq Bantu speaking Africans were called Zanj The large number of Zanj slaves working in bad conditions in Iraq lead to the famous Zanj Rebellion over fifteen years African rebels took over many of Iraqs cities forcing Arabs to flee to African nations such as Kenya Somalia and Tanzania Today someone of African and Arab descent is considered Afro Arab

A former slave by the name of Najah seized power in the 10th century and established the Banu Najah dynasty the first royal Afro Asian family

As early as 1100 AD African slaves were brought to India by Arab merchants in medieval times from the Bantu speaking parts of eastern Africa These Africans became known as Siddi or Habshi Arabic word meaning Black African Today marriage has made the Siddi population in India much smaller Someone of Indian and African background is considered an Indo African In South Asia there are over 15000 individuals who identify as Afro Asian

In 1882 the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed and Chinese workers who chose to stay in the US could no longer be with their wives who stayed behind in China Because White Americans looked at Chinese labor workers as stealing jobs they were treated badly Many Chinese men settled in black communities and in turn married black women

Tiger Woods a famous golf player is of white Chinese Native American Thai and black descent his father being half African American and his mother being half Thai RB singer Amerie is another famous Afro Asian American with her father being black and her mother Korean Hines Ward an NFL football player is also an Afro Asian He currently plays for the Pittsburgh Steelers

As of the census of 2000 there were 106782 Afro Asian individuals in the United States

In the 1860s Chinese people were imported for labor and trade It became more common for a Chinese man to marry a black woman since there was more black women than Chinese women According to the 1946 Census 12394 Chinese were located between Jamaica and Trinidad 5515 of those who lived in Jamaica were Chinese Jamaican and another 3673 were Chinese Trinidadians living in Trinidad In Guyana and Haiti there is also a very small percentage within the minority who are of Asian descent

Haitian painter Edouard Wah was born to a Chinese father and Haitian mother Grace Jones is also part Chinese FactdateMarch 2008

The UK has a large mixed race population which is about 14 of the population The largest groups are mixed Whites and Black and mixed Whites and Asians However there are over 70000 UK citizens that are mixed race and do not fit the above descriptions a large percentage of these are Afro Asian Famous Afro Asian Britons include Naomi Campbell David Jordan

In cryptography RC6 is a symmetric key block cipher derived from RC5 RC6 is a parameterized algorithm with a variable block size a variable key size and a variable number of rounds RC stands for Rivest Cipher or alternatively Rons Code

In 1997 the NIST announced a competition to choose a successor to Data Encryption Standard to be known as Advanced Encryption Standard RC6 was derived from RC5 to meet the competition requirements and was selected as one of the five finalists of the Advanced Encryption Standard competition but was not selected as a standard

In order to provide varieties of security and efficiency levels RC6 allows choices for the block size 32 bits 64 bits and 128 bits The number of rounds can range from 0 to 255 while the key sizes can range from 0 bits to 2040 bits in size 

RC6 is very similar to RC5 in structure and could be viewed as interweaving two parallel RC5 encryption processes However RC6 does use an extra multiplication operation not present in RC5 and the use of four b4 bit working registers instead of two b2 bit registers as in RC5 Integer multiplication is used to increase the diffusion achieved per round so that fewer rounds are needed and the speed of the cipher can be increasedThe reason for using four working registers instead of two is mainly for optimization on 32 bit CPUs The default block size of RC5 was 64 bits while the default block size of the AES is 128 bits RC5 has only two working registers It uses 32 bit operations when dealing with 64 bit blocks and 64 bit operations when dealing with 128 bit blocks so four working registers are required to build the AES architecture using only 32 bit operations

RC6 is a proprietary and patented algorithm and may require licensing and royalty payments for any products using the algorithm It was designed by Ron Rivest Matt Robshaw Ray Sidney and Yiqun Lisa Yin and was also submitted to the NESSIE and CRYPTREC projects

In cryptography RC5 is a simple symmetric key block cipher Designed by Ronald Rivest in 1994 RC5 is a parameterized algorithm with a variable block size a variable key size and a variable number of rounds RC stands for Rivest Cipher or alternatively Rons Code

In order to provide varieties of security and efficiency levels RC5 has a variable block size variable key size and variable number of rounds The original suggested choice of parameters were a block size of 64 bits a 128 bit key and 12 rounds 

A key feature of RC5 is the use of data dependent rotations one of the goals of RC5 was to study and evaluate operations of block ciphers as a cryptographic primitive RC5 also consists of a number of modular additions and eXclusive ORs The general structure of the algorithm is a Feistel like network The encryption and decryption routines can be specified in a few lines of code The key schedule however is more complex expanding the key using an essentially one way function with the binary expansions of both e and the golden ratio as sources of nothing up my sleeve numbers The simplicity of the algorithm together with the novelty of the data dependent rotations has made RC5 an attractive subject to study by cryptanalysts

12 round RC5 is susceptible to a differential attack using 244 chosen plaintexts 1820 rounds are suggested as sufficient protection

RSA Security which has a patent on the algorithm offered a series of US10000 prizes for breaking ciphertexts encrypted with RC5 but these contests have been discontinued as of May 2007 A number of these challenge problems have been tackled using distributed computing organised by Distributednet Distributednet has brute forced RC5 messages encrypted with 56 and 64 bit keys and now is working on cracking a 72 bit key At the current rate it will take approximately 1000 years to test every possible key to complete the project

Altaic is suggested as a language family It would include 66 languages that are spoken by about 348 million people mostly in and around Central Asia and northeast Asia

According to the best known classification of Altaic it consists of the Turkic Mongolic and Tungusic language families It is probably fair to say that this is the meaning attributed to Altaic by most general linguists 

However since the publication of Gustaf John Ramstedts Einfhrung in 19521957 most Altaicists have included Korean in Altaic Since the publication of Roy Andrew Millers Japanese and the Other Altaic Languages in 1971 most have also included Japanese or better Japonic consisting of Japanese and Ryukyuan 

A few linguists even count Ainu with the Altaic languages but as part of a node including Korean and Japanese in contradistinction to a Turkic Mongolic Tungusic node with Korean Japanese Ainu and Turkic Mongolic Tungusic in turn forming a node at a higher level 

The core version of Altaic consisting of Turkic Mongolic and Tungusic is sometimes referred to as Micro Altaic while the expanded version including Korean or Korean and Japanese is referred to as Macro Altaic 

The Mongolian language is the best known member of the Mongolic language family and the language of most of the residents of Mongolia where it is officially written with the Cyrillic alphabet and of around three million Mongolian speakers in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China where it is officially written with the traditional Mongolian script It is also spoken in some areas in the Russian Far East and Kyrgyzstan The majority of speakers in Mongolia speak the Khalkha dialect while those in China speak one of many Inner Mongolian dialects 

In cryptography RC2 is a symmetric key block cipher Designed by Ronald Rivest in 1987 RC stands for Rivest Cipher or alternatively Rons Code

RC2 is a 64 bit block cipher with a variable key size and using 18 rounds

Rounds are arranged as a source heavy feistel network with 16 rounds of one type called mixing rounds interleaved by two rounds of another type called mashing rounds 

The 18 rounds are performed using the following interleaved sequence 

RC2 uses key expansion algorithm by which an expanded key consisting of 64 is produces depending in a complicated way on every bit of the supplied variable length input key A mixing round consists of four applications of the mix up transformation as shown in the diagram A round is mashed by adding to it one of the 16 bit words of the expanded key 

RC2 is susceptible to a related key attack using 234 chosen plaintext attacks

The development of RC2 was sponsored by Lotus who were seeking a custom cipher be exported as part of their Lotus Notes software after evaluation by the NSA The NSA suggested a couple of changes which Ronald Rivest incorporated After further negotiations the cipher was approved for export in 1989 

Along with RC4 RC2 with a 40 bit key size was treated under US export regulations for cryptography Now all 40 bit encryption algorithms are obsolete because they are dangerously susceptible to brute force attacks

Initially the details of the algorithm were kept secret proprietary to RSA Security but on 29th January 1996 source code for RC2 was anonymously posted to the Internet on the Usenet forum scicrypt A similar post had occurred earlier with RC4 It is unclear whether the poster had access to the specifications or whether it had been reverse engineered

The 1999 East Timorese crisis was a conflict Militia who did not like the independence in East Timor started the conflict when they attacked civilians These attacks led to more violence all over the country Most of the violence occurred in the capital Dili 

The violence started after the result of an election was independence from Indonesia About 1400 people are thought to have died An UN force made up mainly of people from the Australian Defence Force was sent to East Timor to establish and maintain peace

In 1999 there was a lot of pressure on Indonesia Therefore the Indonesian government decided to hold a vote In this referendum it asked the people of East Timor whether they wanted to stay with Indonesia or become independent Portugal had done some lobbying The referendum was held on August 30 In it a clear majority of those voting said they would rather become independentfactdateJuly 2010 The alternative proposal would have been to stay with Indonesia but to have many freedoms as an autonomous province called Special Autonomous Region of East Timor

Directly after the referendum violence broke out The violence came from Indonesian soldiers and from a special East Timorese pro integration militia which was supported by Indonesia These troops became violent and terrorised the population They did not like how the people had voted About 14000 Timorese people were killed 300000 had to flee to West Timor to live as refugees Most of the infrastructure of the country including houses watering systems and the electricity was destroyed Noam Chomsky said In one month this massive military operation murdered some 2000 people raped hundreds of women and girls displaced three quarters of the population and demolished 75 percent of the countrys infrastructure

On 20 September 1999 the Australian led peacekeeping troops of the International Force for East Timor came to the country This ended the violence Activists in Portugal Australia the United States and elsewhere pressured their governments to take action US President Bill Clinton eventually threatened Indonesia that the IMF loans would be stopped Indonesia was in deep economic troubles already The Indonesian government agreed to withdraw its troops and allowed a multinational force into Timor to stabilize the area It was clear that the UN did not have sufficient resources to fight the paramilitary forces directly Instead the UN authorised the creation of a multinational military force known as INTERFET with Security Council Resolution 1264 17 nations sent troops about 9900 people in total 4400 came from Australia the remainder mostly from South East Asia The force was led by Major General Peter Cosgrove Troops landed in East Timor on 20 September 1999

Godiva was an Anglo Saxon noblewoman There are legends that say that she rode naked through the streets of Coventry in England She did this so her husband would lower the taxes on his tenants The name Peeping Tom for a voyeur comes from later versions of this legend In these versions man named Tom had watched her ride and was struck blind or dead

A scandal is a very public incident which involves a claim of wrong doing shame or moral offence A scandal may be about a real event an untrue event or a mixture of both Something which is a scandal can be described as scandalous

Scandals may be told by broken wikt linkwhistleblowerwhistleblowers who have access to secrets and allow them to go public A well known scandal was the Watergate scandal in which US President Richard Nixon was found to be supporting and hiding illegal burglaries Untrue claims often lead to a loss of respect for that person and can destroy their careers Sometimes an attempt to cover up a scandal creates a bigger scandal when the cover up does not succeed

Manchester is a place in England In 2001 there were over 450000 people a population that makes it the 5th largest city in the United Kingdom

It is a city and metropolitan borough of Greater Manchester England Manchester was given city status in 1853 As of 2001 Manchester has a population of English district populationONS00BN The city is in the middle of the Greater Manchester Urban Area which has 2240230 people and is the United Kingdoms third largest built up place 

Manchester is a very important city in England and is called the second city of the UK It has also been called the Capital of the North Manchester has many places for the arts places for learning businesses providing media as well as lots of shops In a poll of British managers in 2006 Manchester was named the best place in Britain to have a business A report in 2007 said Manchester is a fast growing city Manchester was the host of the 2002 Commonwealth Games Manchester United and Manchester City are football teams in the area

Manchester was the first place to have big industry because of the Industrial Revolution It was the main place for making cloth and fabric During the 19th century it had the nickname Cottonopolis because it had so many cotton mills The middle of Manchester is important because it is on UNESCOs World Heritage Sites because of its network of canals and mills built during its 19th century development

In the late 1700s Manchester was only a small village with a low population This changed at the start of the Industrial Revolution During this time there were revolts about the living conditions for workers The most well known of these revolts was the Peterloo Massacre Fifteen to twenty people were killed during the Peterloo Massacre and hundreds of other people were hurt In 1780 Richard Arkwright built the first cotton mill in the area

Later in the 1800s Manchester became most important cotton town in the world It was also the first industrialised city meaning that it was the first city to have a big amount of industry in it Only a small amount of cloth is still made in the city and the trade has mainly stopped This left a big number of old buildings from that time including the Town Hall Free Trade Hall and Central Library and left a lot of other buildings empty

The Manchester Ship Canal was created by the digging of canals in the rivers Irwell and Mersey for convert36mikm0 from Salford to the Mersey estuary This let ocean going ships sail into the Port of Manchester

The county of Greater Manchester was made in 1974 The county was created from cities and towns in southern Lancashire and northern Cheshire and some mainly rural districts of Derbyshire and Yorkshire

In 1996 the Irish Republican Army put a bomb in a truck located in the centre of the city Nobody was killed but it did a lot of damage

Manchester is located convert160mikm0lkon north west of Englands capital London The city has many canals and rivers which were a big part in its earlier growth The largest open space in the city is Heaton Park It has an area of about convert618acreha0lkon Heaton Park is a place that attracts many people every year People go there to see the many animals and the beauty of the countryside Much of Manchester is built up Much of Manchesters rain comes over from the Pennines which are a hilly range to the south and east of the city The city is mainly urban areas but also has some areas which are mainly of farmland To the south of the centre is Manchester Airport This is the third largest airport in the United Kingdom

A revival of the citys importance started in the 1980s This was partly led by a vibrant music scene whose spirit was labelled Madchester which was led by bands such as The Happy Mondays and Joy Division It was also partly fuelled by the big number of students attending the number of universities and further education colleges in the city Manchester has the highest population of students in the United Kingdom in term time

The largest university in the UK the University of Manchester is located in the city It has over 30000 students It also has the fourth largest university the Manchester Metropolitan University

The city has two Premier League football teams Manchester City and Manchester United Football is a very important part of the culture of the city Many of the population support or show interest in the sport

Manchester and North West England are served by Manchester Airport The airport has the most passengers in the UK outside London with 221 million passengers in 2007 Planes fly to lots of broken wikt linkdestinationsdestinations in Europe North America the Caribbean Africa the Middle East and Asia

Manchester is very well served by train and in terms of passengers Manchester Piccadilly was the busiest English train station outside London in 2005 and 2006 Northern Rail operates all over the north of England and other operators include Virgin Trains The Liverpool and Manchester Railway was the first passenger railway in the world Greater Manchester has a very big railway network The city centre has over a lot of park and ride sites Manchester became the first city in the UK to get a new tram system when the Manchester Metrolink opened in 1992 There are lots of new lines being built 

The city has one of the biggest bus networks outside London with over 50 bus companies operating in the Greater Manchester area around the city First Manchester and Stagecoach Manchester are the main bus operators First Manchester also operates three free bus services called Metroshuttle which carry workers around Manchesters business areas

A big canal network runs though the city built in the Industrial Revolution today mainly used for leisure The Manchester Ship Canal is open but not many boats use it

Manchesters buildings display many different types of building styles from Victorian to contemporary architecture The very common use of red bricks characterises the look of the city Much of the architecture in the city dates back to its days as a global centre for the trade of cotton Just outside the city centre is a large number of former cotton mills some of which have been left mostly untouched since they were closed while many others have been turned into apartment buildings and office spacesManchester Town Hall in Albert Square was built in the gothic revival style and is thought of by many to be one of the most important Victorian buildings in all of England

There are two universites in the City of Manchester The University of Manchester created in 2004 when Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST were combined is the largest full time non collegiate university in the United Kingdom The Manchester Business School located at the University of Manchester was the first school to offer an MBA course in the United Kingdom in 1965 Manchester Metropolitan University was created as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970 It was given university status in 1992 and in the same year combined with Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education located in South Cheshire

Manchester has twinning plans with lots of places In addition the British Council has a metropolitan centre in Manchester Although not an official twin city Tampere Finland is known as the Manchester of Finland or Manse for short Also Ahmedabad India became the centre of a booming textile industry and it got the nickname the Manchester of the East

There have been nine goaltenders who have scored a goal in a National Hockey League game The most recent to do so was Chris Mason in 2006 who was credited with a goal after he was the last player to touch the puck before his opponents put the puck into their own net The most recent goaltender to have scored a goal by actually shooting the puck into his opponents net was Evgeni Nabokov in 2002

A cryptographic protocol is an abstract or an existing protocol that performs a security related function and applies cryptographic methods 

A protocol describes how the cryptographic algorithms should be used to secure information The description of a protocol must include details about all data structures and representations and all details about how to utilize the protocol by programs

Cryptographic protocols are widely used for secure application level data transport in order to secure transferred messages A cryptographic protocol usually has at least some of these features

The term cryptographic protocol is used in different ways For example cryptographic application protocols often use one or more underlying Key agreement protocols which are also sometimes themselves referred to as cryptographic protocols like the Secure Sockets Layer which uses what is known as the Diffie Hellman key exchange Diffie Hellman may be seen as a complete cryptographic protocol in itself for other applications

Religious persecution means unfair treatment of a particular group of people because of their religion Religious persecution may occur in the following forms

At present Iran and India are two countries where incidents of religious persecution are periodically reported For example in case of India the United States Department of State in its annual human rights report for 2006 noted attacks against the people of religious groups who are small in number State Departments annual reports on religious freedom for 2007 expressed concern over organized societal attacks against religious minority in India Some state governments in India have been accused of not effectively prosecuting those who attack religious minorities In Iran Bah Faith is banned

Persecution of Christians is treating Christians unfairly based on their religion This can mean using violence against them or putting them in prison Persecution of Christians exists in many countries which include India Iran Pakistan Nigeria Afghanistan Burma Lebanon Syria Sri Lanka etc

Religious violence means violence against a group of people of one religion by a group of people of another region This type of violence is religiously motivated 

The September 11 attacks are example of religious violence In India incident of religious violence have periodically occurred since independence the United States Department of State in its annual human rights report for 2006 noted attacks against the people of religious groups who are small in number State Departments annual reports on religious freedom for 2007 expressed concern over organized societal attacks against religious minority in India Some state governments in India have been accused of not effectively prosecuting those who attack religious minorities

In a witch hunt people looked for witches or evidence that witchcraft was done In earlier times people could be blamed for witchcraft they were then taken to court charged with it and punished for it In the Catholic Church punishment for witchcraft was death

Today most countries no longer allow a person to be blamed for witchcraft there are no more witch hunts in the strict sense

When there still were witch hunts often involved moral panic mass hysteria and mob lynching That way priests would often make a bad feeling in the crowd those who were a little different might then be seen as witches

The time when the witch hunts were most common in Europe is during the Early Modern period from about 1480 to 1700 This is the time when there was the Protestant Reformation and the Thirty Years War During this time tens of thousands of people were executed as witches

Most cultures have reacted to witchcraft in one of two ways

Today witch hunts still occur in many communities where religious values are strong and where these values condemn whichcraft and other occult practices

Today the term witch hunt is mostly used to refer to similar practices where worried people look for wrong doers which are of course not witches The best known example is probably the McCarthyist search for communists during the Cold War which was discredited partly through being compared to the Salem witch trials

Responsible government is a principle of some democratic governments It has nothing to do with the question of whether a government has responsibility

In the government of a country that uses responsible government the leaders of the executive branch of government are also members of the legislature Also the cabinet must have the support of the majority of the legislature to stay in power If it loses the support of the legislature there will be an election or a different political party will make a new cabinet

Countries that use responsible government usually have parliamentary systems of government Some examples of countries that have responsible government are the United Kingdom Canada and Australia

In countries that do not have responsible government the cabinet and the legislature are each elected separately This system has more separation of powers than a system with responsible government Some examples of countries that do not have a system of responsible government are the United States and France

The theory known as spontaneous generation held that complex living organisms are generated by decaying organic substances Mice might spontaneously appear in stored grain or maggots could spontaneously appear in meat

According to Aristotle it was a readily observable truth that aphids arise from the dew which falls on plants fleas from putrid matter mice from dirty hay crocodiles from logs rotting at the bottom of bodies of water and se same timo forth In the 17th century these things started to be questioned Sir Thomas Browne wrote a book called Pseudodoxia Epidemica He subtitled it Enquiries into Very many Received Tenets and Commonly Presumed Truths He published it in 1646 He wrote it as an attack on false beliefs and vulgar errors Scientists failed to accept the conclusions he reached That way Alexander Ross a scientist who lived at the same time as Browne wrote about it To question this he meant spontaneous generation is to question reason sense and experience If he doubts of this let him go to Egypt and there he will find the fields swarming with mice begot of the mud of Nylus to the great calamity of the inhabitants

In 1546 the physician Girolamo Fracastoro theorized that epidemic diseases were caused by tiny invisible particles or spores which might not be living creatures but this was not widely accepted Next Robert Hooke published the first drawings of a microorganism in 1665 He is also credited for naming the cell which he discovered while observing cork samples

In 1676 Anthony van Leeuwenhoek discovered microorganisms that were probably protozoa and bacteria This sparked new interest in the microscopic world 

The first step was taken by the Italian Francesco Redi In 1668 Redi proved that no maggots appeared in meat when flies were prevented from laying eggs From the 17th century onwards it was gradually shown that at least in the case of all the higher and readily visible organisms the previous sentiment regarding spontaneous generation was false The alternative seemed to be omne vivum ex ovo that every living thing came from a pre existing living thing 

In 1768 Lazzaro Spallanzani proved that microbes came from the air and could be killed by boiling Yet it was not until 1861 that Louis Pasteur performed a series of careful experiments With these experiments Pasteur proved that organisms such as bacteria and fungi do not appear in nutrient rich media of their own accord in non living material This experiment supported cell theory

In Computer science Cloud computing is a marketing term In the case of electricity users can simply use it They do not need to worry where the electricity is from how it is generated or transported At the end of the month they will get a bill for the amount of electricity they consumed

The idea behind cloud computing is similar The user can simply use storage computing power or specially crafted development environments without having to worry how these work internally Cloud computing is a systems architecture model for Internet based computing It is the development and use of computer technology on the Internet The cloud is a metaphor for the Internet based on how the internet is described in computer network diagrams which means it is an abstraction hiding the complex infrastructure of the internet It is a style of computing in which IT related capabilities are provided as a service allowing users to access technology enabled services from the Internet without knowledge of or control over the technologies behind these servers 

According to a paper published by IEEE Internet Computing in 2008 Cloud Computing is a paradigm in which information is permanently stored in servers on the Internet and cached temporarily on clients that include computers laptops handhelds sensors etc

Cloud computing is a general concept that utilizes software as a service such as Web 20 and other technology trends all of which depend on the Internet for satisfying users needs For example Google Apps provides common business applications online that are accessed from a web browser while the software and data are stored on the Internet servers 

Cloud computing is often confused with grid computing utility computing and autonomic computing 

Many cloud computing deployments are today powered by grids have autonomic characteristics and are billed like utilities but cloud computing can be seen as a natural next step from the grid utility model Some successful cloud architectures have little or no centralised infrastructure or billing systems at all including peer to peer networks like BitTorrent and Skype

The majority of cloud computing infrastructure currently consists of reliable services delivered through data centers that are built on computer and storage virtualization technologies The services are accessible anywhere in the world with The Cloud appearing as a single point of access for all the computing needs of consumers Commercial offerings need to meet the quality of service requirements of customers and typically offer service level agreements Open standards and open source software are also critical to the growth of cloud computing

As customers generally do not own the infrastructure or know all details about it mainly they are accessing or renting so they can consume resources as a service and may be paying for what they do not need instead of what they actually do need to use Many cloud computing providers have adopted the utility computing model which is analogous to how traditional public utilities like electricity are consumed while others are billed on a subscription basis By sharing consumable and intangible computing power between multiple tenants utilization rates can be improved which can reduce costs significantly while increasing the speed of application development A side effect of this approach is that computer capacity rises dramatically as customers do not have to engineer for peak loads Adoption has been enabled by increased high speed bandwidth which makes it possible to receive the same response times from centralized infrastructure at other sites

Cloud computing is being driven by providers including Google Amazoncom and Yahoo as well as traditional vendors including IBM Intel Microsoft and SAP It is adopted from individual users through large enterprises as General Electric

The Cloud is a metaphor for the Internet or more generally components and services which are managed by others

The underlying concept dates back to 1960 when John McCarthy expressed his opinion that computation may someday be organized as a public utility and the term Cloud was already in commercial use in the early 1990s to refer to large ATM networks By the turn of the 21st century cloud computing solutions had started to appear on the market though most of the focus at this time was on Software as a service

Amazoncom played a key role in the development of cloud computing when upgrading their data centers after the dot com bubble and providing access to their systems by way of Amazon Web Services in 2002 on a utility computing basis They found the new cloud architecture resulted in significant internal efficiency improvements

2007 observed increased activity including Google IBM and a number of universities starting large scale cloud computing research project around the time the term started gaining popularity in the mainstream press It was a hot topic by mid 2008 and numerous cloud computing events had been scheduled

In August 2008 Gartner observed that organisations are switching from company owned hardware and software assets to per use service based models and that the projected shift to cloud computing will result in dramatic growth in IT products in some areas and in significant reductions in other areas

Clouds cross many countries borders and may be the ultimate form of globalisation As such it is the subject of complex geopolitical issues whereby providers must satisfy many legal restrictions in order to deliver service to a global market This dates back to the early days of the Internet where libertarian thinkers felt that cyberspace was a distinct place calling for laws and legal institutions of its own author Neal Stephenson envisaged this as a tiny island data haven called Kinakuta in his science fiction classic novel Cryptonomicon

Although there have been efforts to match the legal environment providers like Amazon Web Services are currently dealing with international markets by deploying local infrastructure and allowing customers to select their countries However there are still concerns about security and privacy from individual through governmental level

In March 2007 Dell applied to trademark the term cloud computing in the United States It received a Notice of Allowance in July 2008 which was subsequently canceled on August 6 resulting in a formal rejection of the trademark application in less than a week later

In November 2007 the Free Software Foundation released the Affero General Public License a version of GPLv3 designed to close a perceived legal loophole associated with Free software designed to be run over a network particularly software as a service According to the AGPL license application service providers are required to release any changes they make to an AGPL open source code

Cloud architecture is the systems architecture of the software systems involved in the delivery of cloud computing as designed by a cloud architect who typically works for a cloud integrator It typically involves multiple cloud components communicating with each other over application programming interfaces

This is very similar to the Unix philosophy of having multiple programs doing one thing well and working together over universal interfaces Complexity is controlled and the resulting systems are more manageable than their monolithic counterparts

Cloud architecture extends to the client where web browsers andor software applications are used to access cloud applications

Cloud storage architecture is loosely coupled where metadata operations are centralized enabling the data nodes to scale into the hundreds each independently delivering data to applications or users

Avant garde music or experimental music is a type of music that is meant to push the boundaries of what music is It started in the 1940s and 1950s after World War II Some famous avant garde composers were John Cage Karlheinz Stockhausen and Henry Cowell

This was a song written by John Cage that is 4 minutes and 33 seconds of complete silence It is meant to make the audience listen to the sounds around them

This is a song by the popular English rock band The Beatles It appeared on their album The Beatles also known as The White Album Revolution 9 is over 8 minutes of random sounds and someone repeatedly saying number 9number 9number 9number 9 It was mostly the work of John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono

This is a song by the American grunge band Pearl Jam It is the last song on their third album Vitalogy released in 1994 It is over seven minutes long It is made up of conversations between mental patients in asylums and psychiatrists with distorted bass guitar and drums laid over them

The Red Deer Cervus elaphus is one of the largest deer species The Red Deer lives in most of Europe the Caucasus Mountains region Asia Minor and parts of western and central Asia in Kashmir as the state animal They can also be found in the Atlas Mountains region between Algeria and Tunisia in northwestern Africa They are the only species of deer in Africa Red Deer have been introduced to other areas including Australia New Zealand and Argentina In many parts of the world the meat from Red Deer is widely used as a food source

Lisa Gerrard is an Australian musician singer and composer who rose to fame as part of the group Dead Can Dance with former music partner Brendan Perry 

Gerrard received a Golden Globe award and an Academy Award nomination for the score for the 2000 film Gladiator on which she teamed up with Hans Zimmer

Lisa Gerrards vocals have been variously described as rich jaw dropping deep dark mournful and unique Her vocal range is contralto 1 note E3 F5  She extends into the dramatic mezzo soprano range on The Host of Seraphim Elegy Space Weaver and Come This Way Gerrard performs in the dramatic contralto range on the other songs Sanvean Sacrifice Largo and Not Yet

Gerrard sings many of her songs such as Now We Are Free Come Tenderness Serenity The Valley of the Moon Tempest Pilgrimage of Lost Children Coming Home and Sanvean in an idioglossia that she has developed since the age of twelve

The stop sign is a sign which is often met at crossroads when a road does not have traffic lights This sign instruct the drivers to stop when they reach the crossroad They can only proceed when the road ahead is empty Otherwise they must wait for the other vehicles to pass When the other vehicle have passed the driver can proceed This sign is one of the most significant and known signs of road traffic

The stop sign is not common in every country In some countries the stop sign is also written in the local language for example in Quebec Japan etc Some decades ago a different symbol was used to indicate the stop sign 

Salwar kameez is a traditional dress worn by both women and men in Southern Asia Salvars or shalvars are loose pajama like trousers The legs are wide at the top and narrow at the bottom The kameez is a long shirt or tunic The side seams are left open below the waist line which gives the wearer greater freedom of movement It is the most common dress for men in Pakistan and Afghanistan

Allspice is a spice which is the dried unripe fruit of the Pimenta dioica plant a tree native to the West Indies southern Mexico and Central America The tree Pimenta diocia is from the myrtle family and it is very valued for its berries The allspice was named because the flavor of the berry is like a mixture of cloves cinnamon and nutmeg It is used very much in baking mostly for making mincemeat and mixed pickling spice It was discovered first by the early Spanish explorers who mistook it for a type of pepper

Allspice is the only spice grown in the Western Hemisphere But after that the wild trees were cut down to get the berries and only a few allspice are left There are many plantations in Mexico and Central America too However the best allspice comes from Jamaica where the weather and soil are best for the berries

Allspice was used by the Mayans and by other South American Indians when making chocolate The name Jamaica comes from Xamayca This means land of wood and water in the language of the Arawaks The Arawaks used allspice to help keep the meat from rotting or sometimes against their enemies

The spice was imported to Europe after it was discovered There were many tries to plant it in the East but it did not work because the trees could not give a lot of fruit Even though it had a rich smell and a tasty flavor allspice never had the same cach in Europe as cinnamon or pepper The English started taking the spice by ship to England in 1737 but by that time the want for spices had been taken over by other kinds of products such as sugar and coffee It was still a little popular in England though where it came to be known as the English Spice In the Napoleonic war of 1812 Russian soldiers put the spice in their boots to keep their feet warm Because of this today the pimento oil from the allspice is usually used for the mens dress

Dried allspice berries look like large brown peppercorns and their colors are cocoa brown When the berries are not yet ripe they are harvested and dried by the sun They are different in size from between 4 to 7 mm in diameter and are dark brown Their skin is very wrinkled and the outer case has two seeds Allspice can be eaten ground or whole

Whole dried allspice can keep without a time limit if they are properly kept in airtight jars They also must not face the light It can be ground in a mill or an electric coffee grinder After it is ground the spice loses its flavor in a few days

The peony or paeony is the only genus in the flowering plant family Paeoniaceae They are native to Asia southern Europe and western North America

The Komodo dragon is a species of lizard that lives in the Indonesian islands of Komodo Rincah Flores Gili Motang and Gili Dasami It is the largest living kind of lizard They grow to an average length of 23 meters and weigh around 70kg Komodo dragon bites can be very dangerous and they sometimes attack people 

Western scientists first saw Komodo dragons in 1910 They are very popular animals in zoos because they are very big and look scary The lizards are in some danger There are very few Komodo dragons still alive on their home islands Indonesian law does not allow hunting these lizards Komodo National Park was made to help protect Komodo dragons

The Komodo dragon has other names It can also be called the Komodo Monitor or the Komodo Island Monitor by some scientists but this is not very common The people who live in Komodo Island call them ora buaja durat or biawak raksasa

The Komodo dragon is cold blooded It has a tail as long as its body It has about 60 sharp teeth that can grow up to 25 centimeters long It also has a long yellow forked tongue Its saliva is red because its gums almost completely cover its teeth When they eat their teeth cut their gums and make them bleed This creates a good environment for the dangerous bacteria that live in its mouth 

These lizards are the top predators in the areas where they live because they are so big

People used to think they were very big because there are no other large meat eating animals on the islands where they live Therefore they did not have to compete with other similar animals for the same food and places to live People also thought they were big because of their low metabolic rate 

However facts are different The fossil record shows that the Komodo is the last of a group of lizards called varanids These lizards have been about the same size for nearly a million years They had their origin in Australia nearly four million years ago and spread later to much of Indonesia Their size has nothing to do with being on a relatively small island

Most of them died out after contact with modern humans

The Komodo dragons earholes are easy to see but Komodo dragons are not very good at hearing It is able to see as far away as 300 meters but it is thought to have poor night vision The Komodo dragon is able to see in color but has trouble seeing objects that do not move 

The Komodo dragon uses its tongue to taste and smell like many other reptiles They have a special part of the body called the Jacobsons organ for smelling With the help of a good wind they can smell dead animals from 495 kilometres away The Komodo dragons nostrils are not very useful for smelling because it does not have a diaphragm It only has a few taste buds in the back of its throat Its scales have special connections to nerves that give the lizard a sense of touch The scales around its ears lips chin and bottoms of the feet may have three or more of these connections

Komodo dragons have dangerous bacteria in their saliva Scientists have identified 57 of them One of the most dangerous bacteria in Komodo dragon saliva appears to be a kind of Pasteurella multocida These bacteria cause disease in the blood of their victim If a bite does not kill an animal and it escapes it will usually die within a week from infection The Komodo dragon seems to never get sick from its own bacteria So researchers have been looking for the lizards antibacterial This may be used as medicine for humans

Mating begins between May and August and the eggs are laid in September Dragons leave about twenty eggs in empty nests left by birds called megapodes The eggs develop for seven to eight months The eggs open and the baby lizards come out in April when there are many insects to eat Young Komodo dragons live in trees where they are safe from adult Komodo dragons and other animals that might eat them They take around three to five years to mature and may live as long as fifty years Female Komodo dragons can have babies without fertilisation

The Komodo dragon likes hot and dry places and lives in dry open grassland savanna and tropical forest on lower land It is most active in the day because it is cold blooded although it is sometimes active at night Komodo dragons live alone They come together only to breed and eat They can run up to 20 kilometers per hour dive up to 45 metres at top speed for short periods of time When they are young they climb trees with their strong claws As the Komodo dragon grows bigger its claws are used mostly as weapons because it is too big to climb trees well 

The Komodo dragon digs holes for protection with its powerful legs and claws These holes can be from 13 metres wide Because it is very big and sleeps in holes it is able to keep itself warm through the night The Komodo dragon usually hunts in the afternoon but stays in the shade during the hottest part of the day Komodo dragons have special resting places on ridges that catch cool sea breezes

Komodo dragons are carnivores which means that they eat meat Although they eat mostly dead animals they will also catch live animals as prey When prey goes by a Komodo dragon it will suddenly charge at the animal and bite or claw the belly or the throat To catch animals that are up high and out of reach the Komodo dragon may stand on its back legs and use its tail as a support

Komodo dragons do not chew their food They eat by biting and pulling off large chunks of flesh and swallowing them whole They can swallow smaller prey up to the size of a goat whole This is because they have flexible jaws and skulls and their stomachs can expand Komodo dragons make much saliva to help the food move easily but swallowing still takes a long time Komodo dragons may try to swallow faster by running and pushing the dead animal in its mouth very hard against a tree Sometimes a lizard hits the tree so hard that it gets knocked out Dragons breath using a small tube under the tongue that connects to the lungs This allows it to continue breathing even while swallowing large things Komodo dragons can eat up to 80 percent of its body weight in one meal After swallowing its food it drags itself to a sunny place to speed up digestion so the food does not rot and poison the dragon Large dragons can survive on as little as 12 meals a year After digestion the Komodo dragon vomits the horns hair and teeth of the animal it ate This vomit is covered in a smelly mucus After vomiting it rubs its face in the dirt or on bushes to get rid of the mucus This suggests that komodo dragons dislike the smell just like humans do

The largest animals usually eat first while the smaller ones eat later Dragons of equal size may wrestle each other Losers usually run away although sometimes they are chased and eaten by the winners

The Komodo dragons diet includes invertebrates other reptiles birds bird eggs small mammals monkeys wild boars goats deer horses and water buffalo Young Komodo dragons will eat insects eggs geckoes and small mammals Komodo dragons may eat people and they can even dig up bodies from their graves to eat them Therefore people on Komodo Island moved their graves from sandy to clay ground and piled rocks on top to stop the lizards from digging up dead bodies

Because the Komodo dragon does not have a diaphragm it cannot suck water when drinking It cannot lap water with its tongue either Instead it drinks by taking a mouthful of water lifting its head and letting the water run down its throat

Recent fossils from Queensland suggests that the Komodo dragon evolved in Australia before spreading to Indonesia Its body size remained stable on Flores ever since the islands were isolated by rising sea levels about 900000 years ago The sea level dropped very low during the last ice age and uncovered wide areas of continental shelf The Komodo dragon spread into these areas They became isolated on the islands where they live today when sea levels rose again They moved into what is now the Indonesian island group They spread as far east as the island of Timor 

Komodo dragons have been popular in zoos for a long time However there are few of them in zoos because they may become sick and do not have babies easily As of May 2009 there are 13 European 2 African 35 North American 1 Singaporean and 2 Australian institutions that keep Komodo dragons

A Komodo dragon was shown in a zoo for the first time in 1934 at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park But it lived for only two years People continued to try to keep Komodo dragons in zoos but the lives of these creatures was very short The average life of a dragon in a zoo was five years in the National Zoological Park Walter Auffenberg studied the dragons in zoos and eventually helped zoos to keep dragons more successfully

Many dragons in zoos may become tamer than wild lizards within a short period of time in a zoo Many zoo keepers have brought the animals out of their cages to meet visitors without any problems Dragons can also recognize individual humans However even dragons that seem tame may surprise people and become aggressive This can often happen when a stranger enters the animals home 

Research with captive Komodo dragons has shown that they play One dragon would push a shovel left and seemed attracted to the sound of it moving across rocks A young female dragon at the National Zoo in Washington DC would grab and shake things like statues drink cans plastic rings and blankets She would also put her head in boxes shoes and other objects She did not make a mistake and think these objects were food she would only swallow them if they were covered in rat blood

Komodo dragons do not attack human very often However they do sometimes hurt or kill people

In June 2001 a Komodo dragon seriously hurt Phil Bronsteinexecutive editor of the San Francisco Chronicle Bronstein had entered the dragons cage at the Los Angeles Zoo after being invited in by its keeper The zoo keeper had told him to take off his white shoes which could have excited the Komodo dragon Bronstein was bitten on his bare foot Although he escaped he needed surgery to repair his foot

On June 4 2007 a Komodo dragon attacked an eight year old boy on Komodo Island The boy later died because he lost too much blood This was the first time that people know a dragon had killed a human in 33 years Local people blamed the attack on environmentalists People from outside the island had stopped local people from killing goats and leaving them for the dragons The Komodo dragons no longer found the food they needed so they came into places where humans lived in search of food Many natives of Komodo Island believe that Komodo dragons are actually the reincarnation of relatives and should be treated with respect

On March 24 2009 two Komodo dragons attacked and killed fisherman Muhamad Anwar on Komodo Island They attacked Anwar after he fell out of a sugar apple tree He was bleeding badly from bites on his hands body legs and neck He was taken to a clinic on the nearby island of Flores but doctors said he was dead when he arrived

There are very few Komodo dragons and they may not survive The lizards are on the IUCN Red List of animals in danger Not many Komodo dragons still live on their home islands

However there may now be only 350 females having babies in the wild The Komodo National Park was founded in 1980 to protect the Komodo dragon on its home islands 

Many things have reduced the number of dragons including volcanoes earthquakes loss of good places to live fire not enough animals to eat tourism and illegal hunting

Buying or selling Komodo dragons or their skins is illegal as part of an international law called CITES

Organized crime is a group or groups of people usually mobsters and other criminals who work to make money in an illegal way

Usually students must have an undergraduate degree before beginning graduate school Many universities give graduate degrees A graduate school is not always a separate school

The term graduate school could be confusing because the verb graduate is also used to mean completing high school education or a bachelors degree The verb infinitive to graduate is used for all those types of schools but the meaning of the adjective graduate is changed to mean postgraduate in the term graduate school The small change in meaning can be viewed with an air of sophistication where experienced students are often more aware of the issue while novice students might not be aware as being more naive

Sexual dimorphism is a concept from biology It means that the male and the female of a species look noticeably different The word comes from two Greek di and morphe 

It is the most common type of polymorphism It gives rise to sexual selection that is competition between members of the same species for reproduction

The features that distinguish the two sexes of a species are called secondary sex characteristics They are not directly part of the reproductive system They are the product of sexual selection for traits which give an individual an advantage over its rivals in getting and keeping mates

The difference between sexes can include

The main functions of sexual dimorphism are to improve the individuals chance of mating in various ways

Some animals show these differences only during mating season Deer shed their antlers and peacocks shed their tails out of season This minimises the key disadvantage of sexual dimorphism That is it makes the male much easier to see by predators

Kavirondo is the old name of the region around Kavirondo Gulf as well as of two native peoples living there under the regime of British East Africa Broadly this was defined as those who dwelt in the valley of the Nzoia River on the western slopes of Mount Elgon and along the northeast coast of Victoria Nyanza 

Suggested origins of the name Kavirondo include 

Kavirondo is the general name of two distinct groups of tribes The Bantu immigrated from the south and the other Nilotic came from the north The Bantu appear to have been the first The Nilotic tribes are probably an offshoot of the Acholi They appear to have crossed the lake to reach their current home the country around Kavirondo Gulf Of the two groups the Bantu now occupy a more northerly position than their neighbors and are practically the most northerly representatives of that race Their further progress north was stopped by the southward movement of the Nilotic tribes while the Nilotic Kavirondo in their turn had their wanderings arrested by an irruption of Elgumi people from the east 

The Bantu Kavirondo are divided into three principal types the Awa Rimi the Awa Ware and the Awa Kisii Their Bantu neighbors call the Nilotic Kavirondo Ja Mwa The generic name for the Nilotic tribes is Ja Luo but the Bantu Kavirondo call them Awa Nyoro The two groups have many characteristics in common 

The Kavirondo have many tribes divided Sir H H Johnston suspects totemically

Traditionally these people seem to be naked The men of the Nilotic Kavirondo start to wear a small piece of goat skin on their penis when they become fathers This is called Sembe Even though this covering is practically useless as a covering ettiquette says it must still be worn Even those men who wear clothes must wear the goat skin when they are fathers 

Men of the tribe have traveled more and have had more contact with white people Some of the tribesmen now wear European style clothing Women traveled less or were more conservative They kept the nudity or the few garments they had before

Among the Bantu Kavirondo married women wear a short fringe of black string in front and a tassel of banana fiber suspended from a girdle behind This tassel looks like a tail from a distance The first travelers to Africa talked about a tailed race The Nilotic Kavirondo women wear the tail but not the fringe in front For dandy they wear a goat skin slung over the shoulders 

Some of the Bantu tribes practice circumcision the Nilotic tribes do not Patterns are tattooed on chest and stomach for ornament Men even husbands are forbidden to touch the womens tails which must be worn even should any other clothing be wrapped round the body 

The Kavirondo are known for being independent eager and ready to fight They are seen as honest and as having a high sexual morality traits common among the Bantu tribes There are more women than men For this reason polygamy is common

Among the Bantu tribes a man has the refusal of all the younger sisters of his wife as they attain puberty Practically no woman lives unmarried all her life for if no suitor seeks her she singles out a man and offers herself to him at a reduced price an offer usually accepted as the women are excellent agricultural laborers The Nilotic Kavirondo incline to exogamy endeavoring always to marry outside their clan Girls are betrothed at six or seven and the husband elect continually makes small presents to his father in law elect till the bride reaches womanhood It is regarded as shameful if the girl be not found a virgin on her wedding day She is sent back to her parents who have to return the marriage price and pay a fine The wifes adultery was formerly punished with death and the capital penalty was also inflicted on young men and girls guilty of adultery Among the Bantu Kavirondo the usual minimum price for a wife is forty hoes twenty goats and one cow paid in installments The Nilotic Kavirondo pay twenty sheep and two to six cows the husband elect can claim his bride after half payment if a woman dies without bearing children the amount of her purchase is returnable by her father unless the widower consents to replace her by another sister The women are prolific and the birth of twins is common and considered a lucky event which is celebrated by feasting and dances Among the Bantu Kavirondo the mother of twins must remain in her hut for seven days among the Nilotic Kavirondo the parents and the infants must stay in the hut for a whole month If a Bantu mother has lost two children in succession the next child born is taken out at dawn and placed on the road where it is left till a neighbor usually a woman friend who has gone that way on purpose picks it up and takes it to its mother who gives a goat in return a somewhat similar custom prevails among the Niotic tribes Names are not male and female and a daughter often bears her fathers name

The Kavirondo bury their dead Among one of the Bantu tribes the Awa Kisesa a chief is buried in the floor of his own hut in a sitting position but at such a depth that the head protrudes Over the head an earthenware pot is placed and his principal wives have to remain in the hut till the flesh is eaten by ants or decomposes when the skull is removed and buried close to the hut Later the skeleton is unearthed and reburied with much ceremony in the sacred burial place of the tribe Married women of the Bantu tribes are buried in their hut lying on their right side with legs doubled up the hut being then deserted Among the Nilotic tribes the grave is dug beneath the veranda of the hut Men of the Bantu tribes are buried in an open space in the midst of their huts in the Nilotic tribes if the first wife of the deceased be alive he is buried in her hut if not beneath the veranda of the hut in which he died A child is buried near the door of its mothers hut A sign of mourning is a cord of banana fiber worn round the neck and waist

A chief chooses sometimes years before his death one of his sons to succeed him often giving a brass bracelet as insignia A mans property is divided equally among his children

While some tribes live in isolated huts those in the north have strongly walled villages The walls are of mud and formerly among the Nilotic tribes occasionally of stone Since colonization by the British the security of the country induced the Kavirondo to let the walls fall into disrepair Their huts are circular with conical thatched roofs and fairly broad verandas all round

A portion of the hut is partitioned off as a sleeping place for goats and the fowls sleep indoors in a large basket Skins form the only bedsteads In each hut are two fireplaces about which a rigid etiquette prevails Strangers or distant relatives are not allowed to pass beyond the first which is near the door and is used for cooking At the second which is nearly in the middle of the hut sits the hut owner his wives children brothers and sisters Around this fireplace the family sleep

Cooking pots water pots and earthenware grain jars are the only other furniture The food is served in small baskets Every full grown man has a hut to himself and one for each wife The huts of the Masaba Kavirondo of west Elgon have the apex of the roof surmounted by a carved pole which Sir H H Johnston says is obviously a phallus Among the Bantu Kavirondo a father does not eat with his sons nor do brothers eat together Among the Nilotic tribes father and sons eat together usually in a separate hut with open sides Women eat apart and only after the men have finished 

Though a peaceful people the Kavirondo fight well Their weapons are spears with rather long flat blades without blood courses and broad bladed swords Some use slings and most carry shields Bows and arrows are also used firearms are however displacing other weapons Kavirondo warfare was mainly defensive and intertribal this last a form of vendetta When a man had killed his enemy in battle he shaved his head on his return and was rubbed with medicine to defend him from the spirit of the dead man The Awa Wanga abandoned this custom when they obtained firearms The young warriors were made to stab the bodies of their slain enemies 

In the colonial era the Kavirondo are on the increase due to their fecundity and morality Those who live in the low lying lands suffer from a mild malaria while abroad they are subject to dysentery and pneumonia Epidemics of small pox have occurred Native medicine is of the simplest They dress wounds with butter and leaves and for inflammation of the lungs or pleurisy pierce a hole in the chest There are no medicine men the women are the doctors Certain of the incisor teeth are pulled out If a man retains these he will it is thought be killed in warfare Among certain tribes the women also have incisor teeth extracted otherwise misfortune would befall their husbands For the same reason the wife scars the skin of her forehead or stomach A Kavirondo husband before starting on a perilous journey cuts scars on his wifes body to ensure him good luck

Of dances the Kavirondo have the birth dance the death dance that at initiation and one of a propitiatory kind in seasons of drought Their music is plaintive and sometimes pretty produced by a large lyre shaped instrument They also use various drums

The Ja Luo women use small beads attached to pieces of brass for ear ornaments Like the aggry beads of West Africa these beads are not of local manufacture nor of recent introduction They are ancient generally blue in color occasionally yellow or green and are picked up in certain districts after heavy rain The natives believe they come down with the rain They are identical in shape and color to ancient Egyptian beads and other beads obtained from ancient cities in Baluchistan

Religion and beliefs They appears to practice a vague ancestor worship but the northern tribes have two gods Awafwa and Ishishemi the spirits of good and evil To the former cattle and goats are sacrificed 

The Kavirondo have great faith in divination from the entrails of a sheep Nearly everybody and everything are ominous of good or evil to the Kavirondo 

They have few myths or traditions the antbear is the chief figure in their beast legends 

They believe in witchcraft and practice trial by ordeal

The Kavirondo are essentially an agricultural people both men and women work in the fields with large iron hoes In addition to sorghum Eleusine and maize tobacco and hemp are both cultivated and smoked Both sexes smoke but the use of hemp is restricted to men and unmarried women as it is thought to injure child bearing women Hemp is smoked in a hubble bubble The Kavirondo cultivate sesamum and make an oil from its seeds which they burn in little clay lamps of the ancient saucer type the pattern being in Hobleys opinion introduced into the country by the coast people 

The Kavirondo keep cattle sheep goats fowls and a few dogs Women do not eat sheep fowls or eggs and are not allowed to drink milk except when mixed with other things The flesh of the wild cat and leopard is esteemed by most of the tribes Among the Bantu Kavirondo goats and sheep are suffocated the snout being held until the animal dies From Eleusine a beer is made 

The Kavirondo are plucky hunters capturing the hippopotamus with ropes and traps and attacking with spears the largest elephants Fish of which they are very fond are caught by line and rod or in traps Bee keeping is common and where trees are scarce the hives are placed on the roof of the hut 

Traditional Kavirondo industries are salt making effected by burning reeds and water plants and passing water through the ashes the smelting of iron ore pottery and basket work

The Last Judgment is a mural by Michelangelo on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City It took nine years to complete Michelangelo began working on it thirty years after finishing the ceiling of the chapel

The work spans the entire wall behind the altar of the Sistine Chapel It was painted between 1534 and 1541 The Last Judgment shows the second coming of Christ and the apocalypse The souls of humans rise and descend to their fates as judged by Christ surrounded by his saints

There was a dispute regarding The Last Judgment between Cardinal Carafa and Michelangelo Michelangelo was accused of immorality and obscenity because he had painted naked figures with their genitals well visible The cardinal said that this could not be tolerated inside the most important church of Christianity A censorship campaign was lauched known as the Fig leaf campaign Carafa and Monsignor Sernini launched the campaign to remove the frescoes When the Popes own Master of Ceremonies Biagio da Cesena said it was mostly disgraceful that in so sacred a place there should have been depicted all those nude figures exposing themselves so shamefully and that it was no work for a papal chapel but rather for the public baths and taverns Michelangelo worked the Cesenas semblance into the scene as Minos judge of the underworld It is said that when Cesena complained to the Pope the pontiff responded that his jurisdiction did not extend to hell so the portrait would have to remain

The genitalia in the fresco were later covered by the artist Daniele da Volterra whom history remembers by the derogatory nickname Il Braghettone

In the painting Michelangelo does a self portrait depicting himself as St Bartholomew after he had been flayed This is reflective of the feelings of contempt Michelangelo had for being commissioned to paint The Last Judgement

The fancy rat or pet rat is a type of the brown rat that is bred to be a pet The name fancy rat has nothing to do with the fanciness of how they look It comes from the phrase animal fancy A person who keeps pet rats is said to be involved in rat fancy Some people domesticate black rats and Gambian pouched rats These types of rats are not usually called fancy rats because the hobby does not center around them

Fancy rats have been bred as pets at least since the late 19th century They can have many different colors and coat types They are sociable intelligent animals They can learn to come when called use a litter box and do many different tricks Pet rats act differently from rats found in nature The number of generations since they have been removed from the wild and how they were bred has an effect on how much they act differently They are not any more of a health risk than other common pets

The 1857 War of Independence in Murree part of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a conflict between the tribes surrounding the hill station of Murree and the colonial government of British India The local tribes had become angry with the British ever since the British had started their colonial rule in the area

Today Murree is part of Pakistan but in 1857 it was part of British India ever since the British rule began in India there had been rebellions and wars against the British However in 1857 rebellions broke out in many different places Murree being one of these places People thought the rule of the British was about to be overthrown In the Murree hills it was the Dhund Abbasi and Tanoli tribes who rose up against the British

Although the tribes of Murree had risen against the British not everyone had been against British rule Before British rule had been established in the area the tribes had fought against the Sikhs Under the command of Mohammed Ali Shah they had fought against the Sikh Army in Balakot  the troops here were commanded by Seyed Shah Ismail Shahid and Syed Ahmad Shaheed

The Pir of Dewal had also died fighting in Dewal against the Sikh army chief Hari Singh Nalwa Nalwa then built a fort on between Punjab and North West Frontier Province in 1815 now called Aarhi or Hadd Nalwas troops had brutally crushed the tribes of Circle Bakote and beheaded many of them He also sold the ladies of these tribes in Jammu central bazaar in 1834 

The British after battling in Rawalpindi in 1845 had captured Jind Kaur the widow of Ranjit Singh  this caused the collapse of Sikh rule and when the British marched into the Murree area the local tribes at first welcomed them However many of the tribes soon considered that they had exchanged one form of occupation for another and events elsewhere in India also encouraged an uprising 

The British had recruited many of the tribes in the area into their army for example many members of the Satti Tribe were recruited as Sepoys and the British commanders won this war largely by the use of Indian soldiers

The masterminds of this plan of independence were two Seyed brothers from Dhoke Syedan of Dewal Sharif The War against the British had reached Murree and the Southern Areas of Hazara part of which is now known as Circle Bakote in July 1857 when the Dhond Abbasi leader Sardar Sherbaz Khan planned to attack the British

Sardar Khan had the support of the following important tribal leaders

By the end of August many of the British troops who had been in Murree had left to join the attack on Delhi Rebels had taken Delhi from British control and the British had sent as many soldiers as they could The decision to send troops to Delhi meant that the defence of Murree was weakened However the British were unable to take Delhi quickly and as Delhi still held out against the British the Dhund tribesmen decided to take Murree The Dhund attacked Murree by rising on every side at the same time and crowding up the nearer hill sides threatening destruction of the station Several of the table servants supported the hill men and for some hours the danger to Murree became imminent

According to the 1857 Punjab Mutiny Report the attack failed because the British were told of the plan to attack them One of Lady Lawrences servants named Hakim Khan told the British of the attack to come The loyalty of Hakim was described in the report as the means under God of saving Murree The British quickly organised defences and quickly got volunteers A cordon of sentries surrounded the station and the three weakest points were held in some force When the Dhunds arrived in the middle of the night they found the whole station waiting for them

After a few hours of skirmishing the Dhonds retreated with the loss of two or three of their men who had come within musket range of the British The British however were to learn that the rebellion was wider than just the Dhonds After the Dhoonds had been forced back it was found that many more clans and tribes had been part of the plan It had reached far into Hazara and nearly down to Rawalpindi and apart from the Khurrul rebellion in Multan was largest rebellion that had occurred in the Punjab during that year

The British also convicted and executed two Hindustani doctors for being involved in the plot They had been educated in government institutions were practising in Murree and employed by the government The British suspected that the Dhonds were expecting support from their Hindustani allies so as well as the doctors several domestic servants were seized and punished 

An urgent request was sent to troops in Hazara to reinforce Murree and Major Beecher sent every available man from Abbottabad to Murree  however the British troops in Murree had managed to secure the station and beat off the attack before the arrival of reinforcements 

According the Punjab Mutiny report however the reinforcement themselves were almost ambushed The march from Abbottabad to Murree was difficult The Khurrals laid an ambush to cut them off but they were saved by luck The Khurral had set traps and were waiting to ambush the British on a road however the rains made the road hard to cross The British took another road to Murree and were later to learn of the trap

The revolt did not succeed he rebels were betrayed and as punishment all of Sardar Sherbaz Khans eight sons were blasted by cannon fire in Murree whilst Sardar Khan himself was hanged

Greetings Simple Wikipedians I used to have an account but perhaps its been deactivated due to inactivity My name is Hunter Im teaching a computer course in Chalermkwansatree School in Phitsanulok Thailand and have given my students an assignment to create content that did not previously exist in Simple English Wikipedia I have split the class into 15 article writing groups 4 English editors and 2 factual content editors I wanted everybody to have an account like Chalermkwan1 Chalermkwan2 etc CHSeditor1 etc We were only allowed to create 6 accounts from the same IP range For this reason I told any groups that were unable to create an account to just use the Chalermkwan13 account 

In the meantime many of the groups have posted their articles and today our editing team was going to begin the proofreading process I thought it would be most efficient to let them do the editing on wikipedia itself so they can experience first hand the collaborative working experience I didnt think any pages would be edited or deleted by moderators in such a short amount of time so I didnt bother instructing them about what to do if someone deletes their article Some of them panicked and reversed moderators changes because they were afraid they would not get points for the assignment I have instructed my students to refrain from logging in and changing anything until I am able to resolve this issue with the Simple English moderators

Aem Fatson I understand your initial suspicions of vandalism and reasons for blocking my students accounts and deleting their articles But please be patient We want to enrich Simple English Wikipedia We have a process in place for correction If you unblock my students and wait a week or two I will notify you that our editing teams have finished their work I am a native speaker and will also play a final supervisory role in the editing process should that be a concern

FYI here is a list of the groups and topics that they are working on

Hello

I have recently seen stubs of the form XXX is a song by YYY ZZZZ covered it on their new album AAA While Wikipedia is not paper I wonder whether we could get any guidelines or criteria for including such items 

These are of course just my thoughts We also have notability guiidleinescriteria for other items why not also for songs and artitsbands  Eptalon 1044 11 November 2008

Hello I was just thinking about how to attract new editors

In your opinion how easy would it be to attract people to writesimplify artists about these kinds of subjects  In theory there are many more people interested in say the arts than there are in say Pokemon monsters 

My idea would be to get a team of say 5 10 people together that were able to provide articles on such subjects

What do you think Eptalon 1603 11 November 2008

Hello I just finished spellchecker installers for Mozilla and OpenOffice 30 with about 5000 words They mix the wordlists of SIMPLEdic and Rick Harrisons Universal Language Dictionary and fixed a bug in the file simpleaff Ricks wordlist includes several common words for food plants and animals and even body parts missing in the other dictionaries I want to post the installers on the websites of those programs and then add links in these pages but Id like to have an opinion from other users Lwyx 1740 11 November 2008

Hello all there is a tool that can calculate some measure of readabilty I did some tests on current VGAs and I found values between 610 and 700 for Flesch Reading Ease Before we go and believe in numbers

Thanks for understanding Eptalon 2230 13 November 2008 Hello there A readability score is a number calculated based on a formula and the following assumptions

Depending on which of the indices you take there are also some constants which enter these formulae Note however

Instead of relying on old methodolgy we should get a more recent testing methodology that ideally also does either lexical or semantic analysis The next step is then to go over the 40000 articles from those that apply calculatuate mean median and mode of the score Ideally we thern base our age group on the median of what we get there Once we have determined a mathematical distribution we can then numerically score each article based on where it sits in that distribution This is much better than simply noting complex We than know that an article of complexity 48 needs less work than one of complexity 5 Articles that I have found thast might be useful 

Some ideas

Problem the last one is semantic nonsense the second last has a different meaning If all you do is count words and syllables and mingle them up in a formula you will not be able to recognise such things If you do a frequency analysis you will see that words like a and the add little information

Comments are of course welcome  Eptalon 0958 14 November 2008Is there a problem with the current VGAs over that particular limit Would they now fail I cant see why they would Granted readability should be taken into account but to rigorously adhere to Flesch Kincaid isnt desirable Instead of simply tagging it might be best to assess on a case by case basis its the human eye that is needed not this sort of method Judge complexity for yourself and not for what a method says it is That should also be taken into account PeterSymonds 2203 15 November 2008

There are currently 23 VGAs I did a little statistics on them Flesch Reading Ease ranges from 444 to 702 Flesch Kincaid 129 69

Top three

If we take Flesch Kincaid we get Charles Spurgeon together with the Chili Peppers on second place Pope John Paul II is number 3

The bottom of the list

Same game FC

The article taken for the Median is Violin for the mean you have Violin slightly below and American Airlines Flight 11 sligtly above For FC you have Violin and Oklahoma sligntly below the meanat the median and Powderfinger slightly above

Should I do the same thing for good articles  Eptalon 1449 14 November 2008

I couldnt resist and this the same as above for good articles There are currently 19

Flesch Reading Ease 781 53 Flesch Kincaid 121 6

Top 3

For FK MouthPiece replaced by Giant Panda on 3rd place

Bottom 3

For FK Mouthpiece replaces Lenzburg

Jupiter is average for FRE for the median Jupiter slighlty below Kitzmiller v Dover Area School District above the median For FK Kurt Warner and Caffeine are both at the median For the mode Kitzmiller and Jupiter Muhammad is the first above the mean Kurt and Caffeine are the first below 

And of course full stats available on req  Eptalon 1622 14 November 2008

What can I say I made some mistakes and it cost me cratship Isnt that what voting is for anyway 

I wont resort to StaticFalconisms and retire over a defeat and I would like to say that I will still obviously be editing as frequently as before here I dont think any differently towards those who voted oppose or support To quote Rudyard Kipling If you can meet with triumph and disaster And treat those two imposters just the same Youll be a man my son

To clear up issues the deletion of Manchester was a complete mistake on my part I saw a long article read a few sentences and thought it had been copy pasted from ENWP As for the RfD I counted votes calculated there was about 55  60 support for deletion which was too close to a 5050 vote for my liking so I closed as keep

I hope you can all mirror Kipling as I like to think I can and dont think any differently of me either Thanks to all who voted on my RfB  Gwib  1025 15 November 2008

Hi all

Quick question about images I understand that uploads are not allowed and to use commons instead BUT  what if the image is not suitable for commons ie a copyrighted logo

The two I want are enImageBBC Children in Needpng and enImageCiNbbcpng I would assume with appropriate FURs it would be ok

Thanks

BG7even 1750 15 November 2008

Some kinds of logos do not have any creative output and can be uploaded but these exceptions are very rare such as the logo for AIG alexandra 1814 15 November 2008 We are currently 30 regular editors here all of them work pretty much as much all they can Where do you think we get the resources for checking images  Therefore no image uploads if you think certain logos should be ok take that up with commons as we do not have the resources  Eptalon 1325 16 November 2008

Ok I think the wiki is now active enough to allow uploads so im adding this

Option one is to add an Image Uploader right which will be granted to certain users and allows local image uploads of Fair Use images The right would be given to users after a short process still tbc to check that they will not abuse it There would be a requests page that could be used by users without the right to ask for uploads Comments please BG7even 0358 17 November 2008

   Fair Use uploads are allowed by all autoconfirmed users but are checked by a committee to see if they are sutiable Unsuitable images are tagged for deletion BG7even 0358 17 November 2008

Since options 1 and 4 are close I think we need a bigger vote at the end to really know which one has more support not everyone voted for all the options Techman224Talk 1420 17 November 2008

   Ok lets combine the options into one vote instead of separating them now that theres only two options Anyone in favor of option 1 and allowing fair use images under a image uploader group vote for support Anyone who wants option 4 and keeping everything the same as it is now vote for oppose Techman224Talk 1722 17 November 2008

Sorry guys but this voting is so totally messed up that it makes it completely impossible to determine any kind of consensus from this To start off with we should have said Sign under the proposal you agree with and then passed the one with the most Because of the way weve done it some people are going to just vote support for the ones they like and others are going to support the one they like and oppose the rest making the results useless And weve carried it on with the option 1 or 4 thing because now were asking absolutely everyone that voted before to come back and vote again otherwise their votes meant absolutely nothing I think this needs to be restarted there is no way everyone will do the same thing when its this complicated The results wont actually mean anything Archer7  talk 1945 17 November 2008

Hello all while the proposal to allow some kind of image uploads here this is not our focus and it should not be We want to make a free encyclopedia anyone can change This means we should be concerned with making new articles or making those that exist better We are a very small community to the point that you have probably seen all the regulars when you have been here a week When we start talking about images we necessarily need to talk about licenses the stuff you are allowed to do with images Can you tell me what the difference is between a GPL liencensed image and one under one of the Creative Commons licenses  Personally I am not too interested to know I want to be able to USE image to illustrate an article if possible I want to be able to focus on what is needed to make an article better rather than battling with image licenses But there are those people who are fascinated by image licenses by ensuring the images are used according to what their license specifies Those guys sit around at Wikimedia Commons I will therefore leave these decisions to them and if you think that a given product logo should be in your article it is in my opinion better to talk to the guys and gals at Commons they have the resources we dont So what was the thing we were supposed to vote on  Eptalon 2033 17 November 2008

Jaguar S Type was a car produced by Jaguar from 1998 till 2008 It was first shown at the 1998 Birmingham Motor Show and shared retro styling with the Rover 75 which was shown at that same show

The S Type was replaced by the Jaguar XF in the spring of 2008

Muskrats are rodents that live in freshwater and saltwater marshes lakes ponds and streams Muskrats often build dome shaped houses in marshes These houses made of plants protect the muskrat from predators since the only entrance is underwater Some muskrats live in burrows on the water banks Muskrats are excellent swimmers but are slow on land 

Muskrats are native to North America but have been brought to Europe and Asia where they now live in the wild Muskrats got their name because they have musk glands that produce a strong scent 

Griffiths experiment was an experiment done in 1928 by Frederick Griffith It was one of the first experiments showing that bacteria can get DNA through a process called transformation

Griffith used two strains of Pneumococcus These bacteria infect mice He used a type III S and type II R strain The III S strain covers itself with a polysaccharide capsule that protects it from the hosts immune system This means that the host will die The II R strain does not have that protective shield around it and is killed by the hosts immune system

In this experiment bacteria from the III S strain were killed by heat and their remains were added to II R strain bacteria While neither harmed the mice on their own the blend of the two was able to kill mice 

Griffith was also able to get both live II R and live III S strains of pneumococcus from the blood of these dead mice He concluded that the type II R had been transformed into the lethal III S strain by a transforming principle that was somehow part of the dead III S strain bacteria

Today we know that the transforming principle Griffith saw was the DNA of the III S strain bacteria While the bacteria had been killed the DNA had survived the heating process and was taken up by the II R strain bacteria The III S strain DNA contains the genes that form the shielding polysaccharide part from attack Armed with this gene the former II R strain bacteria were now protected from the hosts immune system and could kill the host 

The exact nature of the transforming principle was confirmed in the experiments done by Avery McLeod and McCarty and by Hershey and Chase

Frederick Griffith was a British medical officer and geneticist In 1928 during an experiment he discovered what he called a transforming principle but today we call DNA 

He was born in Hale England and attended Liverpool University where he studied genetics In his younger days he worked for the Liverpool Royal Infirmary the Thompson Yates Laboratory and the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis 

The experiment began when Griffith was trying to make a vaccine to prevent pneumonia infections in the Spanish flu influenza pandemic after World War I by using two strains of the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterium

Griffith was killed at work in his laboratory in 1941 along with longtime friend and bacteriologist William M Scott in London during an air raid in the London Blitz Years later Griffiths transforming principle was identified as DNA by Oswald Theodore Avery along with coworkers Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty in 1944 the AveryMacLeodMcCarty experiment

Streptococcus pneumoniae or pneumococcus is a Gram positive alpha hemolytic diplococcus aerotolerant anaerobe and a member of the genus Streptococcus An important human pathogen S pneumoniae was recognized as a major cause of pneumonia in the late 19th century and is the subject of many humoral immunity studies

In biology strain is a low level taxonomic rank used in three related ways

A strain is a genetic variant or subtype of a microorganism that is to say a virus or bacterium or fungus For example a flu strain is a certain biological form of the influenza or flu virus Properly speaking Bacteria Archaea and viruses do not have species because they do not have eukaryote type sexual reproduction Bacteria do exchange DNA but they may exchange it between different kinds of bacteria illustrating their considerable difference from eukaryotes Strains are therefore an absolutely essential part of bacterial identification 

In botany the term is not used to rank plants It is sometimes used to refer to all the descendants produced from a common ancestor that share a uniform morphological or physiological character A strain is a designated group of offspring that have descended from a modified plant produced ether by conventional breeding or by biotechnological means or result from genetic mutation As an example some rice strains are made by inserting new genetic material into a rice plant all the descendants of the genetically modified rice plant are a strain with a unique genetic code that is passed on to later generations the strain designation which is normally a number or a formal name covers all the plants that descent from the originally modified plant The rice plants in the strain can be breed to other rice strains or cultivars and if desirable plants are produced these are further breed to stabilize the desirable traits the stabilized plants that can be propagated and come true are given a cultivar name and released into production to be used by farmers

A mouse or a rat strain is a group of animals that is genetically uniform Strains are used in laboratory experiments Mouse strains can be inbred or genetically engineered while rat strains are usually produced by inbreeding

Thomas Wentworth Tom Wills was an Australian all round sportsman who helped invent Australian Football and umpired the first ever game of Australian Football and helped write the Laws of Australian Football

Wills was born in south east New South Wales Australia either near Gundagai or Queanbeyan 

From the age of 14 he went to Rugby School in England At school he played both rugby football and cricket very well By his final year in England he was captain of the Rugby XI and he was listed in Bells Sporting Life as being one of the most promising young cricketers in England

In 1858 Wills created a set of football rules that were like a cross between rugby soccer and Gaelic football He made up the game for cricketers to keep in shape during the off season Wills had help in making up the game from other people including his cousin Henry Colden Harrison and WJ Hammersly and JB Thompson This game is now Australian Rules Football 

Wills grew up with Indigenous Australians He spoke the language of the people who lived near him and played with the children It has been suggested that Australian Rules Football is based in part on Marn Grook an Aboriginal game with some similar rules to Australian Rules Football Because the indigenous people Wills paid with as a child would have played Marn Grook Wills would have been influenced by this game when creating the rules for Australian Rules Football

In 1868 Wills coached the first Australian cricket team to tour England which was composed entirely of Indigenous Australians

Simple Plan is the third self titled studio album by pop punk band Simple Plan

N Type Semiconductor is created by adding pentavalent impurities like Phosphorus Arsenic or Antimony The purpose of doing so is to make more charge carriers or electrons available in the material for conduction 

Semiconductor materials like Silicon and Germanium have four electrons in their outer shell All the four electrons are used by the semiconductor atom in forming bonds with its neighboring atoms leaving a low number of electrons available for conduction Pentavalent elements are those elements which have five electrons in their outer shell When pentavalent impurities like Phosphorus or Arsenic are added into semiconductor four electrons form bonds with the surrounding silicon atoms leaving one electron free The resulting material has a large number of free electrons Since electrons are negative charge carriers the resultant material is called N type semiconductor The pentavalent impurity that is added is called Dopant and the process of addition is called doping

N Type semiconductor is manufactured by doping intrinsic or pure semiconductor material The amount of impurity added is very small compared to the amount of semiconductor Characteristics and nature of the resultant semiconductor can be controlled by controlling the quantity of dopant

A plug in hybrid car is similar to a conventional hybrid vehicleboth use a gasoline engine as well as an electric motor A plug in hybrid differs primarily in that it can be plugged in to charge the batteries while a conventional hybrid relies solely on energy generated from braking coasting or from the gasoline engine

However a plug in hybrid uses larger battery packs that can be recharged by connecting to common household electricity Plug in hybrids can be driven for long distancesfrom a few miles to as much as 40 mileswithout using any gasoline Plug in hybrid cars are also known as plug in hybrid electric vehicles or PHEVs Plug in hybrid cars that use a gas engine exclusively for recharging batteriesrather than directly powering the wheelsare also called Extended Range Electric Vehicles or E REVs

Fueling your car with electricity is about 5 times cheaper than fueling it with gasoline That is like buying gasoline at less than 1 per gallon It also reduces your greenhouse pollution and helps reduce crude oil imports Also plug in hybrids produced substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions than either conventional gasoline cars or unplugged hybrids The reduction in emissions results from electric operation being much more efficient than gasoline operation 

Criticisms of the hybrid include the additional cost weight and size of a larger battery pack But The extra weight of the batteries will be offset somewhat by the reduced weight of the gas engine 

It is obvious for most people that internal combustion engine cars cannot represent the future anymore because of the oil reserves that are estimated to be finished in forty or fifty years Obviously Plug in vehicles cannot be considered a short term option because we lack the needed infrastructure and capable batteries for increasing the autonomy that is currently limited The general opinion was that at least for the next seven or eight years Plug ins are not going to become the standard in hybrid vehicles and that regular HEVs will have the biggest proportion on the market

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers an international non profit professional organization for the advancement of technology related to electricity It has the most members of any technical professional organization in the world with more than 400000 members in more than 160 countries About 45 of of IEEEs members live outside the United States

It was formed in 1963 by the merger of the Institute of Radio Engineers and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers

The IRE concerned mostly radio engineering The major interests of the AIEE were wire communications and light and power systems As technology developing the IRE and the AIEE became difficult to distinguish And people who belong to both group were increasing gradually After World War II the leadership of both the IRE and the AIEE merged the organizations on January 1 1963

IEEE says its purpose is scientific and educational directed toward the advancement of the theory and practice of electrical electronics communications and computer engineering as well as computer science the allied branches of engineering and the related arts and sciences In pursuing these goals the IEEE serves a major publisher of scientific journals provides learning opportunities within the engineering sciences research and technology and so on

IEEE consists of 150 countries 350000 members 39 societies organized around specialized technical fields with more than 300 local organizations that hold regular meetings Famous presidents of IEEE and its founding organizations include Elihu Thomson Alexander Graham Bell Ernst Weber The current president of IEEE is Lewis M Terman 

IEEE produces 30 percent of the worlds literature in the electrical and electronics engineering and computer science fields publishing well over 100 peer reviewed journals

The content in these journals as well as the content from several hundred annual conferences are available in the IEEEs online digital library

IEEE is one of the leading standards making organizations in the world The IEEE Standards Association makes and maintains standards for the IEEE IEEE standards affect a wide range of industries including power and energy biomedical and healthcare Information Technology telecommunications transportation nanotechnology information assurance and many more In 2005 IEEE had close to 900 active standards with 500 standards under development One of the more notable IEEE standards is the IEEE 802 LANMAN group of standards which includes the IEEE 8023 Ethernet standard and the IEEE 80211 Wireless Networking standard

A galvanometer is a type of ammeter It is an instrument for detecting and measuring electric current It is an analog electromechanical transducer that produces a rotary deflection through a limited arc in response to electric current flowing through its coil The term has been expanded to include uses of the same mechanism in recording positioning and servomechanism equipment

The most familiar use is as an analog measuring instrument often called a meter It is used to measure the direct current through an electric circuit The DArsonvalWeston form used today is constructed with a small pivoting coil of wire in the field of a permanent magnet The coil is attached to a thin pointer that traverses a calibrated scale A tiny torsion spring pulls the coil and pointer to the zero position

When a direct current flows through the coil the coil generates a magnetic field This field acts against the permanent magnet The coil twists pushing against the spring and moves the pointer The hand points at a scale indicating the electric current Careful design of the pole pieces ensures that the magnetic field is uniform so that the angle of the pointer is proportional to the current A useful meter generally contains provision for damping the mechanical resonance of the moving coil and pointer so that the pointer settles quickly to its position without oscillation

A tangent galvanometer is an early measuring instrument used for the measurement of electric current It works by using a compass needle to compare a magnetic field generated by the unknown current to the magnetic field of the Earth It gets its name from its operating principle the tangent law of magnetism which states that the tangent of the angle a compass needle makes is proportional to the ratio of the strengths of the two perpendicular magnetic fields It was first described by Claude Servais Mathias Pouillet in 1837

A tangent galvanometer consists of a coil of insulated copper wire wound on a circular non magnetic frame The frame is mounted vertically on a horizontal base provided with levelling screws The coil can be rotated on a vertical axis passing through its centre A compass box is mounted horizontally at the centre of a circular scale It consists of a tiny powerful magnetic needle pivoted at the centre of the coil The magnetic needle is free to rotate in the horizontal plane The circular scale is divided into four quadrants Each quadrant is graduated from 0 to 90 A long thin aluminium pointer is attached to the needle at its centre and at right angle to it To avoid errors due to parallax a plane mirror is mounted below the compass needle

Magnetic tape a long and narrow strip of plastic that thin magnetic material is coated on Nearly all recording tape is of this type whether used for recording audio or video or computer data storage

Magnetic tape recording uses magnetic tape which moves on a recording head Electrical signals are fed to the recording head inducing a pattern of magnetization similar to the signal A playback head can then pick up the changes in magnetic field from the tape and convert it into an electrical signal

Devices that record and playback audio and video using magnetic tape are generally called tape recorders and video tape recorders respectively A device that stores computer data on magnetic tape can be called a tape drive a tape unit or a streamer Autoloaders and tape libraries are frequently used to automate cartridge handling

Magnetic tape was first invented for recording sound by Fritz Pfleumer in 1928 in Germany Pfleumers invention used an iron oxide powder coating on a long strip of paper

Magnetic tape has been used for data storage for over 50 years In this time many advances in tape have been made Modern magnetic tape is most commonly packaged in cartridges and cassettes 

Today many other technologies like CD or DVD are replacing magnetic tape However innovation in the technology continues and tape is still widely used

When storing large amounts of data tape can be cheaper than disk or other data storage options Tape storage has always been used with large computer systems Modern usage is a high capacity medium for backups and archives As of 2008 the highest capacity tape cartridge can store 1 TB of data without using compression

But magnetic tape has quite a long wait time for random accesses since the deck must wind the tape to move from one data to another

A cathode is an electrode through which electrons flow into an electrical device such as a battery In other words a cathode is a positive electrode on a battery and a negative electrode on an electrolytic cell Electric current is perceived as flowing in the opposite direction that the electrons are flowing So electrons go into the terminal of a battery but electric current goes out Electrons go into the  terminal of an electrolytic cell but electric current goes out

An electrode through which electrons flows out of the device is termed an anode because it is negatively charged An anode is a negative electrode on a battery and a positive electrode on an electrolytic cell 

The United States Army Reserve is the reserve force of the United States Army People in the reserve forces are not full time soldiers they also have a civilian career The reserve forces of the US Army are made of the US Army reserve and the Army National Guard

The Army Reserve was formed in 1908 to provide a reserve of medical officers to the Army After the First World War Congress reorganized the US land forces The National Defence Act of 4 June 1920 authorized a Regular Army a National Guard and an Organized Reserve of unrestricted size The Organized Reserve later became the Army Reserve

The electrical telegraph is a telegraph that uses electric signals In general the term electrical telegraph refers to a signalling system where an operator makes and breaks an electrical contact with a telegraph key which results in an audible signal at the other end produced by a telegraph sounder which is interpreted and transcribed by a human

Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber installed a 1000m long wire above the towns roofs They were allowed to do this on 6 May 1833 Carl August Steinheil was able to build a telegraph network in 1835 6 He installed a telegraph line along the first German railroad in 1835

The telegraph had a transmitting device which had a keyboard with 16 black and white keys These served for switching the electric current

Dr David Alter created it one year before the much more popular Morse telegraph was invented Alter demonstrated it publically

In the United States the telegraph was developed by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail Morse created an electrical telegraph in 1837 His version was a design that could transmit over long distances using poor quality wire Vail his assistant developed the Morse code signalling alphabet with Morse

Knol is a Google project which aims to include user written articles on a range of topics The project was announced on December 13 2007 and opened in beta to the public on July 23 2008 When it was opened there were a few hundred articles mostly about health and medicine

Knol pages are meant to be the first thing someone who searches for this topic for the first time will want to read according to Manber The term knol which Google defines as a unit of knowledge refers to both the project and an article in the project Several experts see Knol as Googles attempt to compete with Wikipedia while others point out the differences between the projects

Anyone can create and own new knols There can also be several articles on the same topic each written by a different author Because multiple articles can have the same title readers find a topic by searching rather than just by title The authors can say who can edit their articles the public other authors or only themselves They may also choose to include ads from Googles AdSense to their knols Knol has a policy that specifies topics that are unacceptable for the project Relevant nudity is allowed but pornography commercial or otherwise is forbidden Also forbidden is discriminatory or violent content Content designed to promote businesses products or services is allowed but articles devoid of substantive content and created solely to generate ad revenue are not

In its early stages of development as a resource Knol was criticised very much Commentators have called it a wasteland of articles copied from other sources entries that were outdated or abandoned as well as spam or self promotion Knol is frequently criticized for having incomplete and inaccurate articlesCite weburlhttpwwwtechcrunchcom20081030google knol opens up to other languages workTechCrunch dateOctober 30 2008 titleGoogle Knol Opens In French German and Italianref Google has said that Since knol authors receive attribution knols are a great forum for expressing your opinions In October 2008 Google unveiled using Knols as a forum for debate and enabled French Italian and German versions in the face of stagnating traffic

Anyone who wants to contribute to Knol must first sign in with a Google account The users should give their real names If permission is given Google will check if the name is true Google will do this by credit card or phone Google believes that knowing who wrote what will significantly help users make better use of web content The company hopes that knols will include the opinions and points of view of the authors who will put their reputation on the line

Readers who are logged in with a google account can comment on entries rate them or suggest changes This works much like a blog When the project was announced Manber said that Google will not serve as an editor in any way and will not bless any content All editorial responsibilities and control will rest with the authors

All knols are licensed by default under the Creative Commons CC BY 30 license This license allows anyone to reuse the material as long as the original author is named but authors may choose the CC BY NC 30 license or traditional all rights reserved copyright protections instead 

Knol has nofollow outgoing links using an HTML directive This prevents links in its articles from influencing search engine rankings

People have described Knol as a rival to other encyclopedia sites such as Wikipedia and Scholarpedia Sometimes people pointed out that the format was very different and therefore it might be an addition to these sites It might allow to get around some of the Problems of Wikipedia The non profit Wikimedia Foundation which owns the name Wikipedia and the servers hosting the Wikipedia projects welcomed the Google Knol initiative saying that The more good free content the better for the world While Wikipedia articles are written collectively under a neutral point of view policy

There has been debate whether Google search results can remain neutral because of possible conflict of interest According to Danny Sullivan the editor of Search Engine Land Googles goal of making Knol pages easy to find on search engines could conflict with its need to remain unbiased Jeff Chester executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy raised similar concerns At the end of the day theres a fundamental conflict between the business Google is in and its social goals What youre seeing here slowly is Google embracing an advertising driven model in which money will have a greater impact on what people have ready access to

Wikipedia is a very large project that wants to make a free encyclopedia This encyclopedia is written by volunteers This approach has been criticised The main points of criticism are

Only a certain group of people edit Wikipedia For this reason the opinions of that group and their interests may be covered more in Wikipedia This is usually called a system bias and is a bad thing to have There are also certain forms of group dynamics that are present This means that the group of editors as a whole is more occupied to please itself than to edit articles

Robert McHenry said that Wikipedia should not call itself an encyclopedia He thinks that this word also means that there is a degree of authority and accountability and that a resource anyone can change cannot have this McHenry argues that

Orlowski often criticized Wikipedia In December 2005 he wrote on an OpEd at The Register

For sure a libel is a libel but the outrage would have been far more muted if the Wikipedia project didnt make such grand claims for itself The problem with this vanity exercise is one that its largely created for itself The public has a firm idea of what an encyclopedia is and its a place where information can generally be trusted or at least slightly more trusted than what a labyrinthine mysterious bureaucracy can agree upon and surely more trustworthy than a piece of spontaneous graffitiand Wikipedia is a king sized cocktail of the two

A number of academics such as Sarah Deutch dean of social sciences and professor of history at Duke University and Margaret Humphries professor of history and associate clinical professor of medicine at Duke have criticized Wikipedia for its perceived failure as a reliable source A related if somewhat ad hominem criticism is that many Wikipedia editors do not have degrees or other credentials generally recognized in academia The use of Wikipedia is not accepted in many schools and universities in writing a formal paper Several educational institutions have blocked Wikipedia in the past while others have limited its use to only a pointer to external sources University of Maryland professor of physics Robert L Park has characterized Wikipedia as a target for purveyors of pseudoscience

Some academic journals do refer to Wikipedia articles but they do not do this the same way as traditional references For example Wikipedia articles have been referenced in enhanced perspectives provided on line in the journal Science The first of these perspectives to provide a hyperlink to Wikipedia was A White Collar Protein Senses Blue Light Dozens of enhanced perspectives have provided such links since then The publisher of Science says that these enhanced perspectives include hypernotes  which link directly to websites of other relevant information available online  beyond the standard bibliographic references

Some librarians academics and editors of other encyclopedias consider it to have little utility as a reference work Most university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work preferring primary sources One university program and several schools have even banned Wikipedia citations specifically 

Wikipedias policies state that assertions should be supported by reliable published sourcesideally by peer reviewed publications Jimmy Wales the de facto leader of Wikipedia stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate as primary sources and should not be relied upon as authoritative

A pessimist is someone who follows pessimism

Pessimists usually look at the negative side of life They are opposite of optimists Some people are known for being a pessimist because they always look at the bad things in life  most people are negative at least some of the time

An optimist is someone who always tries to look at the positive side of life An optimist follows the philosophy of optimism An optimist is the opposite of a pessimist 

An example of optimism would be seeing the glass as half full rather than half empty

Tonbridge Grammar School is a well known grammar school in Tonbridge Kent It has about 1050 students who are 11 18 years old The school was called Tonbridge Grammar School For Girls until 2002 when boys were allowed into the 6th form

Tonbridge Grammar School started in 1905 on the top floor of the Tonbridge Library with only 13 pupils The teacher and headmistress was called Mrs Taylor In 1913 the school moved to the site in Deakin Leas as the school was growing quickly and the library was not big enough

These are the main buildings found at TGS today

A rechargeable battery or a storage battery is a kind of battery that can be restored to full charge by the use of electrical energy It is also called Secondary cell because people recharged it with Primary cell when there was no generator

Rechargeable battery compared with disposable battery has many environmental and economical advantages because it can be discharged and recharged many times But it costs more to produce and contains more toxic chemicals than a disposable battery

Rechargeable batteries are used for many mobile machines like MP3 player portable media player mobile phone electronic dictionary etc

The 2005 Pacific hurricane season was a slightly inactive season that produced 17 tropical cyclones It officially started on May 15 and ended on November 30 dates which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the northeast Pacific Ocean The first tropical cyclone Hurricane Adrian developed on May 17 while the last storm Tropical Depression Sixteen E dissipated on October 20 During the year a total of 17 tropical cyclones 15 tropical storms 7 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes formed The most intense hurricane Hurricane Kenneth remained out over open waters for the duration of its existence However the remnants of the storm caused minor flooding on the Island of Hawaii September was the most active month of the year as 6 of the 17 tropical cyclones formed during this time 

The pre season forecast from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration called for 11 15 named storms and 6 8 hurricanes of which 2 4 were expected to attain major hurricane status

Very few storms impacted land throughout the season Hurricane Adrian was the only landfalling system It struck El Salvador as a dissipating tropical depression after rapidly weakening from hurricane status Flooding in Nicaragua caused the only fatality during the season Tropical Storm Dora and Hurricane Hilary brought tropical storm force winds to coastal Mexico although no damage was reported The remnants Tropical Depression One C caused heavy rainfall on the Island of Hawaii peaking at 88 in Hawaii was also affected by the remnants of Hurricane Kenneth which also caused heavy rains on the Island of Hawaii The combined storms caused very little damage and only one fatality

The 2007 Pacific hurricane season was an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation It officially started on May 15 2007 in the eastern Pacific designated as the area east of 140W and on June 1 2007 in the central Pacific which is between the International Date Line and 140W and lasted until November 30 2007 These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Pacific basin

The season began slowly through the end of July the seasonal ACE was the third lowest since the geostationary satellite era began in 1966 The inactivity continued through the next month which was the third quietest August in terms of ACE since reliable records began in the basin in 1971 Tropical Storm Barbara in June caused 55 million in crop damage in southeastern Mexico from heavy precipitation In August Hurricane Flossie formed in the Eastern Pacific and crossed into the Central Pacific threatening Hawaii but causing little damage In early September Hurricane Henriette dropped heavy rainfall in southwest Mexico which caused nine fatalities and 25 million in damage

The Klingon language is a language that was made for the Klingons in the Star Trek universe It is an invented language This means that there is no country that uses the language Only few people can really speak the Klingon language The Klingon Language Institute helps people learn Klingon

The first Klingon words were made by the actor James Doohan in 1979 for the first Star Trek movie When they made the third movie in 1984 Gene Roddenberry wanted to have a real language for the Klingons So it was the linguist Marc Okrand who made the Klingon language He has written some books about the Klingon language

The Klingon language feels like talking backwards Marc Okrand wanted the language to be as complicated as possible He did this to make it sound very extraterrestrial The word order in a sentence is always object verb subject So the English sentence I see the cat is said as the cat see I in Klingon

I am wary of giving the flag to Matilda here She seems cold and disinterested on some of the pages she edits and cannot resolve agreements easily Whether or not these issues are due to inability to work well with a small community or even a dogmatic personality it is a trait needed to resolve arguments quickly when wishing to become an administrator

Her edit count is also worrisome but not very Many edits are to Wikipediatalk Wikipedia and talk pages justifying what I have said above about lengthy arguments without clean quick resolutions Her mainspace edits are rather low however they are quality edits and generally quality comes before quantity  Gwib  2144 24 November 2008

The 1996 Pacific hurricane season was an event in tropical cyclone formation and the second least active Pacific hurricane season in recorded history behind only 1977 It officially began May 15 1996 in the eastern north Pacific and on June 1 1996 in the central north Pacific It ended on November 30 1996 These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean

Few notable storms formed this season however it was very eventful Twelve tropical cyclones formed during this season of which five made landfall and two other impacted land areas Two tropical cyclones that formed in other basins entered the eastern north Pacific Ocean Early in the season three tropical cyclones impacted Mexico in a ten day span while the first cyclone of the season formed before it officially began Hurricane Douglas was the strongest storm reaching Category 4 intensity on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale and had its beginnings in the Atlantic as Hurricane Douglas

Alma was the first of three consecutive storms to come close to or make landfall on the Pacific coast of Mexico during a ten day span Alma killed at least three people and possibly twenty Three were killed when a house near Lazaro Cardenas collapsed There were unconfirmed reports that 17 people were killed by floods in Puebla from rains related to Alma Trees were downed and power was knocked out to many places Roads were flooded and covered with Debris

Hurricane Boris was the second consecutive storm to approach close to Mexico It made landfall halfway between Acapulco and Lazaro Cardenas on June 29 It killed ten people A flood caused by Boris on the San Jeronimo River left thousands homeless

Cristina was the third cyclone to come close to Mexico in the space of ten days It killed a fisherman when his boat was caught at sea off Oaxaca At least 11 other fishing boats and 22 people were missing Their fate is unknown

Hurricane Douglas was a continuation of Atlantic Hurricane Cesar which crossed Central America Continuing Cesars nearly due west heading it was still a tropical storm when it entered the Pacific on July 29 and quickly regained hurricane status 

Douglass strengthened over the next two days as it turned west northwest paralleling the coast of Mexico It reached its peak intensity on August 1with winds of 135 mph and a central pressure of 946 millibars making it the strongest hurricane of the season It slow weakening began on August 2 as it entered cooler waters and it officially dissipated on August 6 though like many Pacific hurricanes a remnant circulation could be tracked westward for several days afterward 

The precursor disturbance to Fausto was first noticed over Venezuela as early as August 31 and may have been related to the tropical wave that spawned Hurricane Fran By September 4 the wave had crossed Central America into the Pacific it steadily organized until it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fausto on September 10 

Fausto intensified rapidly after it reached hurricane intensity on the 12th peaking with sustained winds of 120 mph and a minimum central pressure of 955 millibars  The hurricane weakened as an approaching trough increased shear over the storm this same trough also turned the storm north on the 13th where it made landfall as a minimal hurricane Baja California that day On September 14 the storm turned northeastward across the Gulf of California and dissipated inland over the Sierra Madre range after its second landfall as a hurricane Its extratropical remnants flared up briefly over northern Mexico and Texas but otherwise soon lost their identity

Damage in Mexico was relatively minor with only a single casualty caused by a downed power line

Hurricane Hernan made landfall in a thinly populated region of Mexico It washed out roads and knocked down power lines and telephone poles There were 100 injuries but no deaths

The 2002 Pacific hurricane season was an event in tropical cyclone meteorology The most notable storm this year was Hurricane Kenna which reached Category 5 on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale It made landfall near Puerto Vallarta Jalisco Mexico on October 25 It killed four people and was one of the most powerful hurricanes to ever strike the western coast of Mexico Elsewhere Tropical Storm Julio made landfall in Mexico and Tropical Storm Boris dumped torrential rain along the Mexican coast although it remained offshore 

Other storms were individually unusual Hurricanes Elida and Hernan also reached Category 5 intensity but neither did any damage Hurricane Fausto while it had no effect on land regenerated into a tiny tropical storm at a very high latitude

It officially started May 15 2002 in the eastern Pacific and June 1 2002 in the central Pacific and lasted until November 30 2002 These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean

There were twelve tropical storms in the eastern Pacific Ocean this season Of those six became hurricanes and five became major hurricanes by reaching Category 3 or high on the Saffir Simpson Scale A record three Category 5 storms formed In the central Pacific one tropical storm one hurricane and one major hurricane formed The season saw below average activity in terms of the number of systems but above average activity in terms of stronger storms This was due to a moderately strong El Nio that also suppressed activity in the Atlantic Ocean

Also of note this season is an unusual gap in storm formation during the first three weeks of August That time usually sees several nameable storms but for some reason there were none

On June 8 an area of disturbed weather that had absorbed a tropical wave spawned Tropical Depression Two E It became a tropical storm the next day After peaking on June 9 steering currents collapsed and Boris stalled out in the ocean between two ridges of high pressure Shear increased and the cyclone weakened to a depression on June 10 The next day Boris degenerated into a remnant low The remnant drifted east and then southeast before dissipating on June 12

Boris dumped heavy rains on sections of the Mexican coast Several homes at an unspecified location were damaged There were no deathsrefNHCBoris

An area of convection and disturbed weather possibly related to outflow from Hurricane Isidore developed a circulation on September 23 and organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen E on September 25 The depression headed northward and strengthened into a tropical storm the same day Julio turned to the northwest and peaked just before landfall near Lazaro Cardenas on September 26 The storm quickly dissipated over Mexico

No one was killed by Julio Around 100 houses in Acapulco and Zihuatanejo were damaged or washed away by flash floodingrefNHCJulio

A powerful Category 5 hurricane at its peak the third of the season Kenna made landfall on Mexico as a Category 4 As of 2005 it is the most recent Pacific hurricane to have its name retired

Kenna killed four people in Mexico and left thousands homeless Its total damage was from 5 to 100 million dollars

Eleven E threatened land It resulted in warnings and watches being issued for parts of the Baja California Peninsula but it weakened to a remnant low before strengthening into a storm No deaths or damages were reported Eleven E was the final storm of the season It lasted for two days in November and dissipated on the sixteenth day of that month

Hurricane Kenna was a destructive hurricane of the 2002 Pacific hurricane season It was one of the strongest Pacific hurricanes to ever strike Mexico

Kenna formed in the eastern Pacific on October 22 It strengthened rapidly reaching category five on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale on October 25 Hurricane Kenna weakened to category four before striking land near Puerto Vallarta later that day The only Pacific hurricanes to strike Mexico at greater intensity were 1976s Hurricane Madeline and an unnamed 1959 storm

Officials reported four deaths from Hurricane Kenna

The 1994 Pacific hurricane season officially started on May 15 1994 in the eastern Pacific and on June 1 1994 in the central Pacific and lasted until November 30 1994 These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean

Of note in this season is an unusual spree of very intense storms Hurricanes Emilia Gilma John and Olivia all reached a pressure below 930 millibars Elsewhere Hurricane Rosa killed several people in Mexico

This season had slightly above average activity Five hurricanes reached Category 2 intensity or higher on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale In addition there were four other hurricanes and eight tropical storms In the Central Pacific two tropical storms and one hurricane formed

Hurricane Emilia was a powerful Category 4 storm It briefly threatened the Hawaiian Islands near peak strength but instead encountered wind shear and weakened There was minor damage to roofs and some downed trees and moderate rainfall

Hurricane Gilma was the strongest storm of the season and the first Category 5 storm in the East Pacific since Ava in 1973 It is also the strongest July storm in the east Pacific and is the fifth strongest overall

Hurricane John was the longest lasting and most continuous tropical cyclone on Earth in recorded history Its life began on August 11 south of Mexico and 31 days later the storm became extratropical south of Alaska after reaching Category 5 strength and passing the International Date Line twice John caused 15 million in damage on Johnston Island

An area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression on August 9 while located 740 miles southeast of Hilo Hawaii The depression moved westward without organizing and dissipated on the 14th Moisture from the system produced heavy rainfall over the island of Hawaii totaling to over 15 inches The flooding closed all major roads in Hilo and was considered the worst flooding in 40 years The rainfall destroyed 2 homes and damaged 214 14 severely It also damaged roads and businesses Damage throughout the island totaled to 5 million Flooding occurred in Maui as well where landslides blocked portions of the Hana Highway 

Hurricane Olivia was the second strongest storm of the season It is one of the ten most intense east Pacific hurricanes ever recorded At the time it was the strongest October storm

An area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression at midday on October 8 It had trouble organizing and advisories were discontinued for a while The cyclone finally became a tropical storm on October 11 and was named Rosa It moved glacially but eventually a trough steered Rosa north and then northeast Rosa intensified quickly peaking at Category 2 intensity just before landfall near La Concepcion on the morning of October 14 Rosa quickly decayed over the mountains of Mexico and its cloud shield rapidly accelerated northward through the Plains and Mississippi Valley moistening the atmosphere enough in Texas ahead of a slow moving occluded cyclone to help set the stage for a significant flood event in east Texas on the October 17

Four deaths two in each of Nayarit and Durango were reported Four people were missing in Sinaloa More than 100000 people had their homes damaged in Nayarit Telephone poles and power lines were downed in Sinaloa Rain caused landslides and flash flooding in mountainous areas

The precursor to Hurricane John was a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on July 25th It moved across the unfavorable Atlantic and reached the Eastern Pacific on August 8th It slowly organized and became Tropical Depression 10 E on August 11th 300 nautical miles south southeast of Acapulco Mexico Conditions were not ideal for development but it developed banding features and well defined outflow and managed to strengthen to become Tropical Storm John later that day

A strong ridge of high pressure over the Northeastern Pacific Ocean forced John westward where upper level shear kept John a tropical storm as its intensity fluctuated The shear greatly lessened greatly on the 19th and John became a hurricane on the 20th Later that day it became a major hurricane and crossed into the Central Pacific shortly thereafter

Hurricane John continued to strengthen and reached a peak of 150 knots on the 23rd passing 300 nautical miles south of Hawaii John had posed a threat to the island days before but the ridge of high pressure pushed John safely south of the island The hurricane still caused heavy waves and rains though During these days Johns intensity was constantly checked by Air Force Reserve aircraft reconnaissance

John turned more northerly where it steadily weakened to a minimal hurricane on the 26th Then it crossed just north of Johnston Island where it caused moderate damage Conditions again favored strengthening and John re strengthened to a 135 mph Category 4 hurricane but upper level shear again weakened it John crossed the International Date Line and became Typhoon John

The system continued to weaken becoming a tropcial storm on the 31st and a tropical depression on the 2nd while drifting eastward John looped back to the northwest and gradually restrengthened An upper trough pulled the storm to the northeast on the 7th and re entered the Central Pacific on the 8th John became a hurricane again late on the 8th and retained that intensity for another day Upper level shear weakened the hurricane to a tropical storm on the 10th and John became extratropical in the North Central Pacific about a thousand miles south of Unalaska Island John dissipated later that day after an unprecedented 31 days at sea

Hurricane Paka was the last tropical cyclone in the 1997 Pacific hurricane and typhoon season and was among the strongest Pacific typhoons in the month of December Paka which is the Hawaiian name for Pat developed on November 28 from a trough well to the southwest of Hawaii The storm tracked generally westward for much of its duration and on December 7 it crossed into the western Pacific Ocean Much of its track was characterized by fluctuations in intensity and on December 10 the cyclone attained typhoon status as it crossed the Marshall Islands On December 16 Paka struck Guam and Rota with winds of 230 kmh and it strengthened further to reach peak winds on December 18 over open waters Subsequently it underwent a steady weakening trend and on December 23 Paka dissipated

Typhoon Paka first impacted the Marshall Islands where it dropped heavy rainfall and left 80 million in damage Later it passed just north of Guam where strong winds destroyed about 1500 buildings and damaged 10000 more 5000 people were left homeless and the island experienced a complete power outage following the typhoon Damage on the island totaled 500 million which warranted the retirement of its name Paka also caused light damage in the Northern Marianas Islands and overall the storm caused no reported deaths

Hurricane Pauline was a destructive hurricane of the 1997 Pacific hurricane season and one of the deadliest Pauline formed in the eastern Pacific on October 6 It strengthened rapidly reaching category four on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale on the next day After a brief period of weakening to a category three it re intensified back to a category four moving roughly parallel to the Mexican coast Pauline then made landfall slamming into Mexico Heavy rains and high winds caused damage as the storm skirted the coast There were 300 400 deaths and heavy damage to Acalpulco The name was retired and replaced by Patricia for the 2003 Pacific hurricane season

Hurricane Linda of 1997 was the strongest hurricane ever seen in the east Pacific with continued winds of 160 knots and gusting to 190 knots and a central pressure of 900 mbar It was part of an abnormally active season for both the Eastern and Western Pacific Basins

Since it was far from land it did not cause much damage

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 24th It moved across the unfavorable Atlantic without development As it crossed Central America convection increased and a poorly defined center developed early on September 9th Banding and convection increased and it became a tropical depression that night 400 nautical miles south of Manzanillo Mexico

Tropical Depression 14 E continued northwestward and became a tropical storm on the 10th Linda started to intensify more quickly becoming a hurricane on the 11th 475 nautical miles south southeast of the southern tip of Baja California After 30 hours of rapidly intensifying Linda reached her peak of 160 knots on the 12th or around 185 MPH winds That is an increase of 95 knots and a drop of 85 millibars Linda moved directly over Socorro Island on the 12th as a Category 5 hurricane but cooler waters weakened it greatly dissipating it on the 17th

Linda went over Soccoro Island doing 32 million in damage

In California Linda was responsible for 8 deaths and 68 million in damage Five people drowned in a jetty Floods caused 3 deaths and mudslides destroyed millions of homes and caused 68 million in damage The Southwest would get devastated again by Hurricane Nora weeks later

Hurricane Ioke is the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Central Pacific The first storm to form in the Central Pacific in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season Ioke is a long lived and extremely powerful storm that traversed the Pacific reaching Category 5 status twice as a hurricane As a typhoon Ioke managed to achieve Category 5 equivalent one minute sustained winds one more time before weakening

Ioke did not affect any permanently populated areas in the Central Pacific or Western Pacific basins as a hurricane or a typhoon but the storm passed over Johnston Atoll as a Category 2 hurricane and Wake Island as a Category 5 typhoon Despite its strength Ioke only caused moderate damage to Wake Island and was not responsible for any fatalities

The system began in the third week of August as a persistent tropical disturbance south of the Hawaiian Islands It was initially embedded in a trough but gained convection and developed into a tropical depression about 775 miles south of Honolulu on August 19 It continued to strengthen and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center designated the system with the name Ioke which is Hawaiian for the name Joyce becoming the first tropical storm to form in the Central Pacific since 2002 

Ioke quickly began to enter a process of rapid development strengthening into a hurricane just 24 hours after it had formed While safely avoiding the Hawaiian Islands it continued to rapidly intensify and became a major hurricane on the morning of August 21 Later that day Ioke intensified even further into a Category 4 hurricane On August 22 it began to weaken as a result of cooler water and eyewall replacement cycles and was downgraded back to a Category 2 As a Category 2 storm Ioke affected Johnston Atoll

The storm began to rapidly deepen again late on August 23 as it moved over increasingly warm water reaching major hurricane status for the second time while moving to the west northwest From there conditions would become even more favorable for development

Overnight between August 24 and August 25 Ioke strengthened rapidly becoming a Category 5 hurricane on the 25th  the first system originating from the Central Pacific to reach that intensity while still in the Western Hemisphere Ioke then began to travel over a large environment highly favorable for hurricane development and would maintain its strength for an extended period of time Ioke also became the most intense hurricane ever to develop in the Central Pacific with a central pressure of 921 mbar at that point

Ioke began to fluctuate in intensity afterward weakened back to a Category 4 while undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle regaining Category 5 strength on August 26 Ioke held that intensity until crossing the International Date Line that evening becoming Typhoon Ioke in the process The storm weakened to Category 4 strength according to the JTWC but by 2100 UTC on August 29 the JTWC advised that Ioke had regained Category 5 strength for the third time

After maintaining Category 5 strength for 12 hours Ioke weakened back to a Category 4 for the final time on August 30 while approaching Wake Island Ioke passed almost directly over the island on early September 1 and continued tracking to the west northwest while slowly weakening over gradually cooling waters On September 3 under the influence of an approaching trough the typhoon began to recurve to the northwest then to the north and away from Japan while weakening more rapidly Ioke began to transition into an extratropical storm late on September 4 due to increased wind shear and rapidly cooling seas and the JTWC issued its last advisory at 1200 UTC on September 5 after it was decided that Ioke had begun extratropical transition The JMA followed suit early on September 7 after Ioke had become completely extratropical east of the Kamchatka Peninsula

The remnant extratropical low is currently monitored by National Weather Service and is expected to be near Alaska in 48 hours

Despite Iokes extreme intensity and impacting two small land masses damage was surprisingly moderate Little damage was done on Johnston Atoll and damage to infrastructure on Wake Island was less than expected despite Iokes eyewall brushing the island

The National Weather Service reported that the eastern eyewall of Ioke passed over the uninhabited Johnston Atoll buffeting it with hurricane force winds 

Twelve people on a United States Air Force vessel in the Pacific were forced to abandon ship and take shelter in a hurricane proof bunker on the island They were reported safe the next day and a reconnaissance flight reported little damage on the island

Due to Typhoon Iokes projected path near Wake Island all 188 people who live and work there were evacuated in two C 17 Globemaster IIIs to Oahu in Hawaii The typhoons powerful winds estimated to gust as high as 190 mph damaged weather sensors on the island causing them to fail after the instruments reported a 100 mph gust A reconnaissance mission by the Coast Guard indicated the typhoon caused moderate damage on the island including blown off roofs damaged sides of buildings and downed trees However the damage was repairable and the major infrastructure on the island was intact

The JMA issued evacuation orders for its staff on Minami Torishima on September 1 in view of the approaching typhoon but so far no damage has been reported

In Computer science a closure is a function that has an environment of its own Inside this environment there is at least one bound variable Closures were first used in programming languages such as ML and Lisp

Closures keep the state of their bound variables over several invocations

The term closure is often mistakenly used to mean anonymous function This is probably because most languages implementing anonymous functions allow them to form closures and programmers are usually introduced to both concepts at the same time These are however different concepts

The concept of closures was developed in the 1960s and was first fully implemented as a language feature in the programming language Scheme Since then many languages have been designed to support closures

Function objects are sometimes also called closures

In this example the lambda expression appears within the function best selling books When the lambda expression is evaluated Scheme creates a closure consisting of the code for the lambda and a reference to the threshold variable which is a free variable inside the lambda

The closure is then passed to the filter function which calls it repeatedly to determine which books are to be added to the result list and which are to be discarded Because the closure itself has a reference to threshold it can use that variable each time filter calls it The function filter itself might be defined in a completely separate file

The function keyword is used here instead of lambda and an Arrayfilter method instead of a global filter function but otherwise the structure and the effect of the code are the same

A function may create a closure and return it The following example is a function that returns a function

Because the closure in this case outlives the scope of the function that creates it the variables f and dx live on after the function derivative returns In languages without closures the lifetime of a local variable coincides with the execution of the scope where that variable is declared In languages with closures variables must continue to exist as long as any existing closures have references to them This is most commonly implemented using some form of garbage collection

In this example the function named gradient forms a closure together with the variables f and dx This closure is then returned by the outer function named derivative In fact closures in Python must often be formed using named functions where an anonymous function might be equally appropriate in other languages because of the restrictions on lambda forms

Closures have many uses

let prints none prints meet me by the docks at midnight 

Note Some speakers call any data structure that binds a lexical environment a closure but the term usually refers specifically to functions

Commedia dellArte is a form of improvisational theatre that began in Italy in the 16th century It continued to be popular during the 17th century and is still popular today Commedia dellArte is Italian for Comedy of Art Outside Italy it was known as Italian Comedy 

The plays of Commedia dellArte were often performed by a small group of actors who travelled around and performed in town squares The actors would pass a hat round for people to put money in The words of the plays were mostly never written down 

The earliest known company was in Padua in 1545 By the turn of the seventeenth century there were several troupes such as the Gelosi Confidenti and Fedeli Some troupes were popular at foreign courts especially in France where images from the commedia became a favorite theme of well known artists

The actors often wore masks The stories were often about people being cunning Hunger love and money were important in the stories There were several characters who often appeared in lots of the stories These are called stock characters Examples of stock characters from Commedia dellArte are Harlequin Pantalone Arlecchino Colombina Pulcinella Pierrot Scaramuccia

Commedia dellArte had a lot of influence on theatre plays in many countries Punch and Judy shows popular with children in Britain and other countries are similar to Commedia dellarte They also have stock characters Punch Judy the crocodile the policeman etc

A cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator invented by Ernest Lawrence from the University of California Berkeley in 1930

Cyclotrons use perpendicular magnetic field to bend electrons and particles through into a semicircular path by an applied electric field The applied electric field accelerates electrons between the D electrodes of the magnetic field region

The accelerating electric field reverses just at the time the electrons finish their half circle so that it accelerates them across the gap With a higher speed they move in a larger semicircle After repeating this process several times they come out the exit port at a high speed

A moving charge in a cyclotron will move in a circular path under the influence of a constant magnetic field If the time to complete one orbit is calculated

T2rv2mvqBv2mqB

It is found that the period is independent of the radius Therefore if a square wave is applied at angular frequency qBm the charge will spiral outward increasing in speed

When a square wave of angular frequency qBm is applied between the two sides of the magnetic poles the charge will be boosted again at just the right time to accelerate it across the gap Thus the constant cyclotron frequency can continue to accelerate the charge

The Passenger Pigeon or wild pigeon was a species of pigeon that was once the most common bird in North America

The passenger pigeon or wild pigeon was a species of bird Ectopistes migratorius that was once common in North America It lived in enormous migratory flocks sometimes containing more than two billion birds that could stretch one mile wide and 300 miles long across the sky sometimes taking several hours to pass

Some estimate that there were three billion to five billion passenger pigeons in the United States when Europeans arrived in North America Others argue that the species had not been common in the Pre Columbian period but their numbers grew when devastation of the American Indian population by European diseases led to reduced competition for food

The species went from being one of the most usual birds in the world during the 19th century to extinction early in the 20th century At the time passenger pigeons had one of the largest groups or flocks of any animal second only to the Rocky Mountain locust

Some reduction in numbers happened because of habitat loss when the Europeans started settling further inland The primary factor emerged when pigeon meat was commercialized as a cheap food for slaves and the poor in the 19th century resulting in hunting on a massive scale There was a slow decline in their numbers between about 1800 and 1870 followed by a catastrophic decline between 1870 and 1890 Martha thought to be the worlds last passenger pigeon died on September 1 1914 in Cincinnati Ohio

In the 18th century the passenger pigeon in Europe was known to the French as tourtre but in New France the North American bird was called tourte In modern French the bird is known as the pigeon migrateur

In Algonquian languages it was called amimi by the Lenape and omiimii by the Ojibwe The term passenger pigeon in English derives from the French word passager meaning to pass by

Strike was Eisensteins first full length feature film The Battleship Potemkin was well liked by critics throughout the world Because he was known throughout the world Eisenstein was able to direct October The film was part of the tenth anniversary celebration of the October Revolution of 1917 He then directed The General Line People in the outside world praised the films However in the Soviet Union Eisensteins focus on structural issues such as camera angles crowd movements and montage was not liked by the much of the Soviet film community

In the autumn of 1928 Eisenstein left the Soviet Union for a tour of Europe He was joined by Grigori Aleksandrov and cinematographer Eduard Tisse The trip was supposed to allow Eisenstein and others to learn about sound motion pictures It would also show the famous Soviet artists to the capitalist West For Eisenstein however it was also an opportunity to see landscapes and cultures outside those found within the Soviet Union He spent the next two years touring and lecturing in Berlin Zurich London and Paris In 1929 in Switzerland Eisenstein supervised an educational documentary about abortion directed by Edouard Tiss entitled Frauennot  Frauenglck

In late April 1930 Jesse L Lasky working for Paramount Pictures offered Eisenstein the chance to make a film in the United States He accepted a short term contract for 100000 and arrived in Hollywood in May 1930 However this agreement failed Eisensteins approach to filmmaking did not work with the style and way films were made in American film studios

Eisenstein proposed a biography of munitions invester Sir Basil Zaharoff and a film version of Arms and the Man by George Bernard Shaw He also made plans for a film of Sutters Gold by Jack London But the studios producers did not like the plan Paramount then proposed a movie version of Theodore Dreisers An American Tragedy This excited Eisenstein who had read and liked the work and had met Dreiser at one time in Moscow Eisenstein completed a script by the start of October 1930 Paramount disliked it completely They also found themselves intimidated by Major Frank Pease president of the Hollywood Technical Directors Institute Pease an anti communist started a public campaign against Eisenstein On October 23 1930 Paramount and Eisenstein declared their contract canceled Eisenstein and his film partners were given return tickets to Moscow at Paramounts expense

Eisenstein was faced with returning home as a failure The Soviet film industry was solving the sound film issue without him and his films His methods and ideas were becoming increasingly attacked as ideological failures They were called examples of formalism Many of his theoretical articles from this period such as Eisenstein on Disney have been found decades later as important scholarly texts These are used in film schools around the world

Eisenstein spent a large amount of time with Charlie Chaplin Chaplin recommended that Eisenstein meet American socialist author Upton Sinclair who Chaplin thought might help Eisenstein Sinclairs works had been accepted by and were widely read in the Soviet Union and were known to Eisenstein The two liked each others work Between the end of October 1930 and Thanksgiving of that year Sinclair had gotten an extension of Eisensteins leave from the Soviet Union He also received permission for Eisenstein to travel to Mexico to make a film to be produced by Sinclair and his wife Mary Craig Kimbrough Sinclair They joined with three other investors to make the Mexican Film Trust

On November 24 Eisenstein signed a contract with the Trust The deal was upon the basis of Eisensteins desire to be free to direct the making of a picture according to his own ideas of what a Mexican picture should be and in full faith in Eisensteins artistic integrity The contract also said that the film would be non political The money first came from Mrs Sinclair and would be not less than Twenty Five Thousand Dollars The schedule for making the movie would be a period of from three to four months The contract also said that Eisensteinagrees that all pictures made or directed by him in Mexico all negative film and positive prints and all story and ideas embodied in said Mexican picture will be the property of Mrs Sinclair An addition to the contract dated December 1 allowed that the Soviet Government may have the finished film free for showing inside the USSR Reportedly it was verbally decided that the film was expected to be an hour long 

By December 4 1930 Eisenstein was on his way to Mexico by train He was joined by Alexandrov and Tisse Later he came up with a short summary of the six part film which would come This would be the final plan Eisenstein would settle on for his project The title for the project Que viva Mxico was decided on some time later While in Mexico Eisenstein mixed socially with Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera Eisenstein liked these artists and Mexican culture in general They inspired Eisenstein to call his films moving frescoes

After a long time away from the Soviet Union Stalin sent a telegram saying he was worried that Eisenstein had become a deserter Eisenstein blamed Mary Sinclairs younger brother Hunter Kimbrough for the films problems Kimbrough had been sent along to act as a line producer on the film Eisenstein hoped to pressure the Sinclairs to stop Stalin so Eisenstein could finish the film in his own way

The upset Sinclair shut down production He ordered Kimbrough to return to the United States with the remaining film footage The three Soviets came as well to see what they could do with the film already shot For the unfinished filming of the novel of Soldadera Eisenstein had gotten 500 soldiers 10000 guns and 50 cannons from the Mexican Army This was lost due to Sinclairs canceling of production

When Eisenstein arrived at the American border a customs search of his trunk revealed sketches and drawings of Jesus along with other material of a pornographic nature Eisensteins re entry visa had expired and Sinclairs contacts in Washington were unable to secure him an additional extension Eisenstein Alexandrov and Tisse were after a months stay at the US Mexico border outside Laredo Texas allowed a 30 day pass to get from Texas to New York From there they would be allowed to leave for Moscow Kimbrough returned to Los Angeles with the remaining film

Eisenstein toured the American South on his way to New York In mid 1932 the Sinclairs were able to get the services of Sol Lesser Lesser had just opened his own distribution office in New York Principal Distributing Corp Lesser agreed to supervise post production work on the miles of negative at the Sinclairs expense and distribute any finished product Two short feature films and a short subject Thunder Over Mexico based on the Maguey footage Eisenstein in Mexico and Death Day respectively were completed and released in the United States between the autumn of 1933 and early 1934

Eisenstein never saw any of the Sinclair Lesser films nor a later effort by his first biographer Marie Seton called Time In The Sun He would publicly say that he had lost all interest in the project

Eisensteins trip to the west made the Soviet film business look at him with a suspicion that would never completely go away He apparently spent some time in a mental hospital in Kislovodsk in July 1933 This was possibly a result of depression because he realized that he would never be allowed to edit the Mexican footage which was turned over by Sinclair to Hollywood editors

He was then given a teaching job with the film school GIK where he had taught before In 1933 and 1934 he was in charge of writing the education plan Eisenstein married filmmaker and writer Pera Atasheva in 1934 They remained married until his death in 1948 There is some question about his sexuality

In 1935 he began another project Bezhin Meadow It appears the film had many of the same problems as Que Viva Mexico Eisenstein decided to film two versions of the plot One was for adult viewers and one was for children He failed to set a clear shooting schedule He also used a lot of film which meant a lot of costs and missed deadlines The film ran into problems because it was not fully supported by its American financers

The thing that may have saved Eisensteins career at this point was that Stalin ended up saying that the Bezhin Meadow problems along with several other problems facing the business had less to do with Eisensteins approach to filmmaking as with the executives who were supposed to have been watching him In the end this made Boris Shumyatsky executive producer of Soviet film since 1932 to blame In early 1938 he was denounced arrested tried and convicted as a traitor and shot

Eisenstein was then able to impress Stalin again for one more chance and he chose from two offerings the job of a film of Alexander Nevsky with music composed by Sergei Prokofiev This time however he was also given a co writer Pyotr Pavlenko to bring in a completed script He had professional actors to play the roles He also had an assistant director Dmitri Vasilyev to make the filming faster

The result was a film critically received by both the Soviets and in the West He won the Order of Lenin and the Stalin Prize It was an obvious allegory and hard warning against the growing forces of Nazi Germany This was started completed and put in theatres all within 1938 It was Eisensteins first film in nearly a decade It also his first film with sound

But within months of its release Stalin entered into his agreement with Hitler Nevsky was quickly pulled from distribution Eisenstein returned to teaching He was assigned to direct Richard Wagners Die Walkre at the Bolshoi Theatre Eisenstein had to wait until Hitlers sent German troops across the Soviet border in a fatal first strike to see Nevsky receive wide distribution and real international success

With the war coming to Moscow Eisenstein was one of many filmmakers evacuated to Alma Ata There is where he first considered the idea of making a film about Czar Ivan IV Eisenstein wrote letters to Prokofiev from Alma Ata Prokofiev joined him there in 1942 Prokofiev composed the score for Eisensteins film Eisenstein designed sets for an opera version of War and Peace that Prokofiev was creating

Eisensteins film Ivan The Terrible Part I showing Ivan IV of Russia as a national hero was liked by Joseph Stalin The sequel Ivan The Terrible Part II was not approved of by the government All the film from the not finished Ivan The Terrible Part III was taken away and most of it was destroyed

Eisensteins health was also failing He had a heart attack during the making of this film He died soon after of another heart attack at the age of 50 He is buried at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow

Eisenstein was one of the first to use montage a specific form of film editing He and Lev Kuleshov two of the first film theorists said that montage was the basis of film His articles and books especially Film Form and The Film Sense explain the need for montage in detail

His writings and films have continued to have a major impact on later filmmakers Eisenstein believed that editing could be used for more than just explaining a scene or moment through a linkage of related images Eisenstein felt the collision of shots could be used to control the feelings of the audience and create film metaphors He believed that an idea should be concluded from comparing two different shots This is what made a collage or montage within film He developed what he called methods of montage

Eisenstein taught film making during his career at GIK He also wrote the lessons for the directors course there His classroom illustrations are reproduced in Vladimir Nizhnis Lessons with Eisenstein Exercises and examples for students were based on literature such as Honor de Balzacs Le Pre Goriot Another situation students had to produce was the staging of the Haitian struggle for independence as depicted in Anatolii Vinogradovs The Black Consul Eisenstein also taught the specifics of directing photography and editing He encouraged his students development of individuality expressiveness and creativity Eisensteins teaching like his films were politically charged and contained quotes from Vladimir Lenin

In his first films Eisenstein did not use professional actors His narratives did not focus on individual characters Instead they addressed broad social issues especially class conflict He used basic characters and the roles were filled with untrained people from the matching classes He avoided using stars Eisensteins vision of communism brought him into conflict with officials in the ruling system of Joseph Stalin Like many Bolshevik artists Eisenstein pictured a new society which would pay for artists totally This would free them from bosses and budgets It would leave them free to create But budgets and producers were as important to the Soviet film business as the rest of the world The isolated post revolution new nation did not have the resources to nationalize its film business at first When it did limited resources both monetary and equipment required production controls as big as in the capitalist world

The Community of Christ is a Mormon movement From 1872 to 2001 it was known as Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints It was founded in the 1860s It did not recognise Brigham Young as a Prophet but instead followed Joseph Smith III the son of the founder of Mormonism Joseph Smith Unlike the followers of Young who went to Utah they remained were they were in the Midwestern United States mainly in Missouri A number of court cases established this Church as the follower of law of the church established by Smith for this reason it has the most manuscripts and the oldest Temple 

In general their beliefs are closer to mainline Protestant Christianity Unlike other Latter day Saints movemements they have a classic view of the Trinity They see the Book of Mormon as a valid source of learning but not as an additional revelation or scripture Their baptism is therefore recognised as a valid Christian one

Thule is the name of the island which Pytheas the ancient Greek explorer discovered in the fourth century BC Pytheas reported that this island was located in the north of Britain So it is believed that Thule is probably Iceland or the Shetland Islands or the Faroe Islands or the coasts of Norway Today a village in the north of Greenland is called Thule which is also called Qaanaaq

The November 2008 Mumbai attacks were twelve attacks of terror happening at the same time across Mumbai India from 26 November 2008 172 people were killed and 293 were injured 

A group called Deccan Mujahideen which was not known before has said it was responsible for the attacks It is possible that they are a part of the Indian Mujahideen

Around fifty to sixty terrorists took part in the attacks They looked young in their early twenties and wore T shirts black shirts and jeans The Guardian has said that they seemed cool and composed and in no hurry

Police officers who rescued hostages at the Chabad House were surprised that the terrorists looked white and either non Indian or from the countrys far north The terrorists had planned the attack several months before They set up control rooms in the two luxury hotels that were targeted

A previously unknown group the Deccan Mujahideen claimed responsibility They sent emails to news organizations The New York Times has stated that international security experts drew a blank on the Deccan Mujahideen group with one analyst labeling it a front name In September the Indian Mujahideen had warned of future attacks Their message said that you are already on our hit list and this time very very seriously

According to a witness the gunmen were looking for American and British passport holders and left others alone such as a man claiming to be Italian At the same time The Independent has reported that the attackers were young South Asian men speaking Hindi or Urdu suggesting they are probably members of an Indian militant group rather than foreigners

The Deccan Mujahiddeen is believed to be a terrorist group They do attacks inside India They came to the attention of the public after they said they were responsible for the attacks on Mumbai on 26 November 2008 It is possible that the organization could be related to the Indian Mujahideen

Deccan refers to the Deccan Plateau in southern India The states of Andhra Pradesh Karnataka Kerala and Tamil Nadu lie on this plateau The name is an anglicised from the Prakrit word dakkhin That word comes from the Sanskrit word dakia meaning South or The South

Mujahideen in Arabic is a struggler So the name Deccan Muhahideen may literally mean Strugglers of the South The South Strugglers or South Strugglers

In grammar case shows the role of a noun adjective or pronoun in a sentence It is a set of forms which depend on the syntax Case is an example of inflection which is an affix that signals a grammatical relationship Once it was part of Old English but modern English does not use it muchp197

In the Romance languages which are all derived from Latin nouns pack several ideas into one word These ideas are

So in many languages like Latin German Russian Spanish and Japanese a nouns case is shown by the end of the word Nouns change their endings to show if they are doing an action if they are having an action done to them if they just happen to be there during the action and whether they own something Therefore the word order is less important in these languages whereas in English it is vital 

In English we have only the remnants of this complicated system We use word order and add auxiliary words as needed 

English does have these cases for nouns and pronouns common case and genitivep202 Each may take a plural Examples

In English adjectives are unchanged red hat red hats

The Axon is the part of a neuron that sends the signal Axons are long thin and tendril like

Axons are much like a highly developed dendrite

The axon carries an electrical signal from the cell body to the synapse There the signal passes to other neurons or to muscle fibers The axon may be over a meter long in humans and even longer in bigger animals like elephants and whales 

The electrical signal of an axon is made by ions that flow in and out of the cell in a chain reaction called an action potential The speed at which the signal travels depends on how thick the axon is and how much insulation it has Insulation is provided by specialized cells called myelin that wrap around the axon

The Haasts Eagle was the largest eagle ever to have lived and is the only eagle in the world ever to have been top predator of its ecosystem It lived on the South Island of New Zealand

Fossil evidence shows that the areas where the Haasts Eagle lived were covered in forest and shrublands as well as in the grasslands on river floodplains 

The arrival of people in New Zealand had unfortunate consequences for the eagle by 1400 AD most of the forest habitat it used had been cleared by fire and most of the large flightless birds that it ate had been hunted to extinction

Benjamin Whiso Lee or Ben Lee was a Korean American theoretical physicist His work in theorical particle physics was very important to the development of the standard model in the late 20th century His work mainly affected the renormalization and the charm quark

Benjamin W Lee was born in Seoul Korea Before finishing high school he entered the department of Chemical Engineering at Seoul National University He was one of the best students During his time in college he transferred to the United States He graduated from Miami University Lee received a master degree from the University of Pittsburgh and his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania at the age of 25 Lee worked at Institute for Advanced Study He was a professor of physics at University of Pennsylvania SUNY at Stony Brook University of Chicago and head of the theoretical physics department at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory On June 16 1977 he was killed in a car accident near Kewanee Illinois Lee studied symmetry principles and weak interactions

In honor of his work in the field of electricity Napoleon made him a count in 1810 A museum in Como the Voltian Temple has been built in his honor and exhibits some of the original equipment he used to conduct experiments In 1881 an important electrical unit the volt was named in his honor There have also been innovations and discoveries named after Alessandro Volta including the Toyota Alessandro Volta and the Volta Crater on the Moon

Volta married the daughter of Count Ludovico Peregrini Teresa with whom he raised three sons In 1779 he became professor of experimental physics at the University of Pavia a chair he occupied for almost 25 years Volta is buried in the city of Como At the Tempio Voltiano near Lake Como there is a museum devoted to explaining his work

Friedrich August Kekule von Stradonitz was a German organic chemist Kekul was born in Darmstadt the son of a civil servant After graduating from secondary school in 1847 he entered the University of Giessen with the intention of studying architecture After hearing the lectures of Justus von Liebig he decided to study chemistry Following his education in Giessen he took postdoctoral fellowships in Paris in Chur Switzerland and in London where he was decisively influenced by Alexander Williamson

In 1858 he was hired as full professor at the University of Ghent then in 1867 was called to Bonn He studied carbon compounds especially studied benzene and he suggested benzene ring structure 

Kekuls most famous work was on the structure of benzene In 1865 Kekul published a paper in French suggesting that the structure contained a six membered ring of carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds The next year he published a much longer paper in German on the same subject The empirical formula for benzene had been long known but its highly unsaturated structure was challenging to determine Archibald Scott Couper in 1858 and Joseph Loschmidt in 1861 suggested possible structures that contained multiple double bonds or multiple rings but the study of aromatic compounds was in its earliest years and too little evidence was then available to help chemists decide on any particular structure

Ultra High Frequency is a electromagnetic radiation Especially its frequency is between 300 MHz and 3 GHz Because of short wavelenth UHF has strong directivity and it has small area UHF is commonly used for television signals It is strong enough to be protected from other signal but because of its strong directivity receiving error by an obstacle occurs more Hence it needs sensitive sensors

UHF frequencies have higher attenuation from atmospheric moisture and benefit less from bounce or the reflection of signals off the ionosphere back to earth when compared to VHF frequencies The frequencies of 3003000 MHz are always at least an order of magnitude above the MUF The MUF for most of the earth is generally between 2535 MHz Higher frequencies also benefit less from ground mode transmission However the short wavelengths of UHF frequencies allow compact receiving antennas with narrow elements many people consider them less ugly than VHF receiving models 

On December 29 1949 KC2XAK of Bridgeport Connecticut became the first UHF television station to operate on a regular daily schedule 

In the United States UHF stations originally gained a reputation for being more locally owned less polished less professional less popular and for having a weaker signal than their VHF counterparts The movie UHF starring Weird Al Yankovic parodied this phenomenon

However with the emergence of additional broadcast television networks the concentration of media ownershipConcentration of media ownership is a commonly used terms among media critics policy makers and others to characterize ownership structure of media industries Media ownership is said to be concentrated usually in one or more of the following ways and the proliferation of cable televisionCable television or Community Antenna Television CATV is a system of providing television FM radio programming and other services to consumers through fixed coaxial cables rather than by the older and more widespread rad digital televisionDigital television DTV uses digital modulation and compression to broadcast video audio and data signals to television sets

Introduction A major use of DTV can be to carry more channels on the same amount of bandwidth Another can be high definition pro and DSSDigital Satellite System DSS or Direct Broadcast Satellite DBS is a technology to deliver a television or audio signal digitally directly from a orbiting satellite to a consumers one to three foot diameter dish at the consumers home or business in the 1990sCenturies 19th century 20th century 21st century Decades 1940s 1950s 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s 2010s 2020s 2030s 2040s Years Events and trends Computers technology Explosive growth of the Internet decrease in the cost of computers and other techn the distinction between UHF and VHF stations has virtually disappeared in the United States Most HDTV stations broadcast their over the air signal in the UHF band 

In Britain UHF television began with the launch of BBC2 in 1964 using a 625 line system BBC1 and ITV soon added their own 625 line services on UHF and PAL colour was introduced on UHF only in 1967 1969 VHF was phased out by 1986 Today all British terrestrial television channels are on UHF A drawback to this is the very large number of small relay transmitters needed to fill in gaps in the main transmitters coverage which would not have been necessary with a VHF system due to its different propagation characteristics 

LC circuit is an electronic circuit made up of an inductor and a capacitor

Resultingly the parallel connected circuit will act as band stop filter having infinite impedance at the resonant frequency of the LC circuit

ASIC or Application specific integrated circuit is a kind of integrated circuit It is built for a particular use instead of for general purpose use Digital circuits are a common form of ASIC but analog circuits were manufactured beginning in the latter half of the 1990s

ASIC has advantages compared to Programmable Logic Device or Standard Logic IC First ASIC has a miniaturized embodiment size Second ASIC can improve speed Third ASIC needs less electric power to operate There are also disadvantages of ASIC First the cost per a unit can be expensive when producing a small number of units because of the expensive cost in producing a mask Second they can be hard to design and it is expensive and wastes time if they need to be redesigned Third the time of a manufacturing process can be long 

Design of ASIC is gate array design cell base design embedded array design standard cell design and structured ASIC design

With prepared foundation which has elementary gate circuit at first base manufacture the products with putting ordered proper wire layers Its manufacturing due is short because a finished product needs only production of wire layers and it is cheap because mass produce its foundation However because form a circuit with formation of standard gate it has worse contact rate and efficiency

wire layer is made between block that was designed and arranged and logical circuit and product is manufactured performance is better than gate array but time of making cell base is longer than time of making gate array and cost of making cell base is more expensive than cost of making gate array

Instead of part of gate array base finished functional block were located It was rest of theory for wired to use part of gate array It was called that gate array and basis of cell were compro mising

standard cell is a general term for gate array cell base embedded array if standard cell is cell base IC direction is different each company

For reduce time of development a wide use block which are similar with input and output interface and SRAM and PPL was arranged on Basis of gate array in advance Because It was able to correspond with minimum of individual plan We could see that Company of Distributed circuit which had wired to use exclusive wire layer Tried to reduce plan of consumer Its very different to Each of company offerd function

Designers of ASIC use a hardware description language such as Verilog or VHDL to describe the functionality of ASIC

In electrical engineering and computer science Image processing is any form of processing for which the input is an image such as photographs or frames of video The output of image processing can be either an image or a set of characteristics or parameters related to the image

It also means Analyzing and manipulating images with a computer Image processing is performed this three steps 

First import images with an optical devices like a scanner or a camera or directly through digital processing

Second manipulate or analyze the images in some way This step can include image improvement and data summary or the images are analyzed to find rules that arent seen by the human eyes For example meteorologists use this processing to analyze satellite photographs

Last output the result of image processing The result might be the image changed by some way or it might be a report based on analysis or result of the images

Image processing usually means digital image processing but optical and analog image processing are also included in image processing

White supremacy is the belief that white people are better than other races The words white supremacy are sometimes used to describe a political idea that shows the social and political dominance of whites

It is associated with racism White supremacists also want racial separation which means people of different races living apart White supremacy has often resulted in anti black racism and antisemitismFactdateNovember 2008

Different kinds of white supremacy have different ideas of whiteness and not all white supremacist groups agree on which group is their greatest enemy White supremacists frequently consider Jews to be the biggest threat to their cause because Jews are thought to be able to mix much more easily than other ethnic groups

Politically socially and economically white supremacy was common in the United States before the American Civil War and for decades after The same is true of apartheid in South Africa and of parts of Europe at different time periods importantly under Nazi Germanys Third Reich The amount and nature of white supremacys influence in western culture is a subject of ongoing debate In some parts of the United States many people who were considered non white could not vote and were barred from government office and prevented from holding most government jobs well into the second half of the twentieth century White leaders often viewed Native Americans and Australian Aborigines as obstacles to progress rather than as settlers in their own right Many European settled countries at the Pacific Ocean limited immigration from the Asian Pacific countries Many US states banned marriage between races through anti miscegenation laws until 1967 when these laws were changed South Africa maintained its white supremacist like Apartheid system until the early 1990s

White supremacists have become linked with a racist part of the skinhead subculture despite the fact that when the skinhead scene first developed in the United Kingdom in the late 1960s it was heavily influenced by Jamaican rude boys and British mods By the 1980s a large white power skinhead faction had formedFactdateDecember 2007

White supremacist groups can be found in most countries and regions with a large white population including North America Europe Australia New Zealand South Africa and Latin America In all of these locations their views represent a small amount of the population and active membership of the groups is quite small However a backlash to the non white immigrants into various European nations has caused a rise in membership in such organizationswhen as well as an increase in militant white supremacist demonstrations The militant approach taken by white supremacist groups has caused them to be watched closely by law enforcement officials Some European countries have laws stopping hate speech as well as other laws that ban or restrict some white supremacist organizations but not all

The Christian Identity movement which is regarded by other branches of Christianity as heretical is closely tied to white supremacyFactdateNovember 2008 Although the Ku Klux Klans reasons for supporting racial segregation are not primarily based on religious ideals some Klan groups are openly Christian Protestant because of their northern EuropeanGermanic roots Some white supremacists identify themselves as Odinists although most Odinists reject white supremacy and white supremacists make up only a small fraction of those who support Odinism Some white supremacist groups such as the South African Boeremag conflate elements of Christianity and Odinism

The World Church of the Creator now called the Creativity Movement promotes a federally recognized racial religious creed called Creativity The basic ideology is based on the idea of a sound mind in a sound body in a sound society in a sound environment The religion is dedicated to the survival expansion and advancement of the white race and building a whiter and brighter world Central to this is a unique holy war referred to as RAHOWA is which members of the white race must take steps to preserve their white race They believe that all races are at enmity with each other for territory and natural resources and their war is a religious war They are not Christian and essentially atheistic agnostic

Vulcan was a theoretical planet In the 19th century the planet was thought to orbit close to the sun Its gravitational pull would explain changes seen between the perihelion advance of Mercury from that predicted by Classical Mechanics The theory that Vulcan exists come from the earlier prediction that an outer planet was causing similar changes in the orbit of Uranus from the orbit predicted by classical theory

None of the searches for Vulcan found a planet This caused some people to not agree with Newtonian theory It lead to the development of Special Relativity and General Relativity Albert Einsteins modified theory of gravity showed why the orbit of Mercury changes without the existence of Vulcan This disproved the theories of Vulcan

The flag of Greece is rectangular with nine equal stripes of blue and white from left to right In the top left corner is a blue square with a white cross This flag has been used since 1822 when the young Greek state was fighting for its independence from the Ottoman Empire during the Greek War of Independence

The current flag of Greece was officially adopted during the First national assembly of the Greeks at Epidaurus in 1822 and the flag with the 9 stripes was adopted as a state and military ensign Another flag was chosen as a land flag it was a simple white cross on a blue field A third flag was adopted for the merchant fleet but it was only used for 8 years In 1978 the ensign was chosen as the sole national flag and it is now used by everyone on land and sea as the flag of Greece

It is sometimes known in Greece as the blue white in Greek or

The Deccan Plateau is a large plateau in India which covers the majority of the southern part of the country It is located between three mountain ranges and extends over eight Indian states in particular the states of Andhra Pradesh Karnataka Kerala and Tamil Nadu lie on this plateau 

The plateau covers 422000 sq km 43 percent of Indias landmass

The uplands areas of higher land make up a triangle nested within the familiar downward pointing triangle of the Indian sub continents coastline In the south of India the plateau is mostly over 1000 metres above sea level In the north it is mostly about 500 m above sea level  The plateau is very big and there are many habitats different Ecosystems with different sorts of vegetation climate geology and animals The forests on the plateau are older than the Himalayan mountains

On the west of the plateau are the Western Ghats and in the east are the Eastern Ghats These mountain ranges rise from their respective nearby coastal plains and nearly meet at the southern tip of India The mountains make the southward pointing vertex of a triangle The northern boundary of the triangle is made up by the Satpura Range and Vindhya Range These northern ranges separate the plateau from the heavily populated riverine plains of northern India

The Deccan Traps are a main cause of the special geography and geology of South India They are a large igneous province located on the Deccan Plateau of west central India and one of the largest volcanic features on Earth They consist of multiple layers of solidified flood basalt that together are more than convert2000m0abbron thick and cover an area of 500000 km2 The term trap used in geology for such rock formations is derived from the Dutch word for stairs referring to the step like hills forming the landscape of the region

The Deccan Traps formed between 60 and 68 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period The bulk of the volcanic eruption occurred at the Western Ghats some 66 million years ago This series of eruptions may have lasted fewer than 30000 years in total The gases released in the process may have played a role in the CretaceousTertiary extinction event which included the extinction of the non avian dinosaurs The consensus among the scientific community is that the extinction was triggered by the Chicxulub impact event in Central America but that the Deccan eruptions also damaged the worlds environment

Before the Deccan Traps region was reduced to its current size by erosion and plate tectonics it is estimated that the original area covered by the lava flows was as large as 15 million km approximately half the size of modern India The present area of directly observable lava flows is estimated to be around 512000km2

The release of volcanic gases particularly sulfur dioxide during the formation of the traps contributed to contemporary climate change Data point to an average fall in temperature of 2C in this period

Their modern centre of endemism is western South Africa and Namibia although a relict population and Eocene fossils suggest a wider ancient distribution

Members of the order are wingless even as adults making them relatively difficult to identify They resemble a mix between praying mantids and phasmids Molecular evidence indicates that they are most closely related to a family known as the Grylloblattidae

The mantophasmids were originally described from old museum specimens that found in Namibia and Tanzania and from a 45 million year old specimen of Baltic amber

The most recent classification recognizes numerous genera including fossils
