A peptic ulcer is an ulcer of the stomach or duodenum The duodenum is the first part of the small intestines It is the tube that food goes through when it leaves the stomach Peptic means talking about the stomach

Gastric ulcers are peptic ulcers in the stomach

Duodenal ulcers are peptic ulcers in the duodenum

Most ulcers are caused by an infection from bacteria This bacteria is called Helicobacter pylori 90 of gastric ulcers and 75 of duodenal ulcers are from Helicobacter pylori infection

Other things can make ulcers worse But these things are less important than Helicobacter pylori These other things are

A symptom is a change in the body that tells someone that they have a disease The biggest symptom is pain in the stomach Pain is usually in the top of the abdomen below the ribs Some people also feel pain go up to the chest

Other symptoms are

Diagnosing is how doctors see if someone has a disease They do this by running tests Peptic ulcers are diagnosed by three ways

The best way is endoscopy But this costs more money Endoscopy is done by a medical specialist called a gastroenterologist

A good thing about endoscopy is finding other diseases if there is no peptic ulcer The symptoms of peptic ulcer can be from other diseases Endoscopy can diagnose these other diseases

The most important treatment is to stop the Helicobacter pylori infection This is usually done with antibiotics and can now also be done through the use of natural products 

Antibiotics are medicines that kill germs like bacteria Usually three different antibiotics are used and because the Helicobacter pylori bacteria is so resistant successful treatment is not guaranteed The number of people turning to natural remedies is increasing Natural remedies have none of the side effects common to antibiotic treatment

It is also important to make less acid in the stomach There are two types of medicines that Doctors normally prescribe to stop the acid These are called antacids

Both of these medicines make the cells in the stomach stop making acid There is a problem in unnaturally stopping the production of acid because acid is vital to ensure proper digestion of foods When a patient stops taking antacids the stomach naturally starts producing acid again and usually more than normal because the antacids had unnaturally stopped this process The result is that there is now too much acid the whole problem starts again It is considered better and safer to control acid levels by consuming water and by eliminating foods that may cause excessive acid 

To stop peptic ulcers people must use antacids and antibiotics or a natural product The strategy is to kill off the Helicobacter pylori Controlling the acid levels let the open ulcers in the stomach lining heal quicker

Once the Helicobacter pylori infection is removed the ulcer should heal It can come back if the person is reinfected with Helicobacter pylori again

Symptoms are changes in the human body Symptoms are ways that people feel or ways that their bodies appear These are things that show if a person has a disease 

A medical diagnosis is when a doctor finds out what is making someone sick Sometimes doctors can diagnose a sickness by asking the person questions and looking at the persons body Sometimes doctors do tests Tests can mean taking a small bit of blood urine or tissue which is sent to a hospital laboratory where it is tested X rays are another form of test Tests are ways to see how the body is working

When a diagnosis has been made the doctor may recommend treatment

The True Jesus Church is a Christian church It was started during the early 20th century It is an independent Church It split from the Pentecostal movement in China The pentecostal movement is an evangelical movement within Christianity This group practices faith healing speaking in tongues baptism by immersion feet washing and the Saturday Sabbath By 1949 they claimed 120000 members meeting in 700 churches Although banned in the Peoples Republic of China in 1958 along with all the other Christian churches they were permitted to reopen in 1985 and since then they have experienced rapid growth and have spread nationwide although they are strongest in Jiangsu Hunan and Fujian provinces They strongly emphasis daily prayer both private and public and engage in vigorous evangelism 

Currently their churches are found in forty eight countries and six continents Followers of the Church believe that God has only a divine nature so they therefore reject the idea of the Trinity

Christian holidays were often near the dates of pagan ones This is also true for Easter Christmas and Good Friday The feast of Sol invictus was on the 25th of December It was a very important holiday in Ancient Rome Because of the pagan origins of the holidays the True Jesus Church does not celebrate Easter and Christmas The movement has between 15 and 25 million followers

Pokmon is a Japanese video game franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri for Nintendo in the 1990s It is known as Pocket Monsters in Japan It is now made up of animated television programs Japanese comic books trading cards and toys but most importantly the video games There are currently 493 monsters Pikachu is the most well known When the idea was invented there were only 150 which was upgraded to 151 when the Blue version in Japan was released In the United States and Europe the number of Pokmon was 151 from the beginning There are now over 400 altogether

The Pokmon games involve making decisions about what to do and when to do it They allow the player to catch the monsters train them to make them better and attack other monsters so that they get better abilities and possibly evolve into different Pokmon It is also possible to trade Pokmon with a friend The Pokmon in the battles never bleed or die they only faint All Pokmon love human beings except for Shadow Pokmon  the doors to their hearts have been artificially closed The games slogan in the US was Gotta catch em all although now it is not used officially any more The Japanese slogan is Lets get Pokmon Over one hundred million of the games have been sold so far not counting the ones released for the Nintendo 64 and the Nintendo GameCube This makes it the second best selling video game series of all time

Seven versions of the animated television series exist from 1998 until now on Kids WB and Cartoon Network Additionally nine full length movies have been made since 1999

The first games released in 1998 were Pokmon Red and Blue which unexpectedly became big hits and are still among the best selling video games of all time They followed the adventures of the player a Pokmon trainer who catches raises and battles with Pokmon collects badges from the 8 Gym Leaders explores all over Kanto and trades Pokmon with other people who have the game by using the Game Boys Game Link Cable Later a sequel to Red and Blue was released Pokmon Yellow In this game the players character design is similar to Ash Ketchum Also instead of the Pokmon given to the player at the start of Red and Blue in Yellow the only possible choice is Pikachu which represents the Pokmon Ash started with in the anime

When Nintendo realized how popular Red Blue and Yellow had become they decided to support the production and release of more games After Yellow came Pokmon Gold and Silver released in 2000 which had a total of 251 catchable Pokmon as opposed to only 151 previously A sequel to the two games was released Pokmon Crystal which had several new features that were not on Gold and Silver Pokmon had animated sprites when they came into battle there was a subplot within the games relating to the different letter shapes of the Pokmon Unown and there was a new building called the Battle Tower where players could battle very strong Pokmon to win items and set records Once the player has beaten the Elite Four they can go to Kanto the region in Red Blue and Yellow

In 2003 Pokmon Ruby and Sapphire were released They were the first Pokmon games on the Game Boy Advance and this upset many players because they could not trade Pokmon with Red Blue Yellow Gold Silver or Crystal However there were 135 new Pokmon bringing the total to 386 There were many new features like a PokNav many more kinds of Pok Balls a far bigger region than in previous games and a Battle Tower different from the one in Crystal Players could also create Secret Bases small hideouts hidden in trees and rock walls

Later in 2004 Pokmon FireRed and LeafGreen were released They did not take place in a new region and they did not have any new Pokmon They were simply remakes of Pokmon Red and Blue adding a new extra region called the Sevii Islands and a few new features However they made it possible for players of Ruby and Sapphire to get earlier Pokmon in their games If a person had Ruby Sapphire Colosseum FireRed and LeafGreen they could have all 386 Pokmon which made many players happy

In 2005 Pokmon Emerald was released It was a sequel to Ruby and Sapphire It was the first main Pokmon game since Crystal where Pokmon had battle animations instead of static images There was also a new place called the Battle Frontier where players could go after they beat the Elite Four It was similar to the Battle Tower in Crystal Ruby and Sapphire except it was eight different facilities all with different rules Players earned Battle Points which could be used to buy items for Secret Bases items for Pokmon and other things

In 2007 Pokmon Diamond and Pearl were released They took place in a new region called Sinnoh They had 107 new Pokmon which brought the total to 493 Another noticeable difference from the previous games was that Diamond and Pearl did not capitalize all the letters in names of Pokmon people towns items and other things that were important to the games For example Lugia would appear as LUGIA in previous games but in Diamond and Pearl it would just say Lugia This cleared up a lot of players confusion because many thought that a sentence like LUGIA is found in the WHIRL ISLANDS looked unusual A sequel to Diamond and Pearl Pokmon Platinum has been released in Japan then it was released in the United States in March 2009 In May 2009 it was released in the UK

In 2010 Pokmon HeartGold and SoulSilver were released They did not take place in a new region or have any new Pokmon They were simply remakes of Pokmon Gold and Silver Like Pokmon Yellow the players Pokmon can follow them The games come with a pedometer like device called the Pok Walker that can let players walk with their Pokmon and gain Watts which can be used to fight Pokmon or dowse for items

Homer Simpson is a cartoon character in the animated television series The Simpsons He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta He first appeared along with the other members of the Simpson family on The Tracey Ullman Show in the Simpson Short Good Night

He is the father of Bart Simpson Lisa Simpson and Maggie Simpson he is also the husband of Marge Simpson He lives in the fictional town known as Springfield 

Homer is clumsy fat and very lazy He is also an alcoholic and is not very smart He works as a Safety Inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant Homer is one of the most popular and famous fictional characters and is thought of as one of the greatest comedic animated characters of modern times Although Homer seems selfish he does actually care for his family In one episode he entered Lisa in a beauty contest so she could feel better about herself He is often heard saying Doh which has become an often used word when things go wrong He likes to drink beer and is often seen hanging out at Moes Tavern with his best friends Carl Carlson Lenny Leonard and Barney Gumble

Matt Groening first drew the Simpson family in the lobby of James L Brooks office After he had decided not to do his Life in Hell cartoon series he quickly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family with Homer being named after his father Homers middle initial J which was discovered to stand for Jay was a tribute to Bullwinkle J Moose from Rocky and Bullwinkle a show Matt Groening loved as a child In a TV Guide poll Homer was named as the second greatest cartoon character behind Bugs Bunny

A five year study of more than 2500 middle aged people in France found a possible connection between weight and brain function named as the Homer Simpson syndrome Results from a word memory test showed that people with a BMI of 20 remembered an average of 9 out of 16 words Meanwhile people with a BMI of 30 remembered an average of 7 out of 16 words 

Calcium is a chemical element Its symbol on the periodic table is Ca Its atomic number is 20 It has 20 protons and 20 electrons The most common isotopes are Ca 40 and Ca 44 Its mass number is about 4008 Calcium is very important in the human body It is required for minerals and bones

Calcium is a soft white gray metal It is an alkaline earth metal It melts at a quite high temperature for a reactive metal It is a little harder than lead It has two allotropes It does not conduct electricity as well as copper but is much lighter in weight

It reacts with water to produce hydrogen and calcium hydroxide It reacts with water very fast when it is powdered When it is in a chunk it starts reacting slowly because calcium hydroxide makes a coating that does not dissolve on the calcium If a little acid is added to calcium hydroxide it dissolves it making the calcium react very fast It burns when powdered to make a reddish flame This makes calcium oxide It also makes calcium nitride when heated It can react with halogens to make calcium halides like calcium chloride with chlorine 

Calcium forms chemical compounds in the 2 oxidation state Calcium compounds are colorless Most calcium compounds are not toxic They are needed in the human body actually They are unreactive as far as calcium ions go Calcium oxide was used to make limelights which have a flame heating calcium oxide and makes it glow very bright

 FileCalcium hydroxidejpgCalcium hydroxide FileCalcium chloridejpgCalcium chloride FileCalcium sulfate hemihydratejpgCalcium sulfate hydrated FileDusinan vpenatJPGCalcium nitrate 

It is the 5th most common element on the earth

Calcium is not found as a metal in the ground it is too reactive Calcium carbonate also known as calcite is the most common calcium mineral 

Calcium ions is very important for all organisms To stay healthy it is important to eat calcium ions every day Without enough calcium ions bones can become weak This is called osteoporosis

Calcium metal is not used in the human body it will fizz and make toxic chemicals and flammable gases Calcium compounds are used like calcium carbonate or calcium phosphate

It is important to know how cells work Many cells have calcium channels on their surface These are openings where calcium ions can enter the cell The cell is told to act and it opens the channels Once in the cell calcium ions activates many proteins to do specific things For example when it goes into muscle cells it makes them contract When it goes into nerve cells it triggers electrical impulses that send a messages When it goes into white blood cells it makes them fight germs

Calcium ions are important to cells and too many calcium ions can be bad If a cell gets more calcium ion than it needs it can die This is why the amount of calcium ion in cells is highly regulated Conversely not enough calcium ion is bad Cells must have the right amount to function properly

Sometimes cells are unhealthy and need to die in for the body to replace them with new healthy cells This keeps the whole organism healthy Cells know when they should die and can trigger reactions to end their life cycles in many ways When this happens it is called apoptosis also known as a programmed cell death One way cells accomplish apoptosis by taking in toxic levels of calcium ions

Calcium is very important for the human body 

Bones contain most of the calcium ion in the human body If we need more calcium for our blood muscles or other tissue it comes from the bones If we have extra calcium it goes into bones

Calcium as an element is not found in the human body just calcium ions in the form of chemical compounds

Organisms need to keep calcium ion levels very well controlled High calcium levels are bad and low calcium levels are bad

The body controls this by changing

The control of calcium in the body is called calcium metabolism

The body controls calcium levels with many hormones Calcitonin Parathyroid hormone and Vitamin D are the most important hormones in calcium metabolism

Calcium metal is made by electrolysis of melted calcium chloride It has to be very hot to melt it The calcium metal is liquid

Calcium is used in the reduction of other metals It can also be used to make alloys with other metals 

Calcium compounds are also important in chemistry It is important for making things It is a part of cement which is needed to make concrete

Calcium is part of calcium oxide Calcium oxide is used to make paper pottery food and to purify water Calcium carbonate is used as a calcium supplement Calcium permanganate can be used as a rocket propellant

Calcium is toxic as an element It reacts with water and makes a strong base calcium hydroxide Calcium compounds are not toxic unless the anion is toxic Calcium permanganate is only toxic because of the permanganate not the calcium

In 2004 there was a movie version from Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon movies starring Jim Carrey as Count Olaf

A membrane is a thin soft layer of material A membrane separates two things 

In biology a membrane can be mean two things a tissue or plasma membrane Plasma membranes are very small Tissue membranes are bigger

A membrane can mean a thin layer of cells or tissue This layer covers separates or lines a tissue or organ An example is the mucous membrane that is the skin that lines the inside of your nose and mouth

The plasma membrane covers cells Plasma membranes also divide the cell into different spaces called organelles Organelles are special areas of the cell that do different work For example the nucleus holds the DNA in a cell The mitochondria make energy for the cell

Plasma membranes are made of lipids and protein The lipids keep the inside of the cell separate from the outside The proteins do many things They give the cell messages from outside They let some things go into and out of the cell 

Franois Marie Arouet was a French philosopher He was born in 1694 and died in 1778

Voltaire did not like France at the time because he thought that it was old fashioned He also did not like the church and thought that people should be allowed to believe what they want However he did not like democracy either and thought that a country needed to be lead by a wise and strong king Voltaire had to live in exile in England for three years from 1726 to 1729 where these ideas were more common He liked the philosophy of John Locke

Voltaire was also a writer He wrote many books poems and plays some of which are still liked today A lot of his work was against France and the Church This meant that he was unpopular at first but became more popular towards the time of the French Revolution When he died aged 83 Voltaire was a hero of French people He also studied science and wrote a lot about people and places he knew

Voltaire believed in God but did not believe in a god personally involved in peoples lives like the Christian god This is called Deism When he died in Paris Voltaire was not allowed to be buried in a church because he did not believe in the Christian god

Wimbledon is a suburb in the south west area of Greater London England The Wimbledon Championships a tennis competition is held there every summer Also in Wimbledon are New Wimbledon Theatre and Wimbledon Common one of the largest areas of common land in London Wimbledon FC a famous football club started in Wimbledon then moved to Milton Keynes and changed their name to Milton Keynes Dons FC People live in two different areas The High Street area is called the village and the area near the railway station is called the town The High Street area is part of the original Middle Ages village and the town area is modern  houses were first built there in 1838

People are known to have lived in Wimbledon since the Iron Age when the hill fort on Wimbledon Common was built At the time the Domesday Book was written Wimbledon belonged to the lord of the manor of Mortlake The ownership of the manor of Wimbledon changed between various wealthy families many times during its history and the area also attracted other wealthy families who built large houses such as Eagle House Wimbledon House and Warren House The people in the village were either poor people who worked on the land or they were rich and important people The rich and poor people lived together happily In the 18th century the Dog and Fox public house became a stop on the stagecoach run from London to Portsmouth then in 1838 the London and South Western Railway opened a station to the south east of the village at the bottom of Wimbledon hill After the station was built new houses were built near to it and many people began living near the station In the second half of the 19th century the amount of people living in Wimbledon grew quickly At the start of the 19th century there were about 1000 people living in Wimbledon then in 1911 there were about 55000 people During this time large numbers of villas and terraced houses were built out along the roads from the centre towards neighbouring Putney Merton Park and Raynes Park

Wimbledon lies in the south west area of London south of Wandsworth and east of Kingston upon Thames on the outskirts of Greater London It is convert7mikm1 south west of the centre of London at Charing Cross It is considered an rich suburb with a mix of grand Victorian houses modern housing and low rise apartments The residential area is split into two sections known as the village and the town with the village around the High Street being part of the original medieval village and now a prime residential area of London commanding high prices and the town being part of the modern development since the building of the railway station in 1838

The area is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London

The population consists around 57000 adults the majority in the ABC1 social group The population grew from around 1000 at the start of the 19th century to around 55000 in 1911 a figure which has remained reasonably stable since

Originally Wimbledon had its own borough of Wimbledon and was within the county of Surrey it was absorbed into the London Borough of Merton as part of the creation of Greater London in 1965 It is in the Parliamentary constituency of Wimbledon and since 2005 it has been represented by Conservative MP Stephen Hammond

Wimbledon Football Club was began in Wimbledon in 1889 In 2002 it moved to Milton Keynes and it 2004 it changed its name to Milton Keynes Dons FC Many football fans in Wimbledon did not agree with the move They decided to start a new club there which is called AFC Wimbledon

The club played in the English Football League and won the FA Cup in 1988 It was a professional football club which means that the players get paid to play

The Adventures of Pete and Pete was an American television show on the Nickelodeon network in the early 1990s It was about two brothers with the same first name who grow up together

A motorcycle is a form of transport to move people from one place to another It does not have 4 wheels like a car It has 2 wheels like a bicycle But it has a motor like a car A motorcycle is normally driven by one person One may also take another person with him on the back of the motorcycle There are also motorcycles with a sidecar then 3 people can be transported

In 1901 the first successful motorcycle was made by Indian motorcycles in Springfield Massachusetts Since then many other companies have made them There are different manufacturers of motorcycle like Honda Suzuki Yamaha A well known American manufacturer of motorcycles is Harley Davidson

Motorcycles are used both for transportation and extreme sports Since motorcycles can be lighter than cars they can accelerate more quickly But it also makes them not as safe as cars because they do not have a protecting chassis around them like cars Very often motorcycle riders are injured heavily in accidents A motorcycle rider can wear a helmet and clothing that has armor This special clothing may reduce the riders injuries in an accident

In the middle of the last century motorcycles were used by many as a cheap method of transportation Many people who did not have the money to buy a car could afford a small motorcycle Back then motorcycles were also much slower and with less motor power Today motorcycles are used more as a hobby Unlike cars motorcycles do not have a protection against wind and rain That makes it difficult to drive in winter or at bad weather

On road bikes must have a special type of drivers license to be ridden legally Off road bikes are not allowed to be driven on public roads

Speed and stunts are the main goals for off road bike sports Many on road bikes are much faster than off road bikes and can be used in sports such as motorbike racing

Guinea Pigs are small animals They are mammals and rodents Their scientific name is Cavia porcellus which is cavies Porcellus in the genitive That is Latin for little pig Guinea Pigs are not related to pigs and are not from Guinea They originated in the Andes studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggest they are domesticated descendants of a closely related species of cavy  For this reason they do not occur naturally in the wild

In many parts of the world people keep them as pets In Peru Bolivia and several other countries they are raised for food The first people who domesticated the animals did it for food Besides being a pet and a source of food in some places people think guinea pigs keep bad spirits away In Quechua the language of some the native tribes of Peru they are called quivi The Spanish speaking people of the region call them cuy

This perception of pigginess occurred in many languages other than English the German word for them is broken wikt linkMeerschweinchenMeerschweinchen literally Little Sea Pigs the Russian and Polish word for them is similar morskaya svinka and winka morska respectively meaning also Little Sea Pig The French word is broken wikt linkCochon dIndeCochon dInde the Dutch used to call it guinees biggetje and in Norway Sweden and Denmark they are called broken wikt linkmarsvinmarsvin In Greek they are called indika xoiridia and in Portuguese the term is porquinho da ndia literally little pig of the Indies In Italian the term is either Porcellino DIndia or Cavia Peruviana However this perception of pigginess is not universal to all languages or cultures For example the common Spanish word is conejillo de Indias

Guinea pigs need large open air cages in which to romp and frolic They should have a diet of 18 cup of high quality pellets like kmshayloft or oxbow They should also have unlimited grass hay and at least one cup of a variety of veggies Guinea pigs like to be held in hand Guinea pigs should be kept in cages larger than 75 square feet or 105 square feet for 2 pigs They should always have a friend as guinea pigs are social animals Breeding guinea pigs are not recommended as the rate of pregnancy complications are very high

Guinea pig is also slang for a person who is the first to try something It can also mean the subject of an experiment This is because guinea pigs are used by scientists to do biology experiments

Environment means all of the outside forces events and things that act on a thing A persons environment is made up of everything that surrounds him or her including houses buildings people animals land temperature water light and other living and non living things Living things do not simply exist in their environment They constantly interact with it Organisms change in response to conditions in their environment The environment consists of the interactions among plants animals soil water temperature light and other living and non living things

The word environment is used to talk about many things People in different fields of knowledge use the word differently

In psychology and medicine a persons environment is the people physical things places and events that the person lives with The environment affects the growth and development of the person It affects the persons behavior It affects the persons body and mind

In biology and ecology the environment is all of the natural materials and living things including sunlight This is also called the natural environment Some people call themselves environmentalists These people think that harmony with the environment is important They think we must protect the environment They think people should not put so much pollution into the environment The important things in the environment that we value are called natural resources For example fish sunlight and forests These are renewable natural resources because more grow naturally when we use them Non renewable natural resources are important things in the environment that do not come back naturally for example coal and natural gas

In literature and history environment is the events and culture that a person lived in A persons beliefs and actions are dependent on his environment For example Thomas Jefferson owned slaves Today we know this is very wrong But in Thomas Jeffersons environment slavery was normal So his actions did not look as wrong in his society

A tooth is one of the hard white things in your mouth Teeth are used to chew food Chew means to break up and crush food so it can be swallowed Some animals also use teeth as a weapon 

Children have 20 teeth The first teeth start to erupt when a baby is 5 10 months old When these teeth erupt it can hurt Babies chew on things to make the pain better This is called teething Most children have all 20 teeth by 2 or 3 years of age At age 6 7 the permanent teeth start to erupt By the age of 11 12 most children have 28 adult teeth The last 4 teeth called wisdom teeth or third molars come in by age 17 21 in most people Some people never grow wisdom teeth Or they may have only 2 instead of 4

The outside white part of teeth is called the enamel The enamel is made of calcium and phosphate Under the enamel is the dentin The dentin is softer than the hard enamel So it is hurt more by dental decay Under the dentin is the pulp which has the nerves and blood vessels that go to the tooth This is the part that causes the pain of a toothache Cementum is outside the dentin where there is no enamel Cementum holds the tooth to the bone of the jaw

If they are protected and kept clean teeth should stay for a persons whole life Many people lose their teeth early because they do not do the right things to keep teeth healthy 

Some things people can do to keep teeth healthy

Plaque is the soft white substance that forms on teeth when they are not cleaned It has bacteria in it that hurt enamel If plaque is not cleaned off after 2 days it can become tartar Tartar is a hard substance that forms on teeth Tartar makes gums unhealthy and makes more bacteria grow on the teeth

Plaque is cleaned off with a toothbrush If tartar forms on teeth a dentist must clean it off 

The bacteria that are on teeth eat into the enamel Cleaning teeth flossing teeth eating good foods and having a dentist take off plaque make less bacteria on teeth If there is too much bacteria they eat enamel faster than teeth make enamel This makes holes in enamel called cavities When a person gets cavities he has the disease dental caries Making cavities in enamel happens slowly But once cavities go through enamel the soft dentin is hurt much faster If the cavity is not fixed by a dentist it can go into the root This permanently hurts the tooth Once this happens the tooth must be taken out or the dentist must do a root canal If the tooth is not fixed with a root canal or is not taken out a tooth infection can happen This infection can spread onto the face It can even kill the person if not helped by a dentist or doctor

Yoghurt or yogurt is a dairy product made by bacterial fermentation of milk The lactose in the milk becomes lactic acid when it is fermented Lactic acid acts on the protein in the milk to make yoghurt thick and sour Yoghurt made from cows milk is called dairy yoghurt It is produced using a culture of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus bacteria The milk is heated to about 80C to kill any bad bacteria and to change the milk proteins so that they set together instead of becoming curds After it is cooled to about 45C the bacteria culture is added and the milk is kept at that temperature for 4 to 7 hours to ferment Soy yoghurt is made from soy milk

People have been making and eating yoghurt for at least 5400 years Today it is eaten all over the world A nutritious food which is especially good for your health it is rich in protein calcium riboflavin vitamin B6 and vitamin B12

The word yoghurt comes from yourt and is related to the words yourmak to knead and youn dense or thick The letter was used to be written as gh when people translated the Turkish language This is because it used to be written a variant of the Arabic alphabet until Latin alphabet started being used in 1928 so it was harder to translate at that time

In Bulgaria yogurt is called  which means sour milk in Serbia yogurt is also called  but Serbian yogurt is a thick milky liquid

In English there are many ways to spell the word In Australia and New Zealand yoghurt is the main spelling In the United Kingdom yoghurt and yogurt are both used but yoghurt is more common and yoghourt is also sometimes used In the United States yogurt is the usual spelling In Canada yogurt is most common among English speakers but many brands use yogourt because it is correct in both French and English

The word is usually said with a short o in the UK with a long o in North America Australia and South Africa and with either a long or short o in New Zealand and Ireland

The earliest yoghurts were probably made by wild bacteria and happened by chance

The oldest writings mentioning yogurt were by Pliny the Elder who said that some people knew how to thicken the milk into something which was sour but tasty The use of yoghurt by medieval Turks is recorded in the books Diwan Lughat al Turk by Mahmud Kashgari and Kutadgu Bilig by Yusuf Has Hajib written in the 11th century Both texts mention the word yoghurt in different sections and describe how it was used Francis I suffered from a serious diarrhoea which no French doctor could cure His ally Suleiman the Magnificent sent a doctor who cured the patient with yoghurt The grateful French king spread around the information about the food which had cured him

Until the 1900s yoghurt was eaten all the time by people in the Russian Empire Western Asia South Eastern EuropeBalkans Central Europe and India Stamen Grigorov a Bulgarian student of medicine in Geneva first examined the bacteria in Bulgarian yoghurt In 1905 he said that it contained a round and a rod like lactic acid bacteria In 1907 the rod like bacteria was called Lactobacillus bulgaricus The Russian Nobel laureate biologist Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov from the Institut Pasteur in Paris was influenced by Grigorovs work and made a hypothesis that eating yoghurt regularly was the reason why Bulgarian peasants lived for so long Mechnikov believed that Lactobacillus was needed for good health and worked to make yoghurt popular through Europe

In 1919 a Sephardic Jewish entrepreneur named Isaac Carasso started a small yoghurt business in Barcelona and named the business Danone after his son The business later expanded to the United States where it was called Dannon

Yoghurt with fruit jam added to it was patented in 1933 by the Radlick Mlkrna dairy in Prague It was introduced to the United States in 1947 by Dannon

Yoghurt was first brought to the United States by Armenian immigrants Sarkis and Rose Colombosian who started Colombo and Sons Creamery in Andover Massachusetts in 1929 Colombo Yogurt was first sent around New England in a horse drawn wagon with the Armenian word madzoon written on it This was later changed to yogurt the Turkish name of the product In the 1950s and 60s yoghurt became very popular in the United States because it was sold as a health food By the late 20th century yoghurt had become a common food in America and Colombo Yogurt was sold in 1993 to General Mills who stopped using the brand name in 2010

Yoghurt has a lot of protein calcium riboflavin vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 in it It is better for you than milk is Many people who are lactose intolerant can enjoy yoghurt because much of the lactose in the milk has become lactic acid

Yoghurt also has medical uses and in preventing antibiotic associated diarrhea 

Yoghurt is believed to promote good gum health possibly because the lactic acids in yoghurt encourage good bacteria

A study in the International Journal of Obesity found that eating low fat yoghurt can help weight loss In the study obese people who ate 3 servings of low fat yoghurt a day lost 22 more weight than the control group who only cut back on calories and did not have extra calcium They also lost 81 more abdominal fat

Galician is a language that is spoken in Galicia just north of Portugal It is very similar to Portuguese Some even say it is the same language but with a different accent Galician is very close to Leonese language

Galician is a Romance language that started on the west part of the Roman Empire called Gallaecia Today this same place is the north of Portugal and Galicia itself

Galician took words from many languages like Latin Germanic Spanish and Celtic

The Galician of today comes from the Galician Portuguese language spoken during the Middle Ages

Today Galician is spoken only in Galicia and by some people in South America and Western Europe

Some people say Galician and Portuguese are the same language because there are not a lot differences between them but they are officially two separate languages

People that speak Portuguese and people who speak Galician can understand each other very well

The Swabian Alb is a plateau in Baden Wrttemberg Germany The Swabian Alb is situated between the Black Forest Stuttgart Bavaria and the Lake Constance A lot of fossils are found here The highest mountain is the Lemberg

A nerve is a group of special nerve cells grouped together in parallel Another word for nerve cell is neuron The special neurons grouped together in nerves take information to and from the body to the central nervous system The central nervous system CNS is the brain and spinal cord The spinal cord is the big cord that goes from the brain into the back It carries all the information that goes from the brain to the nerves in the body

All the nerves in the body make the peripheral nervous system The brain and spinal cord are the CNS All the nerves that come from the spinal cord are the PNS Together the CNS and PNS are the nervous system

Nervand cells called glia Glia are not neurons but they are very important They keep the neurons safe and healthyneurons take messages to and from the CNS to the rest The dendrite and axon are fibers that go out from the cell body Axons take information away from the cell body Dendrites take information to the cell body

Afferent nerves take messages to the CNS from the body They take messages about sensation from the skin They take messages about the position of the body from the muscles They take messages about the function of organs like the heart and stomach

Efferent nerves take messages from the CNS to the body They take messages that tell muscles to move They take messages to glands They tell glands like sweat glands to make sweat

There are many diseases of nerves A disease of nerves is also called a neuropathy

A vaccine is a medication usually of biological origin which improves immunity to a particular disease The term derives from the Latin vaccn us in 1796 Edward Jenner used cows infected with cowpox to protect people against smallpox

In the 19th century Louis Pasteur developed a rabies vaccine In the 20th century vaccines were introduced against diphtheria measles mumps and rubella In 1950s the polio vaccine was developed However vaccines still do not exist for many important diseases including malaria and HIVCompulsory vaccination laws were passed 

A vaccine often contains something like a germ that has been weakened or killed or the germs toxins Some vaccines are synthetic vaccines that are made in a laboratory

There are many types of vaccines currently in use 

Vaccines can be prophylactic or therapeutic The agent in the vaccine stimulates the bodys immune system to recognize the agent as foreign destroy it and remember it Then the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of the microorganisms that it later encounters When the virulent version of an agent comes along the body recognizes the protein coat on the virus and thus is prepared to respond by neutralizing the target agent before it can enter cells and by recognizing and destroying infected cells before that agent can multiply to vast numbers

Effectiveness of vaccines Vaccines do not guarantee complete protection from a disease Sometimes this is because the hosts immune system simply does not respond adequately or at all This may be due to a lowered immunity in general or because the hosts immune system does not have a B cell capable of generating antibodies to that antigen Even if the host develops antibodies the immune system might still not be able to defeat the infection

The efficacy is dependent on a number of factors

Adjuvants usually boost immune response They include aluminium adjuvants squalene squalene and phosphate adjuvants

Opposition to using vaccines has existed since the earliest time Although the benefits of using vaccines in preventing suffering and death from infectious diseases greatly outweigh the risks of rare adverse effects following administration of vaccines disputes have arisen over the morality ethics effectiveness safety of using vaccines or that vaccine safety studies are inadequate Some religious groups do not allow uses of vaccines and some political groups oppose mandatory vaccination on the grounds of individual liberty In response a study says Vaccine refusal not only increases the individual risk of disease but also increases the risk for the whole community 

Principle 18 of the Yogyakarta Principles also affirm the protection from unethical or involuntary treatments including vaccines

One challenge in vaccine development is economic The diseases most demanding a vaccine HIV malaria and tuberculosis exist principally in poor countries Pharmaceutical firms and biotechnology companies have little incentive to develop vaccines for these diseases because there is little revenue potential the financial and other risks are great

Most vaccine development to date has relied on governments universities and non profit organizations Many vaccines have been highly cost effective and beneficial for public health The number of vaccines actually administered has risen dramatically in recent decades This increase particularly in the number of different vaccines administered to children before entry into schools may be due to government mandates and support rather than economic incentive

The filing of patents on vaccine development processes can be viewed as an obstacle to the development of new vaccines Because of the weak protection offered through a patent on the final product the protection of the innovation regarding vaccines is often made through the patent of processes used on the development of new vaccines as well as the protection of secrecy

Vaccine production techniques are evolving Cultured mammalian cells are expected to become increasingly important compared to conventional options such as chicken eggs due to greater productivitity and few problems with contamination Recombination technology that produces genetically detoxified vaccine is expected to grow in popularity for the production of bacterial vaccines that use toxoids Combination vaccines are expected to reduce the quantities of antigens they contain and thereby decrease undesirable interactions by using pathogen associated molecular patterns

In vaccine preparations beside the active vaccine itself the following components are commonly present 

Preservatives in vaccines such as thiomersal phenoxyethanol and formaldehyde prevent serious adverse effects Thiomersal is more effective against bacteria has better shelf life and improves vaccine stability potency and safety but in the US the European Union and a few other rich countries it is no longer used as a preservative in childhood vaccines as a precautionary measure due to its mercury content Although controversial claims have been made that thiomersal contributes to autism no convincing scientific evidence supports these claims Absence of any preservative in vaccine may result in adverse effects such as Staphylococcus infection that in one 1928 incident killed 12 of 21 children inoculated with a diphtheria vaccine that lacked a preservative

Delivery systems There are several new delivery systems in development which will hopefully make vaccines more efficient to deliver Possible methods include liposomes and ISCOM New delivery technologies have resulted in oral vaccines as a polio vaccine With an oral vaccine there is no risk of blood contamination Solid oral vaccines have proven to be more stable and less likely to freeze this stability reduces the need for a cold chain the resources required to keep vaccines within a restricted temperature range from the manufacturing stage to the point of administration which in turn will decrease costs of vaccines Finally a micro needle approach seems to be the vaccine of the future The microneedle which is pointed projections fabricated into arrays that can create vaccine delivery pathways through the skin

Vaccinations of animals are used both to prevent their contracting diseases and to prevent transmission of disease to humans Both animals kept as pets and animals raised as livestock are routinely vaccinated In some instances wild populations may be vaccinated This is sometimes accomplished with vaccine laced food spread in a disease prone area and has been used to attempt to control rabies in raccoons Where rabies occurs rabies vaccination of dogs may be required by law Other canine vaccines include canine distemper canine parvovirus infectious canine hepatitis adenovirus 2 leptospirosis bordatella canine parainfluenza virus and Lyme disease among others

Principles that govern the immune response can now be used in tailor made vaccines against many noninfectious human diseases such as cancers and autoimmune disorders For example the experimental vaccine CYT006 AngQb has been investigated as a possible treatment for high blood pressure 

Injury means a harm or hurt

Usually an injury is when the body or a part of the body damaged by something outside of the body Another word for injury to a body is trauma

Injury can be by

Injury can be accidental or intentional Intentional injury is when someone tries to hurt another person Accidental injury is when no one means to hurt someone else An example of accidental injury is a car wreck

Mercedes Benz is a brand of cars and trucks from the Daimler AG company of Germany The company was once known as Daimler Benz and is still sometimes called just Mercedes Mercedes Benz is the worlds oldest car maker and the cars they make cost a lot of money The symbol of Mercedes Benz is very famous It is a three pointed star inside of a circle and was designed by one of the men who started the company Gottlieb Daimler The three points of the star stand for land air and sea because Daimlers engines were used not only in cars and trucks but in airplanes and boats The symbol was first used in 1909 

Mercedes Benz cars are an important part of the history of the car with many firsts They were the first to build a diesel powered car in the 1930s the first to build a car with fuel injection in the 1950s and the first to offer antilock brakes in the 1970s Mercedes Benz cars have also been important in auto racing history

A record label or record company makes and sells audio and video recordings on various formats including compact discs LPs DVD Audio SACDs and cassettes The name record label is from the paper label at the center of a gramophone record 

Most major record labels are owned by a few large multinational companies that make up the almost all of the global recording industry although there is a recent resurgence in independent record labels

Recording companies often spend a lot of time and money in discovering new musicians or developing the talent of artists they already have signed up with a contract The association of the brand with the artists helps define the image of both the brand and the artist

In spite of the fact that both parties need each other to survive the relationship between record labels and artists can at times be a difficult one Many artists have had albums changed or censored in some way by the labels before they are released  songs being edited artwork or titles being changed etc Record labels generally do this because they believe that the album will sell better if the changes are made Often the record labels decisions are correct ones from a commercial perspective but this typically frustrates the artist who feels that their artwork is being destroyed 

In the early days of the recording industry record labels were absolutely necessary for the success of any artist The first goal of any new artist or band was to get signed to a contract as soon as possible In the 1940s 1950s and 1960s many artists were so desperate to sign a contract with a record company that they usually ended up signing a bad contract sometimes giving away the rights to their music in the process Entertainment lawyers are used by some to look over any contract before it is signed

In the 1970s and 1980s there was a phase of consolidation in the record industry that led to almost all major labels being owned by a very few multinational companies who in turn were members of the RIAA

In the 1990s due to the widespread use of home studios consumer CD recorders and the Internet independent labels began to become more commonplace Independent labels are typically artist owned with a focus usually on making good music and not necessarily on the business aspects of the industry or making lots of money Because of this independent artists usually receive less radio play and sell fewer CDs than artists signed to major labels However they usually have more control over the music and packaging of the released product

On occasion established artists once their record contract has finished move to an independent label This often gives the combined advantage of name recognition and more control over ones music Singers Dolly Parton Aimee Mann and Prince among others have achieved this 

While there are many independent labels folk singer Ani DiFrancos Righteous Babe Records is often cited as an ideal example The singer turned down lucrative contracts from several top name labels in order to establish her own New York based company Constant touring resulted in noteworthy success for an act without significant major funding Ani and others from the company have spoken on several occasions about their business model in hopes of encouraging others 

Some independent labels become successful enough that major record companies negotiate contracts to either distribute music for the label or in some cases purchase the label completely 

On the punk rock scene the DIY punk ethic encourages bands to self publish and self distribute This approach has been around since the early 1980s in an attempt to stay true to the punk ideals of doing it yourself and not selling out to corporate profits and control Such labels have a reputation for being fiercely uncompromising and especially unwilling to cooperate with the Big Five record labels at all

Main Article net label

With the Internet now being a viable source for obtaining music we see the emergence of net labels Depending on the ideals of the net label music files from the artists may be downloaded free of charge or for a fee that is paid via paypal or an online payment system Some of these labels also offer hard copy CDs in addition to direct download Most net labels acknowledge the Creative Commons licensing system thus reserving certain rights for the artist

 The emergence of open source labels  Main Article Open source record label

The new century brings the phenomenon of open source or open content record label These are inspired by the free software and open source movement and the success of GNULinux 

Examples are

A pipette is a glass tube used for delivery of a specific volume of a solution 

A smaller less accurate version known as a teat pipette is made of plastic and is filled by squeezing a plastic bubble at the top

A pipette used for the delivery of small fractions of a milliliter of a liquid is called a micropipette 

Rainin is the worlds largest developer and supplier of pipettes

Muscle is a tissue in animal bodies Muscles are contractile tissue This means they get shorter When they get shorter this is called contraction See for more muscle details

We use muscles to move our bodies Many muscles pull on bones to make our arms and legs move If we hurt ourselves then the nerves tell the brain to register the feeling as pain

There are three kinds of muscles

The Skeletal muscles move the limbs They move the jaw up and down so that food can be chewed Skeletal muscles are the only voluntary muscles This means they are the only muscle that you can choose to move

The Cardiac muscle is the muscle in the heart When this muscle contracts it pushes blood through the circulatory system The Cardiac muscle is not voluntary Animals do not choose for their heart to contract

The Smooth muscles are the other muscles in the body that are involuntary Smooth muscles are in many places They are in

Muscles are made of many muscle cells The cells contract together to make the muscle get shorter The muscle cells know to do this together because many of them get information sent to them by nerves Then cells that get the message from nerves tell other cells that are near them They tell the other cells by sending an electrical current

Muscle cells are filled with proteins called actin and myosin These are the proteins that make the muscle contract

When a nerve tells a muscle to contract the muscle opens holes in its cell membrane These holes are proteins that are called calcium channels Then calcium rushes into the cell Calcium also comes out of a special place in the cell called the sarcoplasmic reticulum This calcium sticks to the actin and myosin This makes these proteins contract

Contraction also needs ATP This is the energy that your cells use It is made from using glucose in the cell It takes a lot of energy to release contracted muscles They use most of the energy your body uses

Muscles work in pairs called antagonistic pairs

Exercise makes muscles get bigger Exercise also makes muscles stronger If a person does not exercise their muscles atrophy This means their muscles get smaller and weaker

There are many different kinds of muscle diseases There are three big groups of diseases

The Game Boy is a handheld console It was Nintendos first game console in the Game Boy range It was their first portable console to use game cartridges so it could play more than one game and you could take it anywhere Since 1989 the range has grown to include not only the original but also many other consoles such as Game Boy Color Game Boy Advance Game Boy Advance SP and Game Boy Micro All of these can play Game Boy games as well

The Game Boy has a green screen that can show four shades of grey or dark green Like the NES it has four buttons and a cross shaped direction all control The console has a single speaker but can be used with stereo headphones As many as four Game Boys can be connected together with special wires for games with more than one player

The idea for the Game Boy came from Gumpei Yokoi who also made many other Nintendo video game consoles

Nintendo made Game Watch games before the Game Boy and later the Nintendo DS after the Game Boy

The stomach is part of the digestive system It is a big sack between the esophagus and the small intestines The stomach is the second stage in the digestive process It holds food after ingestion Food in the stomach then passes through to the small intestine where most of the foods nutrition is absorbed

The stomach contains acid made by stomach cells This acid kills bacteria in the food Acid in the stomach may cause problems It can worsen peptic ulcer disease It can also cause gastroesophageal reflux pain in the chest when acid from the stomach refluxes the esophagus

Vomiting occurs when food goes back up the esophagus and out the mouth Vomiting can be a symptom of disease

Stomachs of other animals work differently than human stomachs Cows for example have a stomach with multiple compartments

Other words for stomach include belly and tummy

Pain is a symptom of being hurt or sick It is a bad sensation that is physical and emotional

Most pain starts when part of the body is hurt Nerves in that part send messages to the brain Those messages tell the brain that the body is being damaged Pain is not just the message the nerve sends to the brain It is the bad emotion felt because of that damage

The message that the nerve sends to the brain is called nociception What is experienced because of the nociception is pain

Pain can be acute or chronic Acute means it only happens a short time Chronic means the pain lasts a long time

Pain can be from different types of injury

Pain can also happen when there is no underlying injury or cause Pain can happen just because the nerves do not work right This is called neuropathic pain

For most pain the best treatment is to stop the damage that makes the pain If the ankle is sprained doctors tell the person not to walk on it They tell them to put ice on it This helps the injury stop For an ulcer in the stomach doctors stop the acid made in the stomach This helps the ulcer to heal

But many kinds of pain also need medicines to feel better There are many different kinds of medicines for pain

There are doctors who specialize in pain management These are usually anesthesiologists but may also have any one of a number of underlying areas of specialization such as neurology physiatry or internal medicine

A new genetic method of treating chronic pain is in the research stage The idea is to inactivate gene HCN2 which plays a key role in chronic pain Experiments on mice suggest this will work

Super Mario 64 is a video game created by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 Its the first Mario game that uses 3D graphics In 2004 the game was re released for the Nintendo DS as Super Mario 64 DS It has new characters you can play as and minigames Many fans and critics think that Super Mario 64 is one of the best video games ever made 

Mario an Italian plumber has to save Princess Peach from the reptile monster Bowser To do so he has to win stars by completing courses inside different paintings of the Mushroom Kingdom

The story begins when Peach invites Mario to her castle to give him a special cake that she has made for him By the time Mario arrives however Bowser has taken control of the castle and has kidnapped Peach and stolen the power of the castle Mario must save the princess and the kingdom before its too late

The main hub of the game is Princess Peachs castle There are many locked doors inside that the player must open with the stars that they have collected There are six stars within each level and a 100 coin star To unlock another world players must have the stars required One world requires two stars for instance Each locked door leads to more levels and to more difficult challenges Mario can also leave the castle and explore the small courtyard

In the original Super Smash Bros for the Nintendo 64 console Princess Toadstools castle is a playable stage in which the fighters fight on top of the roof Mario can be the owner of the area

In Mario Party Peachs stage is a large birthday cake which the player can travel through

Super Mario 64 DS is a remake made for the Nintendo DS console In this game Mario Luigi and Wario all get a letter saying Peach baked a cake for them Bowser has kidnapped Princess Peach Mario Luigi and Wario and has jailed them in Princess Peachs castle Yoshi is told that he must save them When the player finds keys they save a character and can play as them Super Mario 64 DS also has multiplayer minigames which are unlocked by getting keys

MPEG 1 Audio Layer 3 is a lossy data compression format for audio Using it makes smaller computer files containing digitized music and other sounds

The format is a lossy compression format This means that each time something is compressed with it some information is lost This information can not be recovered When encoding to MP3 the encoder is smart The human ear can not hear certain sounds if they are masked by other sounds This means that when encoding certain sound samples some sounds can be left out This makes it possible to compress audio by a factor of about 5 without noticeable change to the sound of the music

Many people like to use MP3 files to copy music so they can listen to it on their computer Record companies do not like it when people use the Internet to share these MP3 files with each other They think it is a violation of their copyright The record industries have a trade group called the RIAA that has taken people to court for sharing music An Internet website called Napster was shut down because of this Napster has since re opened but does not let people share MP3 files anymore

Other formats for audio compression are Ogg Vorbis and FLAC Ogg Vorbis is very similar to MP3 FLAC is a lossless compression and gets compression rates of 2 3

In 1980s Dieter Seitzer started the development of a code for audio format of high quality Together with his team at the German Fraunhofer Institut situated in Erlangen the professor had the idea to create code with a low bit rate The German institute received the patent for MP3 in 1989 MP3 was then passed to the International Organisation for Standardisation In the same year the MP3 was included into MPEG 1 specification

The first player to be able to read the MP3 format was designed by the same Fraunhofer Institute in 1990s A student named Tomislav Uzelac developed AMP MP3 Playback Engine in 1997 It represented the first device that could be called MP3 player After the player appeared on the Internet two students named Justin Frankel and Dmitry Boldyrev transformed it into Winamp They took the engine of the original player and added the interface of the famous WindowsfactdateApril 2009 

When Winamp was launched into the net for free use it became successful at once This way began the era of free music download Soon various programmers started creating additional features for the MP3 player Very often they created new encoders rippers and players

Because there is no need to pay licensing fees in order to build the player today many MP3 players are for free The most famous MP3 players are Winamp Sonique iTunes and MusicMatch The main feature of an MP3 player is to turn the MP3 files into standard audio form and then send them to the soundcard of the computer The soundcard then outputs the files into speaker so the user can hear them Every MP3 player interprets music differently though each one of them uses the same code for playing the MP3 files

King Crimson is a progressive rock band They formed in England in 1969 Their music is usually called progressive rock but they also have jazz Gamelan Music Classical music heavy metal and experimental music in their sound They are not very popular but they have a loyal group of fans Their music has influenced a lot of bands and styles of music King Crimson is most well known for their first album In the Court of the Crimson King which helped create Progressive Rock Only one person has been in the band since they started guitarist Robert Fripp Right now the people in the band are Robert Fripp on guitar Adrian Belew on guitar Tony Levin on Bass and Pat Mastelotto on drums

In 1967 drummer Michael Giles and his brother Peter a bass guitar player started a band with Robert Fripp They recorded one album called The Cheerful Insanity of Giles Giles and Fripp This album did not do very well and a lot of critics wrote bad reviews of it After this Ian Mcdonald joined playing keyboards reeds and woodwind instruments Ian McDonalds friend Peter Sinfield joined to write lyrics and Greg Lake replaced Peter Giles on bass guitar Then they bought a mellotron which helped them sound more like classical music They changed their name to King Crimson and did their first show in Hyde Park London in 1969 Their first CD In the Court of the Crimson King was a huge success Their original style impressed fans and critics

Micheal Giles and Ian Mcdonald left the band to do solo work The three of them still in the band Robert fripp Peter sinfield and Greg Lake released the single CatfoodGroon On the next album woodwind player Mel Collins singer Gordon Haskell and Peter Giles all helped record a few songs with the band King Crimson released their second album In the Wake of Poseidon in 1970 It was not very popular because it sounded too much like the first album

The Yardbirds are a English blues band They formed in the 1960s They are famous for having the guitarists Eric Clapton Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page Eric Clapton left the band after they turned from a blues band to a pop band in keeping with the moving trend of music in the 1960s He suggested Jimmy Page who had been a studio musician at the time Unwilling to give up his career as a studio musician Page suggested Jeff Beck Shortly thereafter Page joined the band playing bass and lead guitar 

The Grateful Dead is a jam band who formed in San Francisco California United States in the 1960s They are known for their stage shows and devoted followers called Deadheads Jerry Garcia lead the band until he died in 1995 Then The Grateful Dead disband But The rest of the band members made a new band called the Dead The Grateful Dead logo was the dancing bears Later to the skull and roses in a album called Steal your Face The Grateful dead were around for 1965 to 1995 The first band name was the warlocks In the late 60s the band went to Woodstock The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in the San Francisco Bay Area1 The band was known for its unique and eclectic style which fused elements of rock folk bluegrass blues reggae country improvisational jazz psychedelia and space rock23and for live performances of long musical improvisation14 Their music writes Lenny Kaye touches on ground that most other groups dont even know exists5 These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world6 They were ranked 57th in the issue The Greatest Artists of all Time by Rolling Stone magazine7

The fans of the Grateful Dead some of whom followed the band from concert to concert for years are known as Deadheads and are known for their dedication to the bands music14 Many referred to the band simply as the Dead

John Dawson Winter III is an albino blues musician from Beaumount Texas United States His brother Edgar Winter is also a famous musician He also works as producer and produced two Grammy winning albums of Muddy Waters

Edgar Winter is an albino musician from Beaumont Texas He is the brother of Johnny Winter who is also a famous musician He mostly plays keyboards and the saxophone

Albinism is a condition some people and animals are born with This condition is caused by a lack of pigment in their hair eyes and skin A person or animal with albinism is called an albino but people may prefer to be called a person with albinism

People with albinism usually have white or light blonde hair and very fair skin Their eyes are blue or rarely pink ish People with albinism do have some problems including bad vision and getting sunburn easily All of these problems are because people with alibinism have little or no pigments in their eyes skin and hair

Vision problems in albinism include nystagmus strabismus and refractory errors

Albino animals are more easily seen and so may be attacked by predators They lack the camouflage that the non albino members of their species have Also where colour is a factor in mate selection they may be at a disadvantage there too

Albinism is a hereditary condition It is usually inherited in a recessive pattern it means both parents should carry the albinism gene to have a child with albinism

Paco de Lucia is a famous Flamenco guitar player from Spain

Hearing is one of the five senses The ears are used for hearing sounds The noun form of hearing may also be used to refer to a meeting usually one where the public is invited to come and help decide something

Sometimes the phrase I hear you can be used to mean I understand It is harder to hear a sound made farther away It is also harder to hear a sound when other sounds are louder

Sounds pass into our ear and make the eardrum vibrate which makes the tiny bones inside The bones vibrate a small tube shaped like a snail shell called the cochlea Inside the cochlea is a fluid which moves tiny hairs that send signals to the brain

Three canals next to the cochlea in the inner ear help us keep our balance They let the brain know what movements the body is making Ballet dancers need excellent balance

South Holland is a province in the west of the Netherlands It is called Zuid Holland in Dutch It is surrounded by the North Sea and the provinces North Holland Utrecht Guelders North Brabant and Zeeland

345 million people live there The biggest cities are Rotterdam and The Hague The Hague is the capital of the province The Hague is also the administrative capital of the Netherlands That means that the parliament is there

Rotterdam has the largest port of Europe Leiden Gouda and Delft have town centers with many old buildings Zoetermeer is a quite new city Most of it was built in the 1970s Another important city is Dordrecht

In South Holland there are some typical Dutch landscapes Near Leiden there is a region that is known as the Bollenstreek In springtime many large fields with flowers can be found here These fields are called bulb fields Near Rotterdam there is a small village called Kinderdijk with 19 windmills near each other

The area south of The Hague is called Westland Here are many greenhouses

The south of the province has many islands The largest of them are Voorne Putten Goeree Overflakkee IJsselmonde the Hoeksche Waard and the island of Dordrecht These big islands are connected by bridges andor tunnels

The most important rivers and other bodies of waters are Nieuwe Maas Nieuwe Waterweg Oude Maas Haringvliet and Hollands Diep

Grand Theft Auto is a series of video games The first was released in the late 90s This game was played from a birds eye view meaning that it was like playing the game from a helicopter The second was called GTA 2 and also a add on pack was added for the first game called GTA London which was set in the 60s

Then came the next games which were made in 3D which changed the way Grand Theft Auto was played The first in the 3D series was called Grand Theft Auto III which was set in Liberty City which is like New York Then there was Grand Theft Auto Vice City which was set in the middle 80s It was very much like Miami in Florida The latest game in the 3D series is called Grand Theft Auto San Andreas which is based on Los Angeles San Francisco and Las Vegas This game was a very big improvement from the older game because the map was so much bigger

Grand Theft Auto IV was officially announced at the Microsoft 2006 E3 Press Conference on May 10 2006 Grand Theft Auto IV is now being sold inside stores starting now Grand Theft Auto IV now has 2 episodes and a complete collection

There has been a lot of arguing or controversy about these games Many people do not like how the player can murder random people and sleep with prostitutes Because of this all 3 D GTA games have been rated Mature so far

The PlayStation Portable or PSP is Sonys second video game console to be a handheld after the PocketStation It was made in Japan and came out there first on December 12 2004 After that it came out in North America on March 24 2005 and came out in Europe on September 1 2005 It was first announced in 2003 at E3 and then next year its first design was shown off It can play PSP video games as well as music video and pictures To transfer music videos or pictures to a PSP you must use a USB cable to send the files from a computer to it The games and movies come on a disc called the Universal Media Disc which holds 18 GB A Memory Stick Pro Duo can also be used for memory storage The PlayStation Portable is the first handheld game console to use a disc as its media storage instead of a cartridge

There are many games out for the PSP over 500 The movies look like the DVD The reason the PSP can have movies is because the disk has a lot of memory space For many countries Spider Man 2 for example was included for free with the console

The PSP is wireless meaning it can connect to the Internet without any cables This is called Wi Fi This allows players who are traveling to download items surf the web and play online The PlayStation Portable can also connect with the PlayStation 3 as a sort of remote control for movie playback and for downloading content

There have been four versions of the original PSP the PSP 1000 the PSP N 1000 PSP 2000 and the PSP 3000 The PSP Go is the latest version of Sonys handheld now with a sliding screen design bluetooth and internal storage of 16GB replacing the UMD Drive Sony recently revealed the succesor of the PSP which is called Vita It will be released in early 2012

The PlayStation Portable is similar to the Nintendo DS because they are both for games you can take with you However Nintendo and Sony said they were made for different people The DS has sold more units than the PSP

In mammals an abortion is when a pregnancy ends early without the birth of babies Abortions can occur naturally usually because something went wrong with the pregnancy When this happens it is called a miscarriage Humans can also end the pregnancy on purpose before birth takes place This is called an induced abortion

A developing human takes about thirty eight weeks to grow and be born Normally this occurs about forty weeks after the mothers last menstrual period This developing human is called embryo for the first eight weeks of the pregnancy and fetus for the remaining thirty two

There are two kinds of abortion Sometimes things go wrong during a pregnancy These things may lead to the death of the embryo or fetus Depending on what time in pregnancy they happen in such abortions are called miscarriage or stillbirth

In some cases finishing the pregnancy might be very dangerous for the pregnant woman Giving birth might also be very difficult for her she may have many worries or she might not want to have a baby at all In such cases things can be done to end the pregnancy on purpose This is called an induced abortion 

In both types of abortion the embryo or fetus usually comes out of the womb This is called a complete abortion In some cases the embryo or fetus remains inside the womb This is called a missed abortion Surgery is needed to remove the embryo or fetus from the womb so the woman does not get an infection

People speak of spontaneous abortion or miscarriage when the embryo or fetus is lost due to natural causes before the 20th week of pregnancy A pregnancy that ends this way but that is between 20 and 37 weeks old is known as premature birth if the baby is born alive If the fetus dies in the womb after 20 weeks or while it is born this is known as stillbirth Premature births and stillbirths are generally not considered to be miscarriages

Spontaneous abortions are common About fifteen percent of pregnancies end in spontaneous abortion In many cases the woman is not even aware she was pregnant The pregnancy is only a few days or weeks old and the woman believes the miscarriage is just her menses About twenty five percent of all women will have a spontaneous abortion during their lives

Most miscarriages occur very early Between ten and fifty percent of pregnancies end with a miscarriage where the mother or the doctors are aware of it These figures depend on the age and health of the pregnant woman Most spontaneous abortions occur so early in the pregnancy that the woman is not even aware that she was pregnant One particular study showed a rate of pregnancy in exposed ovulatory cycles of 596 with 619 of conceptuses lost before twelve weeks 917 of these occuried subclinically without the knowledge of the mother

The risk of spontaneous abortion decreases sharply after the 10th week of pregnancy with a loss rate between 85 weeks LMP and birth of about two percent pregnancy loss is virtually complete by the end of the embryonic period

Those people who have already had several spontaneous or induced abortions run a greater risk of having a spontaneous one Those with certain diseases and those over the age 35 also run a greater risk Other causes for abortions can be the infection of either the woman or embryofetus or their immune response Certain diseases or an accidental trauma can also cause a spontaneous abortion Putting the woman under trauma or stress to cause miscarriage is considered induced abortion Some countries call this feticide

Most miscarriages are due to problems with the copying of chromosomes but some are caused by environmental factors When a human is conceived it gets 23 chromosomes from its mother and 23 from its father If it does not get the right number its development happens wrong It may have many bad birth defects

Most embryos and fetuses with chromosome problems will not live for a long time They die very early There are a few chromosome problems that babies can sometimes be born with For example Down Syndrome happens when there are three copies of chromosome 21 This is called trisomy 21

The most common symptom is bleeding from the vagina This can be very little blood It can be very much blood Some women have bad pains in their low abdomen when they have a miscarriage This is sometimes like the pain of menses It can be much worse Or a woman may have no pain at all If the pregnancy is many weeks old the woman may see the embryo or fetus when it comes out But if it is less than 12 weeks old a woman may not see anything but blood

Sometimes no treatment is needed Sometimes doctors do a surgical abortion This is the same kind of surgery that is done for induced abortions Sometimes doctors give women medicines to help the miscarriage finish without needing surgery

An induced abortion is when things are done to end the pregnancy on purpose These things are normally done by doctors In countries where abortion can be done legally it is often done by specialists who know a lot about womens bodies Abortions done illegally are often performed by people without this special knowledge This makes them more dangerous Such abortions are usually called unsafe abortions back alley abortions or DIY abortions mainly because the risk to the health of the mother is much higher than with abortions carried out by skilled doctors 

There can be medical reasons why an abortion is performed These include

Surgical induced abortions are where the embryo or fetus is taken out by a physical act The kind of surgical abortion done depends on how long the pregnancy has gone on It is easier in earlier stages of the pregnancy There are less problems that can occur So it is best to do a surgical abortion as early as possible

Medical abortions are where a doctor gives a woman a medicine to end the pregnancy There are two medicines used for this The medicines are mifepristone and methotrexate These two medicines both stop the pregnancy Then the abortion happens like a spontaneous abortion

A pregnancy that ends without a child being born also may cause some problems to the woman this happens to There are two broad groups of things that can happen

Abortion is safer than childbirth if it is done before the 16th week of pregnancy and it is done by a professional Certain methods of abortion are pretty safe and complications are rare Generally stopping a pregnancy that has gone on longer is riskier

Women usually feel a small amount of pain during first trimester abortion In a 1979 study of 2299 patients 97 reported having some amount of pain Patients rated the pain as being less than earache or toothache but more than headache or backache

Local and general anesthesias are used during the abortion

Few studies have been done to see if an abortion affects the woman psychologically or mentally Those that have been done give contradictory results One study looked at 13000 women who had become pregnant even though they did not want to The study found that having an induced abortion does not increase the risk of getting mental health problems the group that was compared were women who also did not want to have a baby but who did not have an abortion Other studies showed similar results women who had an abortion did better in school or at work after the abortion Another study showed that women who had an abortion had a higher self esteem and felt better than those who did not

Many women who had an abortion felt better afterwards they also felt relieved They would do it again in a similar situation

A study done in New Zealand in 2006 showed that many women who had an abortion developed severe depressions up to 4 years after they had the abortion They were also more likely have problems with alcohol and illegal drugs than those women who did not have an abortion The person who oversaw the study later told media that given these results it would be very hard to say that having an abortion has no psychological effects on the womam who has is He called the abortion a traumatic experience

Both spontaneous and induced abortions have some risk for the woman

If a bad thing happens because of a surgery or medicine that a doctor gives or because of a miscarriage it is called a complication Complications of abortions can be infection bleeding pain There may or may not be problems getting pregnant again this is still being researched In places where induced abortions are legal less than 1 of induced abortions have a bad complication If doctors do induced abortions the risk to the woman is less than the risk of complications of childbirth In places where induced abortions are legal less women have complications of induced abortion than in places where induced abortion is illegal This is because induced abortions that are not done by doctors have much more risks For example after induced abortions became legal in the United States in 1973 less women died from having abortions In the United States in 2000 11 women died from the complications of legal abortionrefabortion2 The risk of death from a legal abortion is 1100 of the risk of an appendectomyrefabortion3 The risk of death from an injection of penicillin is bigger than the risk of death from a legal abortionrefabortion4

There can be emotional problems for the woman after a spontaneous or induced abortion She may feel sad angry or guilty that she had a miscarriage or asked for an abortion She may think she has done something that made the miscarriage happen or that having an abortion was the wrong thing to do and because of this she may feel intense griefrefabortion5 There are many places where women can get help dealing with these feelings

Some women who have induced abortions may get criticism from friends or family who have different beliefs When scientists look at this in research studies however they do not usually see that women have emotional problems after induced abortions In 1987 President Ronald Reagan told the Surgeon General of the US to look at this question Both president Reagan and the Surgeon General C Everett Koop did not think abortion was right Dr Koop looked at 250 papers that scientists wrote in scientific journals Dr Koop said that the science we know does not show that induced abortions cause emotional problems for women who have themrefabortion6

The number of induced abortions done are different for different parts of the world This is also true for the reasons why women decide to have an abortion Estimates are that about 46 million induced abortions are done worldwide every year 26 million of them occur in places where abortion is legal 20 million happen in countries where it is illegal to have an abortion Some countries like Belgium and the Netherlands have a low rate of induced abortion Others like Russia and Vietnam have a comparatively high rate Overall there are 26 induced abortions per 100 known pregnancies

Abortion rates vary The length the pregnancy has gone on and the method used to do the abortion influence these rates According to data collected in the United States 882 of abortions were done in the first twelve weeks of pregnancy 104 between week 13 and week 20 of the pregnancy The remaining 14 were done in week 21 or later 

909 were done by curettage 77 were medical abortions 04 by intrauterine instillation and 10 by other The Guttmacher Institute estimated there were 2200 intact dilation and extraction procedures in the US during 2000  017 of the total number of abortions performed that year Similarly in England and Wales in 2006 89 of terminations occurred at or under 12 weeks 9 between 13 and 19 weeks and 15 at or over 20 weeks 64 of those reported were by vacuum aspiration 6 by DE and 30 were medical Later abortions are more common in China India and other developing countries than in developed countries

In 1998 a study was done in 27 countries This study wanted to find the reasons why women wanted to end their pregnancy It found that women often gave one of the following reasons

A different study done in the United States in 2004 came to similar conclusions 

Women who had an abortion in Finland and the United States usually did not state that the pregnancy posed a risk to their health In Bangladesh India and Kenya however more such women thought the pregnancy was a risk to their health 1 of women in the 2004 survey based US study became pregnant as a result of rape and 05 as a result of incest Another American study in 2002 concluded that 54 of women who had an abortion were using a form of contraception at the time of becoming pregnant Inconsistent use was reported by 49 of those using condoms and 76 of those using the combined oral contraceptive pill 42 of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage The Guttmacher Institute estimated that most abortions in the United States are obtained by minority women because minority women have much higher rates of unintended pregnancy

Some women have an abortion because the society they live in pressures them to 

Any of these factors might force a pregnant woman to have an abortion

Induced abortion is not legal in every place In some countries a doctor who does an induced abortion is committing a crime In the United States Canada and many countries in Europe abortion is legal In some countries like Ireland and Somalia it is legal only to save the life of the woman If a woman is raped in Ireland and becomes pregnant she cannot get an induced abortion In some countries like Chile and El Salvador abortion is never legal including in cases where the woman risks dying from continuing the pregnancy

In countries where induced abortion is not legal many more women die from abortion Women still get induced abortions but they cannot get them in safe hospitals and clinics These induced abortions have more complications than abortions done by doctors

Women who live in places where abortion is illegal or heavily frowned upon sometimes travel to other places where an abortion can be done legally so they can have an abortion This is a form of medical tourism

Spontaneous abortion occurs in various mammals In sheep it may be caused by crowding through doors or by being chased by dogs In cows abortion may be caused by contagious diseases such as Brucellosis or Campylobacter This can often be controlled by vaccination though 

Abortion may also be induced in animals in the context of animal husbandry For example abortion may be induced in mares that have been mated improperly or that have been purchased by owners who did not realize the mares were pregnant or that are pregnant with twin foals

Feticide can occur in horses and zebras Usually this is done because males harass pregnant mares or force copulation Scientists have raised the question how often this occurs in the wild though Male Gray langur monkeys may attack females following male takeover causing miscarriage

Induced abortion is a subject that is controversial Each person has a system of moral values Based on their system of morals people have different opinions about it Religion can also influence this opinion 

A number of opinion polls have been carried out around the world They have tried to find out what people think about abortion Results were different for different countries but also varied with the questions that were asked 

In May 2005 a survey was done in ten European countries The people were asked if they could agree with the statement If a woman does not want children she should be allowed to have an abortion The highest level of approval was 81 in the Czech Republic the lowest was 47 in Poland

A poll was done in November 2001 The poll asked people in Canada in what circumstances they believed an abortion should be permitted 32 responded that they believe abortion should be legal in all circumstances 52 that it should be legal in certain circumstances and 14 that it should never be legal A similar poll in April 2009 surveyed people in the United States about abortion 18 said that abortion should be legal in all cases 28 said that abortion should be legal in most cases 28 said abortion should be illegal in most cases and 16 said abortion should be illegal in all cases A November 2005 poll in Mexico found that 734 think abortion should not be legalized while 112 think it should

Of attitudes in South America a December 2003 survey found that 30 of Argentines thought that abortion should be allowed in Argentina regardless of situation 47 that it should be allowed under some circumstances and 23 that it should not be allowed regardless of situation A March 2007 poll about abortion in Brazil found that 65 of Brazilians believe that it should not be modified 16 that it should be expanded to allow abortion in other cases 10 that abortion should be decriminalized and 5 were not sure A July 2005 poll in Colombia found that 656 said they thought that abortion should remain illegal 269 that it should be made legal and 75 that they were unsure

Some people feel very strongly about abortion People who think that abortion is wrong and that the law should not allow it are called pro life People who think think the law should let women choose to have abortions are called pro choice 

People who are pro life believe that all humans including embryos and fetuses have a right to life For this reason they believe abortion is wrong sometimes comparing it to murder They think the law should make abortion a crime in order to protect embryos and fetuses However though pro life people think abortion is wrong there are special cases in which they will sometimes support allowing an abortion to happen like if the pregnancy puts the womans life at risk or if she got pregnant from rape Pro life people think women who are pregnant and do not want to raise a child should give the baby up for adoption instead of having an abortion They have started advocacy groups like the American Life League to try to convince more people to think abortion is wrong and to try to get governments to make laws to restrict abortion Sometimes people who are against abortion have used violence to try to stop abortions from happening like bombing the clinics that do abortions or shooting the people who work inside them However most people who are against abortion do not do such things and believe that they are wrong and so they try to stop abortions from happening through peaceful activism

People who are pro choice believe that women should be allowed to have control over their own bodies when it comes to ending or continuing a pregnancy They believe that because the embryo or fetus is inside the womans body and does not have developed enough organs to survive on its own until later in the pregnancy it is not yet a person with rights Pro choice people also make the argument that abortion needs to be legal in order to protect women because when abortion is illegal it does not completely stop abortions from happening but makes it so that women try to do abortions on themselves or get them done by people who are not trained doctors which puts those women in danger of death or injury Pro choice people believe the way to prevent abortion is to make sure women only get pregnant when they want to In addition to advocating the legality of abortion pro choice groups like Planned Parenthood often try to improve peoples access to things used to prevent pregnancy and try to teach young people about sex to reduce the number of teen pregnancies

Many religions have a view on abortion These views span a broad spectrum from acceptance to rejection Most religions generally oppose abortion 

Generally when there is a debate about whether abortion laws should be changed in a country there are advocacy groups Some of the arguments these groups often have are outlined below

There is a hypothesis that induced abortion raises the risk of getting breast cancer People who support this call it a link rather than a hypothesis The subject has been controversial but currently scientists agree that there is no link between abortion in the first trimester and increasing the risk to get breast cancer

In early pregnancy levels of estrogen increase This causes the breast to grow and to prepare for lactation In the 1890s studies were done on rats before this hypothesis was put forward

It is currently unclear from what moment the embryo or fetus can feel pain This is also used in the debate about abortion Many researchers think that a fetus is unlikely to feel pain until after the seventh month of pregnancy Others disagree At about twenty six weeks of pregnancy certain connections are made in the thalamus of the growing fetus Developmental neurobiologists suspect that these connections may be critical to perception of pain by the fetus However legislation has been proposed by pro life advocates requiring abortion providers to tell a woman that the embryo or fetus may feel pain during an abortion procedure But as the law states that its only legal to terminate before twenty weeks there is no likely wood that the embryo would feel anything

Researchers from the University of California San Francisco published a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association The study analyzed data from dozens of medical reports and other studies The researchers concluded that fetuses are unlikely to feel pain until the third trimester of pregnancy However a number of medical critics have since disputed these conclusions There are certain connections in the thalamus of the fetuse These connections develop at about twenty six weeks of pregnancy At the end of the 20th century there was an emerging consensus among developmental neurobiologists that these connections are very important when it comes to the perception of pain in the fetus Other researchers such as Anand and Fisk have challenged this late date positing that pain can be felt around twenty weeks Pain can have many different aspects It might be purely relying on sensory input but it might also involve emotions and thought For this reason it is perhaps impossible to know exactly when the embryo or fetus feels pain even if it has developed the links in the thalamus

A clock is a device that tells the time Some clocks can give the date as well as the time There are different types of clocks A watch is a type of clock that is small and can be carried Watches are usually worn on a persons wrist At one time watches were commonly kept in the persons pocket 

Clocks use different ways to tell time Clocks need some sort of steady beat or motion to track the change in time Ancient water clocks worked by the steady movement of water from a container with a hole in the bottom to another container without a hole Other clocks use springs and gears to track the change in time correctly

Digital clocks work by measuring the vibrations of quartz crystals when charged with electricity The amount of vibrations from a quartz crystal per second does not change 

Atomic clocks use the electromagnetic waves absorbed and emitted by atoms such as caesium to measure time They are the most precise clocks in the world

There are many types of clocks and watches The two most common types of displays on clocks are analog and digital 

Analog clocks use angles to tell time They have hands that rotate around the clocks face The position of the hands shows the time The face of the clock is a flat disk It will often have the numbers one through twelve on the face to make it easier to read Analog clocks commonly have two or three hands If it has two there is a large hand or minute hand and a smaller hand the hour hand Clocks with three hands also have a second hand This hand is usually about as long as the minute hand but much thinner Each hand shows the time it is named for and moves around the face of the clock one complete rotation for each movement to the next larger hand For example the second hand moves around the face of the clock in 60 seconds It moves once each second When it moves all the way around the clock the minute hand moves forward one space When the minute hand moves all the way around the face of the clock the hour hand moves forward one section The second and minute hands take 60 movements to move all around the face of the clock the hour hand only needs 12 movements to do the same 

Digital clocks use numbers to show the time LCDs and LEDs are common for digital clocks Unlike analog clocks which are based on 12 hours digital clocks can use either a 12 hour clock or a 24 hour clock Digital clocks are usually smaller and easier to both use and read than analog clocks but they can also be made much larger New digital clocks can even correct themselves using the internet or radio signals 

A small number of clocks will use sound to show the time The sound could be as simple as a bell or so complex that it sounds the same as a person These clocks are often used by people who are blind or cannot see well enough to read an analog or digital clock They can also be used by people with mental problems that cause them to be unable to read other clocks

Water clocks were used by the ancient English

There are many different types of clocks and watches They are different in what they are used for what they can do or how they are made Examples include

Sexual orientation is a term that means what kinds of people a person loves or has sexual or romantic feelings about A person can love somebody of the same gender somebody of the other gender both or neither

The words that are used the most to talk about somebodys sexual orientation are

Pansexuality

Words that are sometimes also used to talk about somebodys sexual orientation are

Not everyone agrees that some of these last terms are really sexual orientations For example a person can have a fetish and still be either heterosexual homosexual or bisexual A person can also be transgender or transsexual and still be either heterosexual homosexual or bisexual

Many people have been discriminated against because of their sexual orientation In many cultures people who are homosexual or bisexual have been teased fired from their job or made to suffer violence because of who they are In many countries and states there are laws against having sex with somebody of the same gender and people can be put in jail because of who they have sex with In the United States these laws were struck down by the United States Supreme Court in the last few years

A smiley is a picture of a smiling face that is used to show emotion The first smileys to be widely used were made as yellow buttons but now the most common smileys are made using computer keyboard symbols Smileys are used by many people in emails and other types of computer messages A smiley is also sometimes spelt wrongly as smily or smilie

There were a number of early uses of simple graphics representing a smiling face Some of these used a large circle containing two dots for eyes and a curve for the mouth The most well known smiley face was created in 1963 by Harvey Ball for an insurance company in Massachusetts This design was a bright yellow circle representing a face with black oval eyes and a big curved mouth with smile creases at the ends

The design was made popular in the early 1970s by a pair of brothers Murray and Bernard Spain who though of a great plan to sell novelty items The two used the smiley face on buttons as well to decorate coffee mugs t shirts bumper stickers and many other things They also used the phrase Have a happy day Smiley buttons were very popular from the 1970s onwards

Smiley is a brand developed by Franklin Loufrani since 1971 He controls Smileyworld Ltd a company whose mission is to make the world a happier place to live Its brand Smiley is sold all over the world in several lifestyle industries and its designers are constantly developing very creative and edgy products The company donates ten percent of its royalties to a charity called the Smiley World Association active with social actions in several countries Its baseline is Share your smile with those in need

In 1997 Franklins son Nicolas Loufrani has started to create a new world with icons based on the original Smiley logo Today over 1200 icons are used as part of a brand called Smileyworld This brand is based on a communication concept aimed at helping people to communicate better through various social expression products It is also an educative project with books toys interactive products as well as a lifestyle brand for children

Smiley has been a registered trademark since 1971 The Smiley name and logo now registered and used in over 100 countries for 25 classes of goods and services More than 1200 Smiley emoticons are registered with the Washington Library of Congress and protected by the Universal Copyrights Convention In the past 10 years Smileyworld Ltd has signed more than 800 licensing contracts worldwide and has been using its rights in most classes of goods and services in all important countries on the 5 continents Smileyworld Ltd works with over 60 law firms to protect its IP

In the 1990s people started using the internet and emails as a regular way of communicating So that they could show happiness or fun in an easy way people started making little smiling faces using some of the symbols on the keyboard A keyboard smiley has a colon for the eyes a hyphen  for the nose and a parenthesis for the mouth Some people make the smiley without the hyphen for a nose The smileys that are made in this way are sideways

Here is a smiley

When you tilt your head to the left it looks like a smiling face

Smileys are usually used as part of a written message but sometimes a smiley is just sent on its own to say I am happy with your last message Smileys are a useful way to show feelings to someone who cannot see the face of person sending the message

Intersex is a condition which occurs in species which use sexual reproduction It refers to those individuals which have sexual characteristics midway between normal males and normal females

A persons genitalia may be malformed They may also have male andor female secondary sex characteristics Such a person may be called intersexual

About 1 in 100 babies are born with an intersex condition and 1 in 1000 babies have an intersex condition that needs surgery It can be difficult to determine if an intersex baby is genetically male or female Sometimes the condition may appear when the baby reaches puberty or becomes an adult 

Intersexual are not hermaphrodites That term is only used for animals which have both natural male and female organs 

Most causes of intersexuality are congenital That means people are born with it usually because of agenetic condition All development is governed by genes which regulate the process of growth

The most common condition that causes intersexuality is Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia This is a condition that causes genetically female fetuses to have a male body appearance such as having a penis instead of a clitoris and a scrotum instead of labia This is because the babies adrenal gland produces higher levels of androgen hormones This may cause the baby to appear male when it has female chromosomes even to doctors and parents

Surgery is usually used on intersexed babies to give function to the genitals or a more usual appearance The surgery usually makes the baby look female as this is less complicated When they become adults some people agree with this surgery as it made their life easier when they were a child However some people do not agree with the surgery as they may not identify with the gender the doctor chose for them Some people who had surgery to make them look female have a male gender identity Some people who had surgery to make them look male have a female gender identity Some surgery may cause loss of sensation or cause pain when they have sex Some of these intersexual people want doctors to stop doing surgery on intersexed babies If a baby has an intersex condition that can come with either gender identity some doctors now say they should not do surgery early They say they should wait until the baby is older then the child adult or teenager can tell doctors his or her gender identity

The gastrointestinal system is the body system that eats and digests food it is also called a digestive system By breaking down food into simple chemicals that can be absorbed by other parts of the body so the chemicals can be used for energy and building the body it also gets rid of waste after digestion The gastrointestinal system starts at the lips and ends at the anus Animals like worms insects mammals birds fish and people all have digestive systems

The gastrointestinal tract is the gut and other organs that help us digest food

The gut is the round tubes that food goes through and is digested The parts of the human and some other animals gut system are

Other organs that are part of the gastrointestinal system but are not part of the gut are

Food does not go through these organs But they help the gut digest the food They also have other work For example the pancreas thyroid liver and parathyroids are also endocrine glands that make hormones like insulin

There are many diseases that affect the gastrointestinal system Doctors who study the gastrointestinal tract are called gastroenterologists 

The mouth is the hole in the face where we put food when we eat It is the first part of the gastrointestinal system

The mouth has teeth to help chew the food We use our mouth for many things We eat with it But we also talk kiss and show our emotions with it

The liver is an organ in the abdomen It is part of the gastrointestinal system Sometimes people use hepato as a prefix when they talk about the liver For example if people talk about liver cells they say hepatocellular Another word for liver cell is hepatocyte

The liver does many important things in the body

There are many different liver diseases Liver disease can make someone very very sick because of all the important work the liver does People who have bad liver disease usually die unless they can get a Liver transplant This is where the liver from someone who has just died is put in another person This is very difficult surgery But surgeons do it because it can save a persons life

The symptoms of liver disease happen because the liver does not do the work it should 

The liver cannot metabolize toxins and waste so these bad things stay in the blood longer than they otherwise would One thing that builds up is a substance called bilirubin When red blood cells die the hemoglobin in them leaks into the blood The hemoglobin becomes bilirubin The liver takes the bilirubin out of the blood and puts it into the bile The bile goes into the intestines and then goes out with the waste from your body If the liver is hurt it does not remove the bilirubin so the bilirubin stays in the body This makes the persons body look yellow and is known as jaundice So yellow eyes and yellow skin are symptoms of liver disease

Other symptoms of liver disease are

Hepatitis is when liver cells get inflamed This can be from virus infections This can be from toxins or poisons This can be from genetic disease This can be from autoimmune diseases when the bodys immune system hurts itself

Cirrhosis is from death of liver cells that happens again and again When the cells die scar tissue forms This scar tissue damages the structure of the liver This makes the liver not work as well But it also makes the pressure in the veins that go to the liver very high This high pressure makes esophageal varices The most common reason for cirrhosis in the world is hepatitis B virus infection

Some diseases cause bad things to build up in the liver Hemochromatosis causes extra iron to build up in the liver Wilsons disease causes extra copper to build up in the liver Both of these diseases hurt the cells and can cause very bad liver disease that kills people

You can also get cancer of your liver This can be metastatic cancer that came from some other place in your body The liver is a common place to get metastases because it takes bad things out of the blood So it takes cancer cells out of the blood and they grow in the liver Cancer can also grow from the liver If it grows from the liver it is called hepatocellular carcinoma if it is from liver cells Most hepatocellular carcinoma is from cirrhosis If it is from the cells that line the bile ducts in the liver it is called cholangiocarcinoma

Some liver diseases can be treated easily with medicine Hemochromatosis is treated just by taking blood from people every 2 months

Some liver diseases can be stopped before they start Two types of viral hepatitis can be stopped with an immunization Hepatitis A and B viruses can be stopped with a total of 5 shots in a persons life 

Some liver diseases can only be treated with liver transplant

A clot is a semi solid substance that blood forms especially when it is in air When you bleed your body makes the blood turn into a clot at the injury

When blood makes a clot it is also called coagulation

If a person gets a cut on their body that person may bleed To stop the bleeding the human body does several things First the brain orders the liver to produce chemicals that will help the clot to form When the chemicals released by the liver arrive at the injury the coagulation begins In the mean time the brain also lessens the blood flow near the injury so that not as much blood is lost 

There is a limit to how quickly a clot can form If the cut is very deep and the person bleeds too much a clot may not be able to form and a lot of blood may be lost

One of the worlds greatest engineering feats is in Palm Springs The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway brings visitors from the floor of the valley to the top of Mount San Jacinto 8516 feet up

Derivative work is a phrase used in copyright law It is piece of work that is based on what someone else created

Copyright law says that if someone writes a book or draws a picture or writes a song then it belongs to them Other people are not allowed to copy it unless the person who created it says that they can This is important because it means The person who created the work can sell what they created and get money 

A derivative work is one that is based on something else If a person watchs a movie and then writes a story about the people in the movie that story is a derivative work If after hearing a song someone sings the same tune with different words the song they sung is a derivative work 

In the law if someone else has a copyright on something no one is allowed to create a derivative work unless they say it is allowed So if someone watchs a movie they are not allowed to write a story about the people in the movie unless the people who made the movie give them permission 

This only applies to the things that are known about by the person creating the work If a movie is made but they do not go and see the movie and then they write a book that has the same story as the movie that is not a derivative work

Rugby football is a sport that people play around the world Many people play rugby in the UK Australia New Zealand Ireland Italy France South Africa Argentina Japan USA Canada the Pacific Islands and some 100 other countries It is the Worlds premier oval ball football and is usually just called rugby

Rugby football is named after a school in England called Rugby school Legend has it that one day in 1823 a senior boy called William Webb Ellis elected to run with the ball rather than retiring to kick it as was the normal mode of play in Rugby School football matches Running in was not considered quite the done thing then but was later formalised in the laws of Rugby Football Association Football was not formalised until 1863 and even then allowed handling of the ball but not catching it and running with it In the mid 1860s an attempt was made to provide one set of laws for all football but there were irreconcilable differences The hackers went on to eventually play rugby football even though hacking was barred a few years later while the anti hackers went on to form Association Football eventually banning any handling 

Rugby football is played on a field by two teams of 15 people The ball is slightly pointy at both ends At each end of the field there is a field goal made out of poles shaped like the letter H in English There is also an area called the in goal Players try to take the ball to the other teams in goal and place it on the ground If they do that they score a try They can also then try to score a goal To score a goal they have to kick the ball through the top of the H on the other teams side

To try and stop the other team scoring players try to tackle each other Tackling in rugby means that they try to grab the other person and stop them from moving or make them fall on the ground

There are two types of rugby called rugby union and rugby league The two types of rugby moved away from each other because they did not agree about the how players were treated when they were injured while playing a game Rugby union is played by more people than rugby league but many people play rugby league in the UK Australia New Zealand and Papua New Guinea In most other places the word rugby means rugby union

Every four years there is a championship of the rugby union teams from countries all over the world It is called the Rugby World Cup and the next Rugby World Cup will be in 2015 in England

There is also the Rugby League World Cup made up of member nations of the Rugby League International Federation The tournament has an irregular schedule The next tournament will be in 2013 hosted by the UK

Kidneys are two organs in the abdomen of vertebrates that are shaped like beans They make urine They are part of the urinary system When medical professionals discuss the kidneys they typically refer to the word renal For example renal failure is when the kidneys are sick and do not work 

The prefix nephro is also used in words to mean kidneys For example a nephrologist is a doctor who studies kidneys

The kidney makes hormones The two most important ones that it makes are erythropoetin and renin

Erythropoetin is made by the kidneys if there is less oxygen in the kidney Erythropoetin tells the bone marrow to make more red blood cells Red blood cells carry oxygen in the blood So this means there will be more oxygen carried in the blood

Renin is made by the kidney if there is low blood pressure low volume of blood or too low salts in the blood Renin tells the blood vessels to be smaller It tells the adrenal gland to make aldosterone It tells the body to drink more water All of this makes the blood pressure go up

The kidneys most important work is keeping homeostasis Homeostasis means that the body keeps a stable environment inside itself The body wants to have the consistent and proper amount of water salt and acid in the blood This makes the body work better The kidney keeps these things constant

If there is too much water the kidney puts more water in the urine If there is not enough water the kidney puts less water in the urine This is why people make less urine when they are dehydrated

There are many types of kidney diseases If kidney disease makes the kidneys not able to do but they do work in part People can have mild renal failure and have no symptoms As long as it does not become worse people may not even know they have it Severe renal failure means very bad failure The kidneys do not work very much at all People with severe renal failure always have symptoms They may need special care from doctors 

The main kinds of kidney diseases are

People who do not have good kidneys are very sick If they have severe renal failure they cannot live unless they have a replacement for their kidneys Replacement is something that takes the place of something else

There are two ways to replace the kidneys dialysis and transplantation

Dialysis is when doctors use a machine and medicines to do the work that kidneys do There are two kinds of dialysis hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis

Peritoneal dialysis is when doctors put a plastic tube into the persons abdomen Every day the person fills the abdomen with fluid The extra salts waste and water that the body does not need goes into the fluid Then the fluid comes out and takes the wastes with it This does part of the job that kidneys do

Hemodialysis is when doctors take blood from a person clean the blood with a special kind of filter called haemodialyser managed through a special machine and put it back in the person When the blood is cleaned water salts and wastes are taken out of it This must be done 2 4 times every week It takes 2 4 hours to do this each time

Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not perfect They do some of the work of the kidney but it is not as good as a real kidney So people who need dialysis are not as healthy They must take medicines also For example in kidney failure the kidneys do not make erythropoetin So doctors have to give people erythropoetin so they make enough red blood cells

A better way to do the kidneys work is to give the person another kidney This is called a renal transplant Kidney transplants are the most common organ transplant that happens It is more common because we have two kidneys but only need one kidney to live People who are alive can donate a kidney to another person With other organs the donor must be dead first

Even transplants are not the same as kidneys people were born with A person who gets a renal transplants must take strong medicines to stop their body from attacking the new kidney Sometimes after years the transplanted kidney stops working But sometimes a patient can get a new transplanted kidney after the first one stops working

A prefix is a part of a word or a word within a word It is put at the start of another word to make a different meaning It can also mean a number that is put in at the start to show which number something is in a group It is a type of affix

Strictly speaking these constructions do not use prefixes but make compound nouns

The following examples illustrate real prefixes

Often people want to use a prefix to mean not There are many prefixes that mean not

Other examples of prefixes

Scientists and doctors use prefixes in many words

Sometimes people make up words by adding a prefix These words are not in a dictionary But if people use these words enough sometimes they go into dictionaries For example we can make the word unsimple which splits up into not simple This is not a word in a dictionary

Compare to suffix Suffixes are letters put at the end of a word to change its meaning

The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization usually just called UNESCO is the United Nations agency made on 16 November 1945 in Paris that looks after

One of the things UNESCO does is to make a list of all the most important special interesting or beautiful places in the world This list is called UNESCO World Heritage Sites These places and buildings musnt be destroyed because they are important and that beautiful that the people in the future can enjoy this places These places are telling us a lot about the past The Uluru for example tells us a lot about the culture of Aborigines Most countries have at least one place on this list but some have many They include historical buildings or sites beautiful landscapes places that have scientific value or places that are very important to one culture UNESCO also promotes education for sustainable development for the future poeple

Human rights is the idea that all people should have rights These rights are seen as universal which means they are meant for everyone no matter what their race religion ethnicity nationality age sex political beliefs intelligence disability sexual orientation or gender identity are

The idea of human rights comes from ideas found in religion and philosophy in Western Europe The modern Western idea of human rights started in the European Enlightenment In the 16th century some people started suggesting that everyone had the religious and political right to choose their religion and their leaders This sort of thinking was important in the English Civil War After the war the philosopher John Locke argued that people should have these rights he was one of the first people to call them human rights These ideas were also important in the American revolution and the French revolution in the 18th century

In the 19th century John Stuart Mill was an important philosopher who thought about human rights He said that people should be able to control their own bodies and minds He talked about three special ideas

Hegel was a philosopher who talked about the idea of free will He also talked about what makes a person free that a person has to have certain relations with other people to have true freedom A person has to be able to

Because people believe that human rights are important countries make laws to protect them These laws say that governments cannot take away peoples basic rights They make sure people who take away other peoples rights are punished

Some major political organizations have made statements that promote human rights These are not laws but they affect us anyway If groups or countries do not follow these statements others will condemn them and then people may not talk with them do business with them or help them

Some of the important places that human rights laws are written is in constitutions The United States and Frances constitutions are two of the oldest set of laws based on human rights

In 1948 the United Nations made the Universal Declaration of Human Rights This is a widely respected document that says what the United Nations believes are human rights It is not a law but is the basis on which two important agreements are written

These are United Nations human rights Covenants agreements between people or countries The countries who sign these two covenants agree to follow them

In addition to those Declaration and Covenants there are many treaties and documents made by United Nations and other international organizations Those treaties and documents are called International human rights law

Not everyone agrees on what the basic human rights are Here is a list of some of the most recognized ones

Abuse means to intentionally harm a person or people physically mentally emotionally or verbally once or many times Human rights abuse follows along similarly also keeping in count the universal rights Human rights abuse happens when a person is hurt in a way that violates hisher human rights Human rights abuses are also often called human rights violations

Examples of human rights abuses or violations are

And many more

Many people groups and countries think protecting human rights is very important But not everyone in the world believes in human rights If people who do not believe in human rights have political power they can hurt many people Even if these people have no political power they can be violent to other people There are many people who work to protect everyones human rights some of these are government groups and some are not with any government They are sometimes called Human Rights Organizations

Some well known human rights groups are

Nationality means of what nation a person is a citizen

It is considered good by world governments to have citizens of different countries living together since this encourages multi culturalism This is a good thing because it can help avoid racism and intolerance

Race has many meanings in English It can mean

The term religious fundamentalism was used at first to describe some people in the Protestant community in the United States in the early 20th century These people had a set of well defined values These values were in opposition to more modern ideas The group also said it was important to stick to what faith told them Today the term is used more generally 

Religious fundamentalism is a new development in society People who study religious fundamentalism see it as a response to modern society Today society is not as simple as it was Today many people live in societies that can be hard to understand Changes in familiar things can make people feel unsafe So some people look in their religion to see something that does not change They also want rules about how to act that do not change So they see their religion as this thing that does not change

When people look at religion this way they see the ideas in the religion as absolute This means that it is not possible for them to change When religion is seen as absolute it becomes fundamentalism 

People can be any religion and be fundamentalists

Some people who are called religious fundamentalists do not like that name They do not like it because religious fundamentalist has some negative ideas about it Many people who are politically progressive or liberal sometimes do not like religious fundamentalists They believe bad things about them like that they are not clever they are not educated or that they do not respect peoples human rights Some people who are called religious fundamentalists do not like that the term has these other meanings So they do not want to be called religious fundamentalists

Some people who are Christian fundamentalists do like that term and use it to name themselves But they do not like being called religious fundamentalists because Islamic fundamentalists are in this same group

Not all religious fundamentalists believe the same things But there are many issues that they have strong beliefs about Some of these issues are similar even in different religions Some of these issues are

Medical ethics is the set of ethical rules that doctors follow These ideas tell doctors how they should treat patients

The earliest set of ethical ideas in medicine was the Hippocratic oath It was supposed to be written by Hippocrates but probably was not written by him

There are 6 major principles

Here are some kinds of medical ethics questions

Sperm are the male reproductive cells Most animals and plants use sperm to reproduce They have different ways of making and releasing the sperm In all cases the sperm meet with the egg of a female and grow into a new organism

The name sperm is taken from the Greek word sperma meaning seed

An animal sperm cell is capable of movement as it has to get to the uterus to meet with the ovum Animal sperm cells have small head and a long tail called a flagellum The flagellum acts like a motor to propel the sperm cell through the female reproductive system 

A plant sperm cell is non motive it can not move by itself Plant sperm cells are contained within the pollen of a plant They reach other plants through the wind or insects such as bees 

Human sperm is made in the testicles of a man Human sperm contains 23 chromosomes A human needs 46 chromosomes so a sperm cell is called a haploid as it only has half The other half is contained within the ovum or egg of a female During sex semen is shot out of the mans penis during ejaculation Semen carries the sperm into the womans vagina and down to the ovum in the uterus During ejaculation millions of sperm cells are released but only one hundred or so reach the egg The egg can merge with one sperm cell that reaches it Because it now has 46 chromosomes it is called a diploid like ordinary cells of the body This diploid is called a zygote and it can grow into a fetus and eventually a baby

Plant sperm cells cannot move by themselves Plant sperm cells are contained within a sticky liquid called pollen They rely on transportation to take their sperm cells to other plants For example a bee lands on a plant to collect the pollen Some pollen wil get stuck to the bee The bee moves on to another plant and the pollen falls onto that plant The pollen falls down a pollen tube until it reaches the ovule at the bottom

Semen is the fluid that comes out from the end of a mans penis when he has an orgasm and ejaculates It is usually a white or yellowish sticky substance made up of sperm floating in a fluid called seminal plasma that has water and different chemicals in it Normally an ejaculation makes between 15 and 5 millilitres of semen

Some scientists think that semen that is taken into a womans body causes her not to feel depressed or sad On the other hand if semen touches another persons body it can pass on sexually transmitted infections In a few cases it can also make the other persons immune system weaker or cause the person to have an allergic reaction The risks of these health problems happening can be reduced if the man wears a condom when having sex

Many cultures around the world once thought or still think that semen has special or even magical qualities Showing semen in forms of popular culture such as art and movies has for a long time been taboo that is not generally accepted by society However since the late 20th century artists and moviemakers have done so more often

The English word semen comes from the Latin word smen which means seed In fact seed was an old fashioned name for semen The Latin word smen itself came from another Latin word serre which means to plant or to sow It was once thought that semen was like a seed that grew into a baby after being planted inside a womans body

Another name for semen is ejaculate Some slang words for semen are cream cum jism jizz load spooge spunknut and wad

Semen is the fluid that comes out from the end of a mans penis when he has an orgasm and ejaculates It is usually white but may also be slightly grey or yellow If there is blood in the semen it can look pink or reddish This is a condition called hematospermia and may be because of some blockage inflammation infection or injury to some part of the male sex organs such as the urethra epididymis prostate or testicles A doctor should be seen if the pink or reddish colour does not go away after a few days

Men ejaculate different amounts of semen Normally an ejaculation makes between 15 and 5 millilitres of semen More semen usually comes out if a man has not ejaculated for many days or if he has been stimulated for a long time Older men make less semen If a man ejaculates an unusually small amount of semen this is a medical condition called hypospermia

After a man has ejaculated semen first becomes slightly thick and sticky and may feel a bit like jelly and clump together in globs Scientists think that semen does this so that if the man has had sex with a woman and has ejaculated inside her vagina the semen stays in her vagina for longer and does not leak out Between five and 40 minutes after this semen becomes more liquid and watery This probably allows the sperm in the semen to move through the vagina and into the womans uterus and Fallopian tubes to try and fertilize an ovum If semen is ejaculated outside the body after becoming watery it eventually dries up

Semen is made up of sperm floating in a fluid called seminal plasma Sperm also called spermatozoa are made by a mans testicles and mature in the epididymis The fluids in seminal plasma come from different glands in the mans body the seminal vesicles prostate and bulbourethral glands The table below shows the substances that make up semen and the glands that produce them

Seminal plasma protects and provides food for sperm as they travel inside a womans body The inside of a womana vagina does not suit sperm cells as it is acidic To protect the sperm from the acid seminal plasma is alkaline A womans immune system also tries to kill organisms that are not part of her body Seminal plasma has chemicals called prostaglandins in it to stop the womans body from killing the sperm

Semen that does not have any germs in it is not harmful if it is swallowed for example after a person has had oral sex with a man and the man ejaculates in that persons mouth

Semen quality refers to how well the sperm in a mans semen can fertilize a womans ova The better a mans semen quality is the better chances he has to make a woman pregnant A 1992 World Health Organization book said that an ejaculation of normal human semen has

The number of sperm in an ejaculation of semen depends on many things There may be more sperm if

If there are an unusually low number of sperm in an ejaculation this is called oligospermia If there are no sperm at all this is called azoospermia A man with oligospermia or azoospermia is usually infertile and cannot or finds it very hard to make a woman pregnant by having sex with her

Studies seem to say that semen is an anti depressant This means that it causes women not to feel depressed or sad The studies found that when men had sex with women without using condoms and the mens semen was taken into the womens vaginas the women had better moods and felt happier Scientists do not yet know if the same thing happens when semen is swallowed after oral sex but some of them think it may

If a man has a sexually transmitted infection or STI the germs that cause the disease can appear in his semen If the person that the man has sex with touches the semen he or she can become infected by the germs and pick up the disease AIDS chlamydia gonorrhea hepatitis B herpes and syphillis are examples of STIs One of the ways for a man to lower the chance of passing on an STI to his sexual partner is to wear a condom on his penis when having sex

Some scientists think that parts of semen such as sperm and seminal plasma can make another persons immune system weaker Experiments show that when substances in a mans semen enter another persons body that persons body makes antibodies Antibodies are large Y shaped proteins used by the bodys immune system to stop foreign objects from harming the body However the antibodies made in response to substances in semen attack one of the bodys own cells called T lymphocytes This weakens the bodys immune system

In a very small number of cases people have experienced allergic reactions when they touched semen This is called human seminal plasma hypersensitivity The symptoms can either be near the part of the body which touched the semen or all over the body They may include itching of the vagina redness swelling or blisters within 30 minutes of contact They may also include itching and hives all over the body and even difficulty breathing

The best way to test for human seminal plasma hypersensitivity is for a man to use a condom when having sex When a condom is used after ejaculation the mans semen stays inside the condom and does not touch the body of the person he is having sex with If the mans sexual partner usually has allergic symptoms to semen but does not have any when a condom is used this may show that his partners body is extra sensitive to semen A person can often get over a mild semen allergy by coming into contact with semen often If the allergic reaction is very bad the person should see a doctor especially if she is a woman trying to get pregnant In such cases it may be necessary for the woman to have a baby through artificial insemination This is a medical way of fertilizing a womans ova using a mans sperm without the man and the woman having sexual intercourse

In the United States middle school is a school between elementary school and high school Depending on location middle school contains grades 6 8 7 8 or 7 9 Middle school is also sometimes called junior high school or just junior high

The school day is often very different in elementary middle and high schools Unlike elementary schools where students often stay with one or two teachers for most of the school day middle school is usually the first time in which students change teachers after each class of usually about one hour Students often study 6 to 8 subjects They will be taught by a different teacher for each subject This is also the first year they must dress out or change clothes for PE

The change from a one teacher all subjects way of teaching helps create more independence for the pupil They no longer have the guidance of just one main teacher Also students will often have more of a choice in what classes they take This is mainly in dealing with subjects which are taken in addition the basic subjects such as mathematics English history and general science

In general middle school acts as a transition between the elementary school structure where most people are all treated the same and the high school structure were most people are treated as individuals However some critics see middle schools as having gone soft overemphasizing self esteem building at the expense of academic rigor

The Ku Klux Klan is a hate group which was started in the southern United States in 3rd March 1865 Most of its hate has been towards African Americans but it has also attacked Catholics Jews and immigrants It has sought to keep something called white power often through very violent acts such as killing people The first Ku Klux Klan broken wikt linkdisbanddisbanded and does not exist anymore However other groups with the same name and many of the same ideas have been created 

The Ku Klux Klan is an organization which was created in the South of the United States in 1865 This was after the American Civil War It was made to protest against the new government During this time there were troops based in the ex Confederacy states The Klan was scared that the population in the South could lose their democratic rights Also the Klan members believed that African Americans were inferior to white people The Klan acted against black people Republicans were also targets of attacks by the klan The methods of acting against people were often the same the Klan members tried to frighten the people that the Klan wanted to go out of town The KKK tried to scare people by burning crosses or by threatening them If people did not react the Klan killed them The growing violence which was celebrated by the KKK led to many lynchingsThe Klan was a large problem The KKK was prohibited in 1871 After 1871 many KKK members were imprisoned However the Klan had achieved many of its original goals For example the troops were moved out of the Southern states to the Middle West

In 1915 William J Simmons started the Ku Klux Klan for a second time Most of the rituals and traditions of the old Ku Klux Klan were kept Any white Protestant man could join the KKK The KKK still attacked African Americans but they also attacked Jews and Catholics this time In 1920 growing economic problems caused the Klan to get much bigger The KKK strongly argued for white supremacy again and again White supremacy says that people who are white are better than other racial groups The Klan killed many blacks These were not legal executions because there were no trials Many sources now think these acts were a kind of terrorism because the KKK used fear to control African Americans and take away their human rights In the middle of the 20s the Klan got smaller due to bad leaders and so much violence After the Second World War the Klan closed again because it owed more money than it could pay 

In 1954 the United States Supreme Court made an important decision The case was Brown v Board of Education of Topeka Kansas The court ruled that it was un Constitutional to have different schools for black and white children When this ruling passed many independent groups using the Ku Klux Klan name attacked African Americans

In the summer of 1964 Edgar Killen killed three African Americans that participated in the civil rights movement Killen was a member of the Ku Klux Klan There was an early trial in 1967 but in this trial there was an all white jury and so Killen was set free In 1988 a movie called Mississippi Burning was made which talked about the events of this case In 2005 there was another trial Killen was sentenced to prison for 160 years

Today there may be about 5000 members

Brown versus Board of Education was an important law case in the United States This case was decided by the Supreme Court of the United States which is the highest court in the US

In Topeka Kansas a black third grader girl named Linda Brown had to walk more than a mile through a railroad switchyard to get to her black school even though there was a white elementary school less than seven blocks away Her father tried to get her into the white school but the principal of the school refused Twelve more black parents joined Oliver Brown Lindas father in trying to get their children into the white elementary school Even though it was said that the two schools were both equal this was not true As the principal refused to allow their children into his school a legal case was made The case won and it was made illegal for there to be separate schools for blacks and white even though some states at first refused This case was supported by NAACP

The Supreme Court has nine justices The vote on Brown v Board of Education was unanimous meaning that all nine justices voted the same way The ruling in the case was written by Earl Warren who was Chief Justice He said separate educational facilities are inherently unequal This undid an earlier decision called Plessy v Ferguson which said that separate but equal was acceptable This decision made racial segregation of schools against the law in every US state Some states resisted this court decision at first It was not until the early 1970s that all US public schools were integrated

A well is a hole that is dug into the Earth to get water Wells can be as simple as a hole that a bucket on a rope can be lowered into or very complex with pipes and high powered pumps to get the water out Most cities that are not located close to fresh water lakes or rivers get their water from a well

It is important to be careful what rubbish is put into the ground near a well If something toxic is put in the ground it could end up in the water from the well and make people sick

Water is a problem for many African countries Many charities are helping to build wells in local villages to help stop lengthy travel to distant water supply

Surgery is an operation that involves a doctor The doctor helps his patients by taking out changing or fixing parts of the human body Doctors who do surgeries are called surgeons Many surgeons are experts in certain areas for example a surgeon that operates on bones is called an orthopaedic surgeon

Surgery can be very simple like taking a tooth out Surgery can also be very complicated like surgery to remove a cancer

Operating rooms have to be very clean places The doctors and nurses go to great lengths to keep the room clean where the surgery is done Regular cleaning of the room and its tools is done to keep everything clean and germ free

Everyone in the operating room must wear special clothes hats shoes gowns gloves and masks that are clean and germ free The only people allowed in the operating rooms are the doctors and nurses as well as the patient too

When people have operations they are normally put to sleep with anaesthesia When the patients are asleep they cannot feel anything

In recent years many patients that cannot get the required surgery in their own country or find the costs too high travel to another country for medical care This is called Medical Tourism

Pizza is a type of food that was created in Italy It is usually made by putting toppings over a piece of bread covered with sauce most often tomato but sometimes butter based sauces are used Almost any kind of topping can be put over a pizza The toppings people use are different in different parts of the world Pizza comes from Italy from Neapolitan cuisine but has become popular in many parts of the world

As Italians emigrated after World War I pizza became an international dish

In the 20th century pizza has become an international food and the toppings may be quite different in accordance with local tastes These pizzas consist of the same basic design but include many choice of ingredients such as anchovies egg pineapple banana coconut sauerkraut eggplant kimchi lamb couscous chicken fish and shellfish meats prepared in styles such as Moroccan lamb shawarma or chicken tikka masala and non traditional spices such as curry and Thai sweet chili Pizzas can also be made without meat for vegetarians and without cheese for vegans

A button can have three meanings

Multiprocessing is the use of two or more central processing units within a single computer system The CPUs do not have to be the same Systems that treat all CPUs equally are called symmetric multiprocessing systems

Multitasking means that a computer can run more than one item of software at the same time It can also refer to a person who is working on more than one task at the same time

Computers with only one Central Processing Unit can only appear to run more than one program Computer scientists solve the problem that a CPU can only do one thing at a time by programming it so that it switches rapidly between tasks This happens so rapidly that it appears that the computer is running more than one program at once This action is often controlled by the Operating System controlling the hardware of the system

The more things the computer has to do at once the more time it has to spend deciding which to give more time to and the less time each one receives This tends to make the computer perform its tasks more slowly unless it uses a multi core processor

Multithreading means that a computer can work on different parts of the same program at the same time This usually allows the program to run faster

Fertilization is what happens when a females ovum joins together with a males sperm and they form a zygote Fertilization is also called conception

Because testicular cancer is curable when detected early experts recommend regular monthly testicular self examination after a hot shower or bath when the scrotum is looser Men are advised to feel each testicle feeling for pea shaped lumps Symptoms of testicular cancer include one or more of the following

How bad the cancer is and whether it is present at all is often discovered through ultrasound of the testicles x rays andor CT scans Blood tests are also used to identify and measure tumour markers that are only in a persons blood if they have testicular cancer Biopsies should not be performed because it increases the risk of migrating cancer cells into the scrotum

The future is something that has not happened yet Once that something has happened it is called the past If it is happening now it is called the present

Particles are tiny bits of matter that make up everything in the universe In particle physics an elementary particle is a particle which cannot be split up into smaller pieces 

There are many different types of particles all with different sizes and properties 

Three particles which are all around us are the proton the neutron and the electron These are the particles which make atoms The proton has a positive charge The neutron has a neutral charge The electron has a negative charge and it is the smallest of these three particles In atoms there is a small nucleus in the center which is where the protons and neutrons are and electrons orbit the nucleus

Protons and neutrons are not elementary particles because they are made up of quarks There are six different types of quarks These are the up quark the down quark the strange quark the charm quark the bottom quark and the top quark A neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark The proton is made up of two up quarks and one down quark

Menstruation or menses is when a girl has blood come out of her vagina for 2 7 days every month A slang word for menses is a period or dot

Before women begin their menses there is cloudy white liquid like fluid that comes out of the vaginal wall and eventually leaks on to their underwear A girl begins this cycle about a year before the actual menstruating happens When the liquid turns a deep brownish colour the leaking starts to become often After the leaking stops which is within a year of it first happening then she begins to menstruate for 3 5 days Once the experience becomes normal and adjusts to the body function then she will leak about 2 7 days

Most women menstruate for 3 5 days every month However anywhere from 2 7 days is normal The amount of blood lost is normally about 50ml Women usually use a pad or a tampon to keep the blood from staining their undergarments

Menopause is menstruation pausing at the age of around 45 70 Symptoms include irritability heat vaginal burning andor discomfort vaginal dryness A slang word for it is called the change Most women must take a few months to adjust to the dryness After they stop their period they can no longer produce babies

The fluid that comes out looks like blood but it is more than just blood It also has endometrial tissue This is the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus

Menses happens in the first days of the menstrual cycle This is the changes that happen in a womans body every month These changes are started by changes in hormone levels in the blood These changes also cause a woman to ovulate and make an ovum Menstruation usually starts around the age of 11 even as early as 9 years old and ends when the woman is too old to have children However some women can still have children from the age of 50 70

Some women have pain in the low part of the abdomen when they menstruate known as cramps The hormones that are produced before and during a period can also make a woman feel moody or just strange This is called premenstrual syndrome or PMS A women can feel bloated or swollen and have long cramps Hormones can rage and cause an aggressive sex drive Women can throw temper tantrums and can even feel suicidal or depressed

Most women use something to absorb or catch their menses There are a number of different methods available The most common used way to absorb the menses is using sanitary napkins tampons and padded underwear Some women use sea sponges towels and other reusable absorbing items

In addition to products to contain the menstrual flow pharmaceutical companies likewise provide products commonly non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs to relieve menstrual cramps Some herbs such as dong quai raspberry leaf and crampbark are also claimed to relieve menstrual pain however there is no documented scientific evidence

Period means different things

A nightclub is a type of bar or club for men and women to socialize and meet other adults and consume alcoholic drinks such as wine beer and mixed drinks Most nightclubs are only open in the evening and in the night Some nightclubs are open during the day but in these cases the facility usually provides a different service such as a restaurant service

Some nightclubs have a dance floor and a DJ playing pop rock and dance music recordings so that people can dance Some nightclubs have entertainment such as pop bands rock bands or comedians Some nightclubs have a quieter lounge area with couches sofas and low tables so that people can talk together

Some nightclubs also serve a small selection of food usually snacks or finger food Nightclubs often have a much wider selection of alcoholic drinks than pubs Most nightclubs sell a number of different brands of spirits liquers wine sherry Some nightclubs have a large selection of expensive brands of alcohol

The bartenders at nightclubs often make a much larger variety of mixed drinks than pubs Mixed drinks and cocktails are alcoholic drinks that consist of one or more types of alcohol mixed with flavorings such as orange juice cream chocolate syrup or soda Many mixed drinks also include ice crushed ice or sliced lemon or lime 

Some well known mixed drinks include the martini the Rum and Coke and the screwdriver

Nightclubs hire a variety of staff to do different jobs Bartenders at nightclubs serve alcohol and mix drinks Some nightclubs hire servers to bring drinks to people who are sitting at tables or in chairs Some nightclubs also hire people to take away empty bottles and glasses 

Security in nightclubs is provided by door staff often called bouncers Door staff check the identification of people entering the nightclub to ensure that people that are too young to drink do not enter the club Door staff also prevent drunk or aggressive people from entering the nightclub They also escort people out of the club if they are too drunk fighting or taking drugs Door staff may also call the police if they cannot deal with a situation

Nightclubs that serve food have cooks dishwashers and servers to prepare cook and serve the food Nightclubs also have coat check employees who hang up the patrons coats sound technicians to maintain the sound system and cleaners Some large nightclubs may hire DJs to work in the club every week as employees 

Freezing is the process when a liquid turns into a solid Freezing occurs when heat is lost from an object which causes the molecules to slow down and form tighter bonds basically in short terms freezing is when lets say water turns into ice Freezing is the opposite of melting and two steps away from evaporation 

A precious metal is a type of metal that is worth a lot of money compared to most other metals Some precious metals are gold silver and platinum Many pieces of jewelry are made out of precious metals

The precious metal worth the most amount of money for the same mass is Rhodium

Jewellery refers to any clothing accessory that is worn as a decoration Jewellery differs from other items of personal adornment in that it has no other purpose than to look attractive Items such as belts and handbags are considered to be accessories rather than jewellery Yet some jewellery does have some practical effect a broach for example was often worn to keep a cloak closed

Humans have made jewelry for a long time There are many forms of jewelry worn for traditional social or religious reasons Jewelry can come in many forms worn on any part of the body or clothing Jewelry most often are rings chains bead strings pendants and piercings worn around or on different body parts

Jewelry can be made from any material The first jewelry was made from bone animal teeth wood or stone Jewelry often uses gemstones and precious metals

Fashion jewelry or Costume jewelry is jewelry that is worn just for fashion and is not made of expensive materials

Potassium is a chemical element in the periodic table It has the symbol K This symbol is taken from the Latin word kalium Potassiums atomic number is 19 It has 19 protons and electrons Potassium is not found as an element in nature because it is so reactive

Potassium has two stable isotopes with 20 or 22 neutrons Its atomic mass is 39098 

Potassium is a soft gray metal It can be cut easily with a knife Its melting point is 63 degrees celsius It melts at a very low temperature It is an alkali metal It is the second lightest metal after lithium 

Potassium reacts in many chemical reactions similar to sodium and other alkali metals It tarnishes in air to produce a whitish oxidized layer on the surface This is why it is stored in oil It also reacts very fast with water which is another reason for its storage in oil The hydrogen produced during its reaction with water can burst into flames when a large amount of potassium is added to water Potassium hydroxide is also produced Potassium also burns in air easily to make the peroxide or the superoxide

Potassium compounds are only in one oxidation state 1 Potassium ions are colorless and similar to sodium ions Potassium chloride can be used as a substitute for table salt Potassium hydroxide is used in the electrolyte of alkaline cells Most potassium compounds are nontoxic If they are toxic it is because of the anion Potassium chromate is colored because of the chromate not the potassium Potassium chromate is toxic because of the chromate not the potassium

 FilePotassium hydroxidejpgPotassium hydroxide FileKClO3jpgPotassium chlorate FilePotassium chloridejpgPotassium chloride FilePotassium chromate samplejpgPotassium chromate 

The word potassium comes from the word potash Potash is a chemical that is a mixture of potassium carbonate and potassium hydroxide that has been used for a very long time It is used to make fertilizer soap and glass

Potassium does not occur in nature because it is too reactive It is found in minerals though It is extracted from them by electrolysis of potassium hydroxide or potassium chloride The potassium hydroxide or potassium chloride has to be melted at a very high temperature

It is used to absorb water from solvents It is also used in some scientific instruments

Main article Potassium compounds

Potassium compounds are used in soap fertilizer explosives and matches

Potassium ions are very important to organisms They send messages from cells to other cells It helps biological membranes depolarize This means go from a negative to a positive electrical charge This is needed for muscles to contract It is needed for the heart to beat If the potassium level in the blood is too high or too low it can cause death because the heart stops A few good sources of potassium are bananas apricots and raisins

Potassium metal is very dangerous and can form an explosive coating if it is kept in air It also reacts violently with water spewing corrosive liquid all over Potassium compounds are not normally dangerous unless they contain a toxic anion like chromate or chlorate

The Simpsons is an American television programme that is an animated comedy created by Matt Groening The comedy takes place in the fake town of Springfield It started on December 17 1989 and so far 486 episodes have aired over 22 seasons As of today the show is in its 23rd season which will air in 2011 2012 The end of the 18th season was the 400th episode A full length movie The Simpsons Movie has been made released on July 27 2007 in order to celebrate The Simpsons franchise

The television show The Simpsons was originally shown as short shows on The Tracy Ullman Show Fox then decided to give them their own show in 1989

Many episodes begin with a scene of Springfield Elementary School where Bart Simpson is shown writing lines on a chalkboard as punishment for being bad For example in one episode Bart writes I will not conduct my own fire drills The line is supposed to be humourous Not every episode has a new one and sometimes the chalkboard gag may be cut because there is not enough time

In the opening all the Simpsons come home to the family After Homer Simpson is almost or is hit by Marges car they all go into the living room where something comical happens again These are called couch gags On one couch gag Homer Simpson walked onto the screen like James Bond and shot the camera Sometimes if an episode is a short one then the couch gag will be very long A couple of couch gags have been over one minute long

At the end of the show the credits are shown Sometimes they might be changed In one episode the ending showed Homer reading from a document about Dateline In another episode where all of the character sung in song the character Snake kept firing his gun in order to make the music that was playing stop

A film based on the show The Simpsons Movie was released in 2007

A museum is a building where things are collected and then shown to people Some museums have things that you can do Museums can be about different things such as Natural History Science or Art Museums with live animals are called zoos People go to museums sometimes to learn or to simply have fun 

A camera is a device that takes pictures It uses film or electronics to make a picture of something A lens makes the image that the film or electronics sees

A camera that takes one picture at a time is sometimes called a still camera A camera that can take many pictures in a row is called a movie camera A camera that can take videos is called a video camera or a camcorder A Camera on a phone is called a Camera Phone

All cameras are basically a box that light can not get into until a photo is taken There is a hole on one side of the camera where the light can get in and this is called the aperture On the other side is a special material that can record the image that comes through the aperture this material is the film in a film camera or electronic sensor in a digital camera Finally there is also the shutter which stops light from getting in until a photo is taken

When a photo is taken the shutter moves out of the way This lets light come in through the aperture and make a picture on the film or electronic sensor In many cameras the size of the aperture can be changed to let in more light or less light The amount of time that the shutter lets light through can be changed as well This also lets in more light or less light Most of the time electronics inside the camera control these but in some cameras the person taking the picture can change them as well

Westminster Abbey is a large and famous Anglican church in Westminster London It is the shrine of Edward the Confessor and the burial place of many kings and queens Since it was built it has been the place where the coronations of Kings and Queens of England have been held The present structure dates from 1245 when it was started by Henry III

The status of the Abbey is that of a Royal Peculiar This means it is place of worship that falls directly under the jurisdiction of the British monarch rather than under a bishop The concept dates from Anglo Saxon times when a church could ally itself with the monarch and therefore not be subject to the bishop of the area Technically speaking it is not a cathedral though it is regarded as one in practice

One of the most famous tombs at Westminster Abbey is that of the Unknown Warrior

Since the coronations in 1066 of both King Harold and William the Conqueror coronations of English and British monarchs were held in the Abbey Henry III was unable to be crowned in London when he first came to the throne because the French prince Louis had taken control of the city So the king was crowned in Gloucester Cathedral but this coronation was deemed by the Pope to be improper and a further coronation was held in the Abbey on 17 May 1220 The Archbishop of Canterbury is the cleric in the coronation ceremony

King Edwards Chair is the throne on which British sovereigns sit when the crown is put on their heads It is kept in the Abbey and has been used at every coronation since 1308 From 1301 to 1996 the chair also housed the Stone of Scone upon which the kings of Scotland are crowned Although the Stone is now kept in Scotland at future coronations the Stone will be returned briefy to St Edwards Chair for the moment of coronation

Until the 19th century Westminster was the third seat of learning in England after Oxford and Cambridge It was here that the first third of the King James Bible Old Testament and the last half of the New Testament were translated The New English Bible was also put together here in the 20th century

 Noteworthy 

The Himalayas are a mountain range in Asia the highest in the world 

They are north within Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir into the Republic of Indias Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal states State of Nepal and the Kingdoms of Sikkim and Bhutan then into South Tibet 

The 15 highest mountains in the world are in the Himalayas The main ones are the Mount Everest K2 Annapurna and Nanga Parbat Mount Everest is the tallest mountain on the face of the Earth Mount Everest is 8849 meters There are over 100 mountains and the base is 20643 ft above sea level Of the fifteen highest mountain peaks in the World nine of them are contained within the Nepal Himalayas

The word Himalaya means House of Snow in Sanskrit an old Indian language The Himalayas are so high that they kept the Indian and Chinese people separate from each other most of the time In fact India is a peninsula that is cut off from the rest of Asia by the mountains India is often called a sub continent because it has water on three sides and mountains on the fourth 

North of the Himalayas is the Tibetan Plateau It is called the roof of the world However the Tibetan Plateau is very dry because the plateau and the mountains act as a gigantic rain shadow

Geologically the origin of the Himalayas is the impact of the Indian tectonic plate This travels northward at 15 cm per year and joined the Eurasian continent about 40 50 million years ago The formation of the Himalayas resulted in the lighter rock of the seabeds of that time being lifted up into mountains An often cited fact used to illustrate this process is that the summit of Mount Everest is made of marine limestone

The Indian plate is still moving north at 67 mm per year Over the next 10 million years it will travel about 1500 km into Asia About 20 mm per year of the India Asia convergence is absorbed by thrusting along the Himalaya southern front This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5 mm per year making them geologically active The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also leads to earthquakes from time to time

The Himalayas is very popular for tourists because it has a lot of wild life The types of plants and trees which are common in the place are Oak Pine Fir Rhododendron Birch Juniper and Deodar Common animals which are seen mostly in the different parts of the Himalayas are snow leopard blue sheep musk deer tigers elephants wild boar and crocodiles Even endangered species of animals and plants are also able to find there In the north part of the Himalayas where the temperature falls below freezing point animals cannot survive well However those who adapted can survive During the cold winters most of the animals migrate to the lower regions of the Himalayas while others like the brown bear hibernate instead The Yak is mostly seen in the cold desert They are like wild ox and they are the largest animals in this region In regions of Ladakh animals like Nyan the wild and the most largest sheep are found

Some of the major places for wildlife attractions in the Himalayas are

The five main rivers of the Himalayas are the Jhelum Chenab Ravi Beas and Sutlej The rivers are the main source of human and animal life in those areas

The river Jhelum came from a spring called Verinag which is 80 km south of Srinagar It is known world wide for its nine bridges It is a very wide river and the water is quite muddy and dirty due to pollution etc

The two rivers Chandra and Bhaga come together to form the Chenab River The Chenab is in the Lahaul region of Himachal Pradesh It came from the melted snow that was on the foot of the main range of Himalaya in the Spiti and Lahaul district The lake of Chandra Tal also comes from these rivers

This river has come out in many love legends The town of Chamba is on a mountain shelf on the right bank of the river The region is famous for handicrafts like embroidered handkerchiefs silver and leather craft and woodcarving

The valley of Kullu and Kangra is formed by river Beas The main force of this river is from the south of Larji There it enters the Mandi district and further still into Kangra Its water increases to a great extent during the monsoon season so much so that it causes floods in the villages around it The Pong Dam is made on the river to get hydroelectric power supply

River Sutlej comes from the southern slopes of the mountain Kailash near the lake of Mansarovar It flows parallel to the Himalayas and in the end goes to the Shipki pass It cuts through the Zanskar range and makes a deep well part at the base of the Kinner Kailash

The Ramones were an American punk rock group who formed in New York City in 1974 and broke up in 1996 All the members of the group had stage names which replaced their real last names with Ramone They were one of the first punk bands Some others were The Clash The Sex Pistols and The Damned Three of the four founding members of the Ramones died within eight years of the band breaking up

The original lineup was made up of Joey on drums Johnny on guitar and Dee Dee on bass and vocals Tommy was their manager Then Dee Dee said he was unable to sing while playing bass so Tommy got Joey to sing and then played drums himself leaving Dee Dee to backup sing 

Their first album Ramones is now a classic of early punk rock The songs are short the melodies simple and the text is often made up of 2 or three phrases only Their live concerts were legendary extremely loud and very short They played song after song only interrupted by Dee Dees one two three

The Ramones never had big commercial success Now they are seen as one of the most important punk rock bands Bands like Nirvana or Green Day were influenced by the Ramones

Turtles are the reptile order Testudines They have a special bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs that acts as a shield 

The order Testudines includes both living and extinct species The earliest fossil turtles date from about 220 million years ago So turtles are one of the oldest surviving reptile groups and a more ancient group than lizards snakes and crocodiles 

Turtle have been very successful and have an almost world wide distribution But of the many species alive today some are highly endangered

Although the word turtle is widely used to describe all members of the order Testudines it is also common to see certain members described as terrapins tortoises or sea turtles as well How these names are used if at all depends on the type of English

To avoid confusion the word chelonian is popular among some who work with these animals as a catch all name Unfortunately Chelonia is the name of a particular genus of turtles so this conflicts with its use as a general catch all term for the order Testudines

Although many turtles spend much of their lives underwater all turtles and tortoises breathe air and must surface at regular intervals to refill their lungs They can also spend much of their lives on dry land 

Aquatic respiration in Australian freshwater turtles is being studied Some species have large cloacal cavities that are lined with many finger like projections These projections called papillae have a rich blood supply and increase the surface area The turtles can take up dissolved oxygen from the water using these papillae in much the same way that fish use gills to respire

Turtles lay eggs like other reptiles which are slightly soft and leathery The eggs of the largest species are spherical while the eggs of the rest are elongated Sea turtles lay their eggs on dry sandy beaches Turtles can take many years to reach breeding age and in many cases breed every few years rather than annually 

In some species there is temperature dependent sex determination Temperature determines whether an egg develops into a male or a female a higher temperature causes a female a lower temperature causes a male Large numbers of eggs are deposited in holes dug into mud or sand They are then covered and left to incubate by themselves When the turtles hatch they squirm their way to the surface and head toward the water No turtle mother cares for its young

Researchers have recently discovered a turtles organs do not gradually break down or become less efficient over time unlike most other animals It was found that the liver lungs and kidneys of a centenarian turtle are almost identical with that of its young counterpart This has inspired genetic researchers to begin examining the turtle genome for longevity genes

Turtles are divided into two groups according to how they evolved a solution to the problem of withdrawing their necks into their shells the Cryptodira which can draw their necks in while contracting it under their spine and the Pleurodira which contract their necks to the side This important adaptation evolved twice from ancestral turtles which did not have this ability

Turtles have a hard beak Turtles use their jaws to cut and chew food Instead of teeth the upper and lower jaws of the turtle are covered by horny ridges Carnivorous turtles usually have knife sharp ridges for slicing through their prey Herbivorous turtles have serrated edged ridges that help them cut through tough plants Turtles use their tongues to swallow food but they cannot unlike most reptiles stick out their tongues to catch food

The upper shell of the turtle is called the carapace The lower shell that encases the belly is called the plastron The carapace and plastron are joined together on the turtles sides by bony structures called bridges 

The inner layer of a turtles shell is made up of about 60 bones It include parts of the backbone and the ribs meaning the turtle cannot crawl out of its shell In most turtles the outer layer of the shell is covered by horny scales called scutes that are part of its outer skin or epidermis Scutes are made up of a fibrous protein called keratin that also makes up the scales of other reptiles These scutes overlap the seams between the shell bones and add strength to the shell Some turtles do not have horny scutes For example the leatherback sea turtle and the soft shelled turtles have shells covered with leathery skin instead

The largest chelonian is a marine turtle the great leatherback sea turtle which reaches a shell length of 200 cm and can reach a weight of over 900 kg Freshwater turtles are generally smaller but with the largest species the Asian softshell turtle Pelochelys cantorii a few individuals have been reported to measure up to 200 cm or 80 in This dwarfs even the better known alligator snapping turtle the largest chelonian in North America which attains a shell length of up to 80 cm and a weight of about 60 kg

The lagest fossil turtle Archelon was more than twice the length of the leatherback at up to 45 metres

The first fossil proto turtles come from Upper Triassic of the Mesozoic era about 220 million years ago Their shell evolved from bony extensions of their backbones and broad ribs that expanded and grew together to form a complete shell It offered protection at every stage of its evolution even when the bony component of the shell was not complete This proved a long lasting adaptation and the group as a whole has survived many changes in the seas and several extinction events

Fossils of the freshwater Odontochelys semitestacea or half shelled turtle with teeth from the later Triassic have been found in southwest China Odontochelys displays a complete bony plastron and an incomplete carapace similar to an early stage of turtle embryonic development By the Upper Jurassic turtles had radiated widely and their fossil history becomes easier to read

Their exact ancestry has been a puzzle Early amniotes had no openings in the skull behind the eyes Openings developed in both Sauropsid and Synapsid skulls They made the skull lighter gave attachment points for muscles and gave room for muscle bulges But turtles do not have these skull openings They were called anapsids meaning no openings

Eventually it was suggested that turtles evolved from sauropsids which had skull openings but turtles lost them as part of their evolution towards heavy defensive armour All molecular studies have strongly upheld the placement of turtles within diapsids some place turtles within Archosauria or as a sister group to extant archosaurs

The earliest known fully shelled turtles are the late Triassic Odontochelys Chinlechelys and Proganochelys The first named genus was aquatic but the second was probably terrestrial They already had many advanced turtle traits and thus probably had many millions of years of preceding turtle evolution and species in its ancestry They did lack the ability to pull their heads into their shell and had a long spiked tail ending in a club a body form similar to that of ankylosaurs resulting from convergent evolution

Turtles are divided into two extant suborders the Cryptodira and the Pleurodira The Cryptodira is the larger of the two groups and includes all the marine turtles the terrestrial tortoises and many of the freshwater turtles The Pleurodira are sometimes known as the side necked turtles a reference to the way they withdraw their heads into their shells This smaller group consists primarily of various freshwater turtles

Rage Against the Machine sometimes known as RATM or Rage is a rock band from Los Angeles California Rage Against the Machine are known for their mixing of funk hip hop metal and rock music as well as their openly left wing politics The band members have been the same since they started in 1991 The band members are rapper Zack de la Rocha guitarist Tom Morello bass player Tim Commerford and drummer Brad Wilk Morello Commerford and Wilk were also in Audioslave with Chris Cornell

RATM released their debut album in 1992 It was called Rage Against the Machine The album sold a lot of copies and reached number 40 on the Billboard top 200 music chart The band did not do another album until Evil Empire in 1996 The bands third album The Battle of Los Angeles was released in 1999 and shortly after in 2000 the band released a covers album Renegades

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a declaration by the United Nations General Assembly It talks about basic human rights  rights that all people have just because they are human It was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10 1948

The UDHR is translated into over 300 languages This is more languages than any other document according to the Guinness Book of World Records

The UDHR may be broken into 30 parts or articles Each article says one idea about human rights Most people think these are the most important ideas

The UNHDR has been criticised by different people Mainly Islamic countries have pointed out that its understanding is mainly that of Christians or Jews Muslims could not implement certain parts of the declaration without trespassing islamic law On 30 June 2000 Muslim nations that are members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference officially resolved to support the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam an alternative document that says people have freedom and right to a dignified life in accordance with the Islamic Shariah

Certain Libertarians have stated that some of the positive rights must be implemented by force Few people will study for years to become a doctor if they cannot charge a fee for treating patients but that patients expect to be treated for free

Dolphins are mammals from the order of Cetacea the Whales They are animals that usually live in salt water like the sea but certain species can live in rivers

The name dolphin is used for oceanic dolphins and river dolphins but oceanic dolphins and river dolphins are not directly related

Their name dolphin comes from the Ancient Greek meaning with a womb because it was first thought to be a fish with a womb It is now known to be very different from fish because it breathes air and has warm blood like all other mammals They are believed to be almost as smart as a human

Dolphins swim in broken wikt linkpodpods a very large pod is called a herd They are very social and help one other fight off predators Dolphins have fought off sharks in this way They can kill large sharks by broken wikt linkramramming them over and over again with their pointed beaks and melons They even babysit for the mothers that need to leave their calves to hunt for food

Oceanic dolphins are marine animals living in the sea They live in all of the oceans

Three of the four species of river dolphins live in fresh water rivers The La Plata Dolphin lives in saltwater estuaries and the ocean

Water pollution and the loss of habitat are a threat to some dolphins especially those living in rivers and estuaries

People love dolphins because they are playful intelligent and seem to be smiling Many stories told in both ancient and recent history talk about dolphins saving people from drowning at sea and bringing them safely to shore Scientists are not sure whether dolphins do this because they actually want to save a person or because of instinct

Scientists think dolphins save drowning people by instinct because if a dolphin behaves like it might be drowning another dolphin will push it up to the surface of the water so it can breathe An injured dolphin is helped onto the back of another dolphin and carried to broken wikt linkshallowshallow waters where it is able to breathe and recover Since dolphins do this to their drowning dolphin friends it would seem natural that they would know how to save a drowning person as well

Some examples

The brain of a dolphin is like a human brain in size and development Dolphins have good eyesight They can watch a thing in the water and they can see colors too They can also see in dark places Dolphins breathe air A dolphins nose is on top of its head so the dolphin can easily breathe on the surface of the water A dolphins hearing is better than their sight There are some small holes behind the eyes and they are the ears of a dolphin Dolphins can hear a sound underwater They can know the direction of the sound very well The skin of a dolphin has no scales It is soft and smooth However it is very firm due to how much muscle they have Dolphins use echolocation to find their food 

Dolphins do not sleep in a normal way They have two sides of their brain which they use to sleep One side sleeps while the other side stays awake They will keep one eye open to watch for predators while they sleep

The domestic pig is a farm animal Baby pigs are called piglets Pigs can be eaten for food as pork ham and bacon The Jewish and Muslim religions and some Christian denominations teach that eating pork is wrong

They are often pink but small pigs kept as pets are often other colors Pigs often roll in mud to protect themselves from sunlight Many people think that pigs are dirty and smell In fact they roll around in the mud to keep parasitic animals away from their skin This also helps to keep their skin moist and lower their body temperature on hot days They are omnivores which means they eat anything that comes in their way Because their eyes are on the sides of their heads pigs cannot look up to the sky

Pigs are very intelligent animals They can be taught to dance race pull carts and sniff out landmines They can even be taught to play video games

Pigs need a warm clean area under a roof to sleep and they shouldnt be too crowded They need to be checked for sickness regularly Stress can make them get sick more easily

Pigs need lots of water Over half their body weight is made up of water Pigs should be given all the feed they will eat which is usually 4 to 5 pounds a day for adult pigs Corn is a good food for pigs but they should also have protein supplements as well

Pigs are often found on farms throughout the world and can be popular pets A new breed of micro pigs has become very popular but often piglets are misold as micro pigs and then grow to be too big In places pigs are mass farmed to produce the best animal for meat These meat farms are often overcrowded with pigs and conditions are really bad

Wheat is a kind of plant Its seeds are a type of cereal grain that people can eat It is used to make many things like bread and pasta by first turning it into flour It can also be fermented to make beer alcohol vodka or biofuel The grass plant comes from the Middle East 

An allergy to wheat can cause coeliac disease which makes the sufferer have diarrhoea if they eat any food containing wheat

The wheat plant has long slender leaves stems that are hollow in most types of wheat plants and heads that have many kinds of flowers from 20 to 100 The flowers are grouped together in spikelets Each spikelet has two to six flowers In most spikelets two or three of the flowers become fertilized and this makes them produce the grains used for food

The Taliban is a hardline Islamic movement It emerged in 1994 in Afghanistan and was sponsored by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia During the Talibans rule in Afghanistan it enforced one of the most serious translations of Sharia law in Muslim World but most of their criticism came from leading Muslim scholars They became known internationally for their bad treatment of women 

Following the September 11 attacks in 2001 the United States overthrew the Taliban government for refusing to hand over Osama bin Laden and several al Qaida members who were behind these attacks Taliban is still active in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan

A screw is a sharp piece of threaded metal similar to a nail Unlike a nail a screw has spiraling grooves down its spike A screw is pressed down against wood and spun with a screwdriver so the wood goes into the grooves This prevents the screw from falling out as a nail could Screws are basically divided into wood screws machine screws and self tapping screws 

Machine screws have threads which have to be matched with nuts with female threads Screws can be made of iron steel brass bronze etc

Screw threads are measured either in millimeters or in numbers screws are used in furniture doors appliances mechanical applications etc

Screwing is the neatest way of holding together to materials If no glue is involved then the screwing can be dismantled Screwing can be used to connect all materials 

These are three different types of screw 

Do not place screws in line as this weakens the wood Use the right size screwdriver for the screw head A screwdriver that is too slim can damage the slot too wide can tear the materials

Tajikistan is a country in South central Asia

Tajikistan is one of the new countries in the new block South central Asia It is west of China north of Afghanistan and Pakistan that is separated by a narrow 14 km strip of land in the Pamirs east of Uzbekistan and south of Kyrgyzstan 

Tajikistan is landlocked and it is in the middle of the continent of Asia

Its total area is only about 143100 km  It is slightly smaller than Wisconsin USA Tajikistans borders are 3651 km long

The climate has hot summers and mild winters 

Almost all of the country is mountainous with river valleys running across however high altitude mountains of Pomir are in the eastern part of the country The climate there is semiarid to polar The mountains cover an area of about 120000 km There are other countries within the mountain range The mountains are between 3600 to 4400m high

The land that is now Tajikistan has been lived in since 4000 BC It has been under the rule of various empires throughout history mostly the Persian Empires 

In the year 800 Islam came to Tajikistan 

In 1868 Tajikistan became a Russian Colony It later became a part of the Soviet Union 

On 9 September 1991 after long periods of mass protests against Soviet Government Parliament of Tajikistan declared independence from Soviet Union and held first presidential elections Rahmon Nabiev who run the country during Soviet Union in the late 1970s and early 1980s become president He was unable to bring any much needed reforms to the country and so there were protests in the capital city Dushanbe The government responded by organising a pro government demonstration mainly made of old Communist Party members and people from the southeast of the country brought to the city Anti government protests did not stop so the government gave weapons to the pro government demonstrator Then the Opposition armed themselves

After this bloody civil war broke out In which all of the new democratic parties political organisations and movements together with the political Islamic movements created an alliance opposing the old communist government and southerners

After the September 11 2001 attacks many American and French Soldiers came into the country

Tajikistan is a republic The capital city is Dushanbe The official language is Tajikwhich is a dialect of farsi

Fear is an emotion similar to anxiety A person who fears something does not want it to happen because they think something bad will happen to them if it does Fear is the bodys way of protecting itself from possibly dangerous situations For example if one has a fear of jumping off the cliff heshe will not do it This actually saves one from death In this case fear is a good thing but in others it can be bad An example of fear being bad is if it prevents one from doing something important like going to see a doctor

The tongue is the fleshy muscle inside the mouth A tongue lets us taste because the top of the tongue is made mostly of taste buds It is very flexible so it also helps us eat and talk 

Some people can roll their tongue into a tube The reason why some people are able to and some are not is because of genetic inheritance meaning that it is based on whether their parents are able to do it Many schools use tongue rolling as an example of a genetic trait

People who can roll their tongue can sometimes make a high pitched sound by blowing through their rolled tongue

Titanium is a very strong metal Its one of hundreds of chemical elements in the peoriodic table of the elements Its symbol is Ti and it is used in making the strongest and lightest parts of modern fighter jet planes It does not corrode including resistance to sea water and chlorine

The Hebrew language is a Semitic language It is the language of Israel

The language was spoken by Israelites a long time ago  during the time of the Bible After Judah was conquered by Babylonia the Jews were taken captive to Babylon and started speaking Aramaic Hebrew was no longer used as much in day to day life but it was still known by Jews who studied religious books 

In the 20th century many Jews decided to make Hebrew into a spoken language again It became the language of the new country of Israel in 1948 People in Israel came from many places and decided to learn Hebrew so they could all speak one language

Hebrew is close to the Arabic language Hebrew words are made by combining a root with a pattern In Israeli Hebrew some words are translated from European languages like English French German and Russian Many words from the Old Testament were given new meanings in Israeli Hebrew People learning Hebrew need to study the grammar first in order to read correctly without vowels In Israeli Hebrew there is no verb to be in the present tense only in the future and the past tenses In Biblical Hebrew there are no tenses but only two aspects imperfect and perfect The imperfect is something like the future and the present tenses The perfect is something like the past tense Mishnaic Hebrew is the Hebrew spoken as well as Judeo Aramaic in the time of Jesus and in the time of the Bar Kokhba revolt until the Byzantine Empire of Justinian

Saint Joan of Arc or The Maid of Orlans is a national heroine of France She is also a Catholic saint She was a peasant girl born in the east of France She led the French army to several important victories in the Hundred Years War She said that God was helping her She also helped Charles VII to be crowned king She was taken by the Burgundians sold to the English people tried by an ecclesiastical court and burned at the stake when she was 19 years old

24 years later Pope Callixtus III looked over what the ecclesiastical court had decided He found her innocent and said she was a martyr She was beatified in 1909 and canonized in 1920 She is one of the patron saints of France

Joan said that she had visions from God In these visions she said God told her to take back her homeland from English rule late in the Hundred Years War Many quick victories made her famous

Joan of Arc has remained an important figure in Western civilization Famous writers like Shakespeare Tchaikovsky Mark Twain and Voltaire wrote about her She still comes out in video games television movies songs and dances

When Joan of Arc was put on trial she said no to the customary courtroom rules about a witnesss broken wikt linkoathoath She said she would not answer every question about her visions She complained that the normal witness oath would not be right because she had an oath that she had given to the king It is not known how much the record which reports this has been changed by dishonest court officials or her possible lies to protect state secrets Some historians simply say that her belief in her duty was more important than where the visions came from

Most people say that she was healthy and that she was not crazy Recently people have tried to explain her visions through things like epilepsy migraine tuberculosis and schizophrenia None of these guesses have been greatly supported This is because even though seeing visions can be through different diseases other facts of Joans life do not agree with these ideas Two experts who studied a teberculoma hypothesis in the medical journal Neuropsychobiologysaid It is difficult to draw final conclusions but it would seem unlikely that widespread tuberculosis a serious disease was present in this patient whose life style and activities would surely have been impossible had such a serious disease been present Ralph Hoffman professor of psychology at Yale University points out that visions like hearing voices are not always signs of mental illness He says that her religious inspiration was possibly a reason However he does not say any other reasons

Actually the court of Charles VII was very careful about mental health

The Church said Joan should be killed for wearing mens clothes even after being warned not to Joan agreed to wear womens clothes She wore male clothes again This might have been to protect herself from being attacked It could also have been as Jean Massieu said because her dress had been stolen and she was left with nothing else to wear

People say she was burned on a stake on 30 May 1431 After she died the English showed people her burnt body so no one could say she had escaped alive Then they burned the body two times again to turn it into ashes They put what was left of her in the Seine The executioner Geoffroy Therage later said that he greatly feared to be damned

James Charles Kopp is an American criminal He was found guilty in 2005 for shooting Dr Barnett Slepian to death in 1988 Kopp said the reason he shot the doctor was that he was against the abortions that the doctor did

On October 23 1998 Slepian his wife and their four children came home from synagogue Kopp waited outside the home with a rifle He shot Slepian in the back through a window while Slepian was in the kitchen Slepians wife and son Andrew were standing in the same room with him

Sonic the Hedgehog is a video game character He is a 15factdateJuly 2010 year old blue hedgehog who can run at the speed of sound By curling into a ball and spinning quickly he can do a helpful Spin Attack which he uses to defeat the bad guys and save the day Because he is very fast he hates waiting and he can be a bit rude but he does care about his friends and really hates evil He has been in many games made by the company Sega but also in television series books and comics He has many friends including Miles Tails Prower a two tailed fox that can fly by spinning his tails very quickly or Knuckles the Echidna With them he fights against Doctor Eggman an evil scientist who tries to take over the world Doctor Eggman was also called Doctor Robotnik in America for some time until it was changed to Eggman to match what he was called in Japan

Sonic is the mascot of Sega which created it in the early 1990s At first Sega wanted Doctor Eggman to be their mascot and a good guy But the people in Sega liked the new idea of making a blue hedgehog as the mascot Doctor Eggman settled as the bad guy instead

Here is a list of some games Sonic is in

He appeared in his own made for video movie in 1999 In most of the cartoons from the 1990s his voice was provided by Jaleel White and in later cartoons his voice was provided by Jason Griffith Sonic also stars in his latest cartoon from Japan It is called Sonic X although Sonic X has ended

Here is a list of cartoons Sonic is in

Archie Comics in America has been making comics with Sonic as the main character He is also shown with famous characters like Knuckles and Tails but with also a few new ones Some of the characters are not in any Sonic games but some are in a very old cartoon Sonic the Hedgehog SATAM made by DiC in 1993

A list of Future Final Fantasy games 

Resolution is what can qualify a monitor in computer science It is the number of pixels displayed on a given surface

For example a 640 by 480 display which has 640 pixels from side to side and 480 from top to bottom and therefore has a total number of 640 480 307200 pixels or 03 megapixels is what is meant by 640 480 display resolution

The cervix is the part of the uterus which protrudes into the vaginal canal Its function is like that of a gate to the uterus or womb where the fetus develops It also allows menstrual blood to escape the uterus during the normal reproductive cycle of the female and allows sperm to access the uterus to fertilize an ovum or egg

Bullets are small metal objects fired from guns Many kinds of bullets are made from lead covered with copper They are put into a package called a cartridge The cartridge is put into a gun The bullet is at the front of the cartridge The bullet is pushed out of the gun by hot gases at a high pressure A powder called gunpowder is put inside the case A small explosion from the primer lights the gunpowder The gunpowder burns very fast It makes hot gases The hot gases are at a high pressure The high pressure pushes the bullet out of the gun barrel at a high speed Bullets have many uses They are used as a weapon in war They are used by police They are used for self defense They are used for hunting animals for food or as a sport They are used for shooting targets There are many kinds of bullets Each gun takes a certain size or caliber of bullet Rifles and handguns use different kinds of bullets 

Bullet designs have to solve two main problems A bullet must fit tightly in the guns bore If it does not fit tightly gas from the burning gunpowder leaks past the bullet and does not help push it out The bullet must also fit tightly against the rifling but not so tightly that it causes damage Bullets must have this tight fit without causing too much friction Bullets must be made to a high standard Poorly made bullets may not be accurate Poorly made bullets can damage the gun or hurt the person using the gun The way the bullet behaves in the barrel is called internal ballistics

The laws of physics can be used to understand how a bullet moves after it leaves the barrel The way the bullet behaves after it leaves the barrel is called external ballistics The main factors affecting the aerodynamics of a bullet in flight are the bullets shape and the rotation from the rifling of the gun barrel Spinning helps stabilize the bullet gyroscopically and aerodynamically Any small differences in the shape of the bullet are mostly canceled as it spins The first guns did not have rifling With smooth bore firearms a round bullet was best because it was the same in any position But these bullets were not very stable They were also not very accurate Still the round shape of bullets did not change very much for hundreds of years 

Bullet design also affects what happens when a bullet hits an object The way a bullet behaves when it hits a target is called terminal ballistics The make up and density of the target material the angle at which the bullet hits and the speed and design of the bullet itself are all factors Bullets are usually made to go into a target change shape andor break apart For a given material and bullet the speed of the bullet is the main factor determining what happens 

Making bullets go faster increases the kinetic energy even more This effect is big so people have tried to make bullets that go faster and weigh less Modern firearms take much lighter bullets and shoot them much faster than was the case in World War I This makes the firearms better in two ways The magazine holds more of the smaller lighter bullets Also the higher speed causes much more damage than the old style bullets

The Full Metal Jacket is a type of bullet commonly used by the military A lead center is surrounded by a strong metal coating This jacket is usually made of a copper alloy but sometimes it is made of steel The FMJ does not spread out when it hits a target It goes deep into its target and is a general purpose bullet The FMJ is not recommended for hunting It is mostly for target shooting and military use 

The Jacketed Hollow Point has a lead center with lead showing at the tip It also has a strong metal coating The center of the tip has a hole in it This design makes the tip of the JHP quickly start to spread out when it hits a target The hollow point bullet in a rifle can be as small as a pin When the hollow point is this small the bullet will go faster and still spread out when it hits a living target In some hollow point rifle bullets the front may spread out to two times as wide as the bullet was when it started It is a good hunting bullet because the energy in the bullet is transferred to the target at a known depth The jacketed hollow point tends to be accurate and is sturdy

The plastic tipped bullet is a hollow point bullet The hollow point is filled with a hard pointed plastic tip It is used because it can go further than the JHP and does not curve as much The plastic tipped bullet also spreads out or breaks into pieces when it hits the target

A solid copper bullet is a bullet that has no lead core or other elements than copper This bullet expands into a flower shape when it hits a target because copper bullets are usually hollow point The copper bullet contains no lead so it is also better for the environment In rifles it is widely used for hunting and other sports

A frangible bullet will break into many pieces upon contact with any material harder than itself This bullet is used for safety while shooting It has little impact on the environment It also makes the objects behind the intended target a little safer

Pistol bullets have some of the same names as rifle bullets such as full metal jacket or jacketed hollow point For example there are hollow point pistol bullets that also spread out a lot when they hit a target However in a pistol bullet the hollow point can be much larger The hollow point causes the pistol bullet to slow down faster due to air resistance However a pistol bullet does not have to travel as far as a rifle bullet The hollow point in a pistol bullet can be almost as wide as the bullet When a hollow point pistol bullet hits a target it almost completely flattens itself A solid copper pistol bullet is usually hollow point and is mainly used for self defense andor target shooting

A flat nosed bullet is mostly used in handguns although there are also some rifle bullets called flat nosed The flat nose on a pistol bullet can be as wide as the bullet The flat nose on a rifle bullet may be much smaller The flat nosed bullet tends to have a low ballistic coefficient This means that it slows down faster than pointed bullets Flat nosed bullets are sometimes used to prevent the explosion of the next cartridge in a magazine when the gun recoils Flat nosed bullets also spread out quickly when they hit a target This makes them useful for fighting at close range when the bullet should not hit what is behind the target After hitting the target it becomes almost inside out 

A frangible pistol bullet will break apart on contact It is usually made of a copper jacket over pieces of either round or twisted lead pieces that are glued together The glue breaks apart when the bullet hits the target The pieces spread out This creates a larger surface area This kind of bullet cannot go deep into a target It is safer to use when it is important not to hit anything on the other side of the target

New Orleans is a city in the state of Louisiana in the United States of America 

The city was first built by the French before it became a territory of the United States when President Thomas Jefferson bought the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 It was built at the mouth of the Mississippi River It has been one of the Worlds greatest seaport cities for many years The French located the city a short vertical distance above sea level In the last three hundred years the city has sunk slowly into the marshy soil Large portions of New Orleans are now below sea level A system of many pumps dikes seawall and levees was built 

Over half of the grain that is sent by ship to other countries comes first by barge through the Port of New Orleans The grains are grown in the farming states bordering the Mississippi River the Missouri River and Ohio Rivers Much of the crude oil that is made into gasoline and diesel fuel is brought to New Orleans for refining oil refinery and distribution to other parts of the United States by barge or oil pipeline Also there are many oil well platforms nearby in the Gulf of Mexico

On August 29 2005 New Orleans was hit by Hurricane Katrina which destroyed over 80 of the city when the cities levees broke The nations weather services forecast storms by following changes in this pressure Their work is often very accurate In this storm people knew several days before the storm that it would be very dangerous and very close to New Orleans The very low pressure gave the storm unusual strength The special systems built to protect this under water city failed in several ways Water came over the dikes seawalls and levees at six places The engines on the pumps failed as the water rose above them It is estimated that more than three quarters of New Orleans was under water in early September of 2005 The very deep water caused failure of sewer phone electric and fresh water systems Many people drowned Many homes were completely covered with water Many important records some from the French period of the 1700s were destroyed

Many people believed that a flood in New Orleans would happen They spoke openly about this concern for many years A very serious flood happened several hundred miles upstream on the Mississippi River when heavy rains fell in 1927 The severe hardships from this flood led many people to move away Many moved to Chicago

After Hurricane Katrina many people who lived in the flooded city moved to other places in the US Many people were afraid to move back Their jobs and homes were gone and their possessions were lost The people who could move back spread to many other states Texas is the largest state and has received the most flood victims Many volunteers and charities are helping the flood victims to relocate to new homes and at the same time repair homes and services in this city

Several years after Katrina New Orleans still had much fewer people than it did before the hurricane

Texas holdem is a popular version of the card game poker 

Before any cards are dealt two players to the left of the dealer make bets which are called the Small Blind and Big Blind These forced bets must be at least matched by the other players in order to keep their hands The big blind is twice as much as the small blind If the big blind was 1000 then it is said that the blinds are 500 and 1000 This money is put into a place in the center of the table that is called the pot

Each player is given two cards face down These are called the players Hole Cards or what the player has in the hole Once all the players have their hole cards the betting starts The player to the left of the Big Blind player starts the betting The lowest amount that can be bet is the amount of the big blind Players can bet more than the minimum This is called Raising The amount a player can raise is determined by the type of the game being played If a player raises the amount he raised the bet to is the new minimum Each player in turn may either Call Raise or Fold This action keeps going around the table until each player has called or folded his hand

After the first turn of betting is over the dealer lays three cards face up on the table This is called the Flop These three cards are community cards This means they are used by every player in the game along with the two hole cards each player has After the flop another turn of betting takes place There is no starting bet in this turn unless a player makes a bet Players may Check or bet nothing if no player before them in the turn has bet If everyone checks or if a player bets and all the others call or fold then the round of betting is over

Next the dealer lays another community card face up This card is called the turn Another series of betting comes after this This betting is the same as after the Flop

Finally the dealer lays the last community card known as the river This card is again followed by a turn of betting calling and folding by the players 

With the five community cards and their two hole cards each player makes the best 5 card poker hand he can The player with the best poker hand wins the round and the pot If two or more players have the same hand those players split the pot evenly If one person bets and all other players have folded the hand ends then and that player wins

Texas Holdem can be played several ways including Limit Pot Limit and No Limit games The version of the game usually is the maximum a player can raise at any one time

Limit games have a set amount that a player can raise at any time If a game has a 10 limit then a raise must be exactly 10 If more than one person raises each one can only raise 10 more than the last raise Typically there is a cap of 3 raises per round Also when playing limit the bet and raise amount will usually double for the turn and river betting rounds

In a 4 player game Player A bets 10 Player B raises 10 Player C calls Player B Player D at this point can either fold pay 20 or raise 10 to a total of 30 Player A would go next and either call This would continue until all players either call or fold

In Pot Limit games the most a player can bet or raise is the total amount in the pot With each bet or raise the amount in the pot gets larger This allows for larger raises 

In Spread Limit games there is both a minimum and a maximum raise specified For example one could play 5 50 spread limit The big blind would be 5 and the minimum raise would be 5 and the maximum raise would be 50

In No Limit there is not a limit of how much can be bet at any time That is it is just like Spread Limit but with no maximum A player can bet up to all money as he has If a player bets all of his money he is said to be All In If a player bets more money than another player has the second player can call by going All In If only those two players stay in the hand the first player takes back any money that is over the amount the player going All In has At this point all betting stops and the dealer deals out the rest of the cards

If a player goes All In and two or more players are still betting the other betters can raise each other until they both call A side pot is made in this case It is the difference between the final bet and the first persons All In Only the two players were not All In can win this pot If the All In player wins the hand he wins the main pot and which ever of the other two players had the better hand wins the side pot In an eight player game it is possible to have several side pots with several people being All In at the same time If there are not two player left who can bet betting stops and all players turn their hands over 

Player A bets 5000 Player B only has 3000 He goes All In Player C Raises 2000 Player A calls At this point the main pot is worth 9000 The side pot is worth 8000

If player A or C wins he wins both the main pot and the side pot and Player B is out of the game since he is out of money If player B wins he wins the main pot and the side pot goes to which ever player has the best hand between players A and C

Tournaments are what people often see when poker is shown on television When a player enters a tournament he pays an entry fee called the buy in Most of his buy in is placed with other players money in the prize pool Usually a small portion of the buy in is kept by the tournament officials for their expenses The player is given a table and seat assignment and a certain number of chips  the same amount as every other player Unlike normal chips these tournament chips have no cash value Players must continue to play until they run out of chips The tournament continues until one player has accumulated all of the chips The order in which people lose all their chips is their finishing order That is the last player to bust out is the second place finisher The prize pool is divided amongst a fraction of the top finishers The first place winner usually gets a much larger share with the prizes diminishing until the prize pool is empty The player who was the last player to finish without winning any prize is said to have finished on the bubble

As players bust out of the tournament the average players chip stack gets larger In order to insure that the blinds do not become insignificant in the face of the growth in chip stacks tournaments are played in timed rounds At the beginning of each round typically the blinds increase Every few rounds there will be a short break between rounds For tournaments that last longer than a day there will be a last level for the day and the tournament will resume the next day

Most tournaments only allow a player to buy in and receive chips once at the beginning These are called freeze out tournaments Some tournaments allow players to buy in more than once for the first few levels of the tournament These players are said to re buy and the money they use to re buy goes into the prize pool with the rest of the buy ins

Creationism is the belief that the universe was created in the way described in religious texts According to Creationism a creator god directly created life from the nothingness that was before or he did so by fixing the chaos that was The first approach is known as creatio ex nihilo which is the Latin name for creation from nothing 

Creationism as it is known today started in the 19th century by fundamentalist Protestants who were opposed to the theories that scientists began to put forward from research about the Geologic time scale and how life came to be One such theory is called evolution 

In the 20th century creationist movements also started in Islam and Judaism

Creationists usually do not believe that all of todays living things came about from simple organisms changing slowly over time They believe that life was created much as it is today and that one form of life cannot change into another While evolutionists say that fossils are different from the life we see today and can be put into order to show changes over time Creationists say that there is not evidence and argue that nearly every living thing that has a fossil counterpart is practically identical to it They also argue that the order is random because there is no place on earth where the rock layers are completely intact 

Some people do not believe their religious book to be word for word true and say God used evolution to create mankind and other life This idea is called theistic evolution 

Christian Creationism says that Noahs flood is important to creationism They argue that the first buried fossils of each group are complete and complex strong support for the biblical concept that each kind of life was created well designed to multiply after its own kind They think that Cambrian trilobites and Jurassic dinosaurs all lived together on the earth at the same time and that the Bible is literally true They point to the perfection of Earths size shape and distance as designed by God and Earths imperfections as proofs that the Earth is dirtied by humans sin They believe that God created the world in six days as it was said in the Book of Genesis

Islamic creationism is the belief that the universe was directly created by God as explained in the Quran Currently Islam takes religious texts literally Many scholars say that Genesis is a corrupted version of Gods message There is also a creation myth in the Quran but it is more vague than Genesis This allows for more interpretation Several liberal movements within Islam generally accept the scientific positions on the age of the earth the age of the universe and evolution

Islam also has its own school of Evolutionary creationismTheistic evolutionism which says that mainstream scientific analysis of the origin of the universe is supported by the Quran Many Muslims believe in evolutionary creationism especially among Liberal movements within Islam

Khalid Anees president of the Islamic Society of Britain attended a conference called Creationism Science and Faith in Schools During that conference he made points including the following There is no contradiction between what is revealed in the Koran and natural selection and survival of the fittest However some Muslims such as Adnan Oktar do not agree that one species can develop from another 

But there is also a growing movement of Islamic creationism Like the movement in Christianity Islamic creationists are concerned that the findings of evolutionary theory might contradict what is written in the Quran 

There are several verses in the Quran which some modern writers have interpreted as being compatible with the expansion of the universe Big Bang and Big Crunch theories

Do not the Unbelievers see that the skies and the earth were joined together then We clove them asunder and We created every living thing out of the water Will they not then believeQuran usc2130

Then turned He to the sky when it was smoke and said unto it and unto the earth Come both of you willingly or loth They said We come obedientQuran usc4111

And it is We Who have constructed the sky with might and it is We Who are steadily expanding itQuran usc5147

On the day when We will roll up the sky like the rolling up of the scroll for writings as We originated the first creation We shall reproduce it a promise surely We will bring it aboutQuran usc21104

Scientists who oppose the beliefs of creationism and Intelligent Design say that creationism is not a true science And so they have kept it from being taught in schools in the US and many other countries

The flute is a woodwind instrument A person who plays the flute is called a flautist in British English or flutist in American English It is played by blowing across a hole in the instrument rather like blowing over the top of an empty bottle Flutes overblow at the octave That means that once you have used up all your fingers for the first octave you can get the notes an octave higher by using the same fingering again but blowing a little harder

Flutes were traditionally made of wood which is why they are called woodwind instruments Nowadays they are mostly made of metal which makes them much easier to mass produce Most wood wind instruments require a reed but the technical definition would be any instrument made from wood

The form of flute used in western classical music is blown from the side and has keys which are pressed with the fingers to cover the holes This key system was invented in the 19th century by Theobald Boehm In the Renaissance keyless cylindrical flutes made in several sizes were often played in groups or consorts and sounded best played specific modes Baroque flutes which developed in the third quarter of the seventeenth century had a single key which makes it necessary for players to learn to play all the sharps and flats using cross fingerings By the early eighteenth century skilled players were able to play in tune in as many as eighteen to nineteen keys By the late eighteenth century several keys were added but the basic design and technique still derived from that of the one keyed model Early flutes were designed to make enharmonic distinctions between notes in order to play in non equal tempered tunings Modern flute players often find the technique of renaissance baroque and classical period flutes to be especially difficult if they come to these instruments from Boehm flute 

There is a very large repertoire of music for the flute Baroque composers used them in their orchestras usually in pairs and composed concertos chamber music and solo music for them This has continued to the present day Orchestras have at least 2 flutes sometimes three or four Sometimes there is a piccolo which plays an octave higher or an alto flute which plays a fifth lower than the flute

The flute can sound very bright and cheerful when playing high notes Listen for example to the Badinerie from Bachs Orchestral Suite no 2 It can also sound very thoughtful or sad when playing in its lowest register A good example is the opening of Debussys Prlude laprs midi dun fauneGo flutes

The oldest kind of side blown flute was made in India In India a flute called bansuri is used It has no keys and is often made of bamboo or cane

In China a simple flute is used which has no keys The Chinese flute sometimes has a thin piece of paper over one hole which adds a bright raspiness to the sound It is the best

There are other kinds of flute that are played by blowing into the end like a recorder Some of these are tin whistle flageolet tabor pipe and ocarina

In Japan there is a kind of flute called a shakuhachi made from the bottom of a bamboo plant It is blown at the end but is not like the recorder because it does not have an opening that guides the air across a hole that makes the sound

In South America there is a flute called a quena that makes its sound the same way as the shakuhachi

The Pan pipes are a form of flute with no holes It has more than one pipe connected together with the bottom closed The player blows across the top of one of the pipes to make a note The pipes are in different sizes so that each one makes a different note They are named after Pan who played this instrument in Greek myth

The band Jethro Tull features a flute player in many songs One of which is the hit Locomotive Breath

Staind is an American rock band from Massachusetts United States The band was started in 1993 Its first album Tormented was released in 1996 Stainds newest album The Illusion of Progress was released on August 19 2008 Some of its biggest hits have been Outside Its Been Awhile and So Far Away

Ocarina is a kind of flute that is not made out of a tube Because the ocarina is in a round or box like shape its sound is a little different from other flutes

The ten hole ocarina was first made by Giuseppe Donati in Italy in 1853 Instruments like the ocarina had been made for hundreds of years before that in South America China and Africa In Europe a form called the gemshorn was made in the 16th century The gemshorn was made from an animal horn

In the 19th century groups of ocarina players with different sized ocarinas played classical and folk music Italian ocarinas became known throughout the world because of this

In the United States the ocarina was called the sweet potato because its shape is like a sweet potato

In 1928 the Japanese began making ocarinas They added two small holes to the old kind of ocarinas Japanese 12 hole ocarinas can play a larger scale than 10 hole ocarinas

In the 1960s the English ocarina was invented It has four finger holes and may have one or two thumb holes English ocarinas are made in many shapes

The clarinet is a woodwind instrument

The clarinet has one reed The reed is made of wood The reed is attached to the mouthpiece with a clamp called a ligature which is usually made out of metal  Blowing through the mouthpiece makes the reed shake and therefore makes the noise The body of the clarinet is a cylindrical tube with holes The holes are covered by the fingers to make musical notes There are also buttons pressed by the fingers which allow pads over holes to open or close so all notes of the chromatic scale can be played

One kind of keyed clarinet is called the Albert clarinet Another kind is called the Boehm clarinet 

The Boehm clarinet is much used by classical orchestras and by jazz musicians In North America the most popular clarinet is the clarinet pitched in B flat This clarinet is used in concert marching and school bands The A clarinet is also used by musicians for orchestra

A beginner clarinet player usually can play a note within the first ten minutes of instruction Making a sound with the clarinet is easier than making a sound with many other musical instruments Most instrumental music teachers consider it to be a good instrument for young players The fingering system is very similar to the flute and the saxophone so changing from playing the clarinet to one of these instruments is not too difficult after the student is comfortable playing the clarinet and has reached a certain level

A famous piece that features a clarinet is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts work 622 which has the clarinet playing a melody with the rest of the orchestra playing along 

The 16th century is the century from 1501 to 1600 In this century many Europeans visited or moved to the newly found Americas and some also searched for new routes to Asia There was much change in Europe such as the Protestant Reformation

Note years before or after the 16th century are in italics

The lute is a kind of musical instrument with strings

The first lutes were brought to Spain by the Moors Others may have been brought to Europe from Arabic lands The lute is one of the ancestors of the classical guitar

A lute has an oval shaped back made of strips of wood It has a flat front with a neck attached to it Early lutes had four strings or eight sets of two strings Beneath these strings there were strings tied to the neck where the player pressed down to make the notes These strings were called frets

The front part of the body is made of a flat piece of wood and known as the sound board It has a beautifully carved hole in the center which is called the rose

The lute was at first played by strumming or plucking with a pick Later they were played with the fingers alone

During the Renaissance bigger lutes were designed Most lutes at this time had seven or eight sets of strings New kinds of lutes were invented One new kind of lute made in the Renaissance was the theorbo Another kind was the archlute

In European classical music the lute was changed into the harpsichord and the mandolin

Today there are kinds of lute still being played in Greece Turkey and in Arabic speaking countries The Renaissance lute is also played today in western countries as well as a German lute that is played the same way as a guitar

Afrikaans is a West Germanic language mainly spoken in South Africa and Namibia It was originally the dialect that developed among the Afrikaner Protestant settlers the unfree workers and slaves brought to the Cape area in southwestern South Africa by the Dutch East India Company between 1652 and 1705 Most of these first settlers were from the United Provinces though there were also many from Germany some from France a few from Scotland and various other countries The unfree workers and slaves were Malays and Malagasy in addition to the native Khoi and Bushmen

Manhattan is an island which is part of New York City It is the center of the New York Metropolitan Area an island and the biggest borough in New York City though it is the most densely populated borough 

The Dutch bought it from the Native Americans and called it New Amsterdam then the English took it over and changed the name to New York The name Manhattan comes from the Munsi language of the Lenni Lenape meaning island of many hills Other theories contend that it comes from one of three Munsi words Manahactanienk meaning place of inebriation Other possibilities are manahatouh meaning a place where wood is available for making bows and arrows and menatay meaning simply the island 

Manhattan is a major commercial financial and cultural center of both the United States and the world Most major radio television and telecommunications companies in the United States are based there as well as many news magazine book and other media publishers Manhattan has many famous landmarks tourist attractions museums and universities It is also home to the headquarters of the United Nations 

Before colonization the Lenape Indians lived in the area that is now known today as Manhattan In 1524 Lenape people in canoes met Giovanni da Verrazzano the first European explorer to pass New York Harbor although he may not have entered the harbor past the Narrows It was not until the voyage of Henry Hudson an Englishman who worked for the Dutch East India Company that the area was mapped

In the 1620s the first large European colony began in New Netherland when the Dutch began trading fur on Governors Island In 1625 the Dutch chose Manhattan Island to build Fort Amsterdam a citadel for the protection of the new arrivals It would later be called New Amsterdam The creation of New Amsterdam was recognized as the birth of New York City 

In 1626 Manhattan was bought from the Native Americans living on the island at the time The price was trading goods worth 60 guilders which was worth about 24 dollars at the time The currency calculations from the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam say that 60 guilders in the 1620s cost around 1000 now 

In 1647 Peter Stuyvesant became the last Dutch Director General of the colony New Amsterdam was considered an official city on 3 February 1653 In 1664 the British conquered New Netherland and renamed it New York after the English King James II then known as Duke of York and Albany Stuyvesant and his council made a deal with the British where New Netherlanders were promised liberties including freedom of religion under British rule In August 1673 the Dutch took control of the island again calling the city New Orange The Dutch lost control of New Netherland forever to the English in November 1674 by treaty

Manhattan was the center of many campaigns battles and meetings during the American Revolution In 1765 all of the colonies worked together for the first time unified political aim when the Stamp Act Congress of representatives from across the Thirteen Colonies was held in New York City to write The Declaration of Rights and Grievances

Manhattan was the center of a series of large battles in the early American Revolutionary War These battles were called the New York Campaign where British forces and colonists fought for control of New York City and the state of New Jersey The Continental Army the army that had fought in favor of the thirteen colonies led by George Washington had to leave Manhattan after the Battle of Fort Washington on 16 November 1776 The main reason they had to leave was because the battle had caused a lot of damage to the city As a result the British had control of the area and used the city as the center for their political and military purposes for the rest of the war 

While the British ruled Manhattan was greatly damaged by the Great Fire of New York in 1776 Shortly after Washington came back to Manhattan with his army On Evacuation Day the British occupation and the last of their forces had left that city on 25 November 1783 In 1784 the Continental Army was broken up and the United States Army took its place On 30 April 1789 Washington was inaugurated the first president of the United States and took his oath of office at Federal Hall on Wall Street 

In the early 19th century Manhattan grew in population and economically Because of the Great Irish Famine a lot of Irish people emigrated to live in New York they made up for 25 of Manhattans population at the time  Many of the Irish people lived in a part of the Lower East Side known as the Bowery or in another section called Five Points

The rate of immigration from Europe shot up after the Civil War and New York became the most popular state for immigrants in the United States Because of this the French built and gave New York the Statue of Liberty on October 28 1886 Soon after the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn were combined into one city

In the beginning of the 20th century many new things were built in the city like skyscrapers and the New York City Subway The first subway transit center the Interborough Rapid Transit or IRT opened to the public in 1904 The installation of the Subway helped tie the new city together as did new bridges to Brooklyn In the 1920s many African Americans came to live in Manhattan during the Great Migration from the American South and the Harlem Renaissance New York City became the most populous city in the world in 1925 overtaking London which had held the title for a century

Between World War I and World War II reformist Fiorello La Guardia was elected as the new mayor in 1933 and took office in 1934 marking the fall of Tammany Hall after 80 years of dominating politics in New York City Once the citys demographics were steadier labor unionization provided protection and affluence to the working class Despite the Great Depression some of the worlds tallest skyscrapers of the time were built in Manhattan during the 1930s including many Art Deco masterpieces that are still part of the citys skyline today The most well known structures are Empire State Building the Chrysler Building and the GE Building

Following the end of World War II a lot of veterans came home to the United States This led to the development of private communities that were intended to be sold or rented out to returning soldiers resulting in an economic boom An example of one of the communities built to attract veterans looking for homes is Stuyvesant TownPeter Cooper Village which opened in 1947 In 1951 the United Nations relocated from its first headquarters in Queens to the East Side of Manhattan

Crime rates began to drop greatly in the 1990s Murder rates were 537 in 2008 compared to 2245 in 1990 The crack epidemic and its associated drug related violence had died down and was under great control by the city Many people who had moved out of the city came back because the city once again became the destination of immigrants from around the world joining with low interest rates and Wall Street bonuses to fuel the growth of the real estate market

Triangles can also be grouped by their angles

Triangles are extremely useful because the ratio of the length of sides to an angle is always the same Measuring objects using triangles is called Trigonometry Some people have spent their entire lives studying triangles for use in trigonometry

Modern computers usually use triangles to make more complex graphic images or shapes 

Benchmarks can measure the skills of the computer or the computer user These are the 50 most basic computer user skills The computer skills needed to use a computer view documents create documents and to print to a connected printer

Feminism is a social and political movement Feminism is about changing the way that people see men and women Feminism said that women were poorly treated in the past and that this must stop Somebody who follows feminism is called a feminist

There are many different types of feminism

There are also many other types of feminism

Feminism started with the idea that human rights should be given to women This idea was put forward by some philosophers in the 18th and 19th centuries such as Mary Wollstonecraft and John Stuart Mill Later feminists in the early 20th century also said that women should be allowed to vote in a democracy Many women felt very strongly that they should be allowed to vote and there were many protests These women were called Suffragettes This is because they were fighting for Universal Suffrage which means everybody is able to vote The Suffragettes staged many protests for their rights Some women even committed suicide to show how wrong it was that they could not take part in politics After women received the vote feminism worked to make all of society more equal for women

There are many reasons why some people do not like feminism

There are also many other types of anti feminism

The hippopotamus or hippo from the ancient Greek for river horse is a large mammal in Africa that usually eats plants It is one of the only two species in the family Hippopotamidae that are still alive The other is the Pygmy Hippopotamus The hippopotamus is the third largest land animal It is also the heaviest artiodactyl even though it is much shorter than the giraffe 

The hippopotamus is semi aquatic This means that even though it usually lives on the land it spends a great amount of time in rivers and lakes where males lead groups of 5 to 30 females and young In the daytime they keep cool by staying in the water or mud They give birth to baby hippos in the water too At dusk they come out to graze on grass Hippopotamuses rest together in the water but they like to graze by themselves

The hippopotamus has a torso that is shaped like a barrel very big mouth and teeth almost hairless body short legs and great size It is the third largest land mammal judging by its weight which is between between 1 and 3 tonnes The white rhinoceros weighs 1 to 3 tonnes and the three species of elephant weigh 3 to 9 tonnes Even though it has short fat legs it can run more quickly than a human Some hippos have run at 30 kmh for short distances The hippopotamus is one of the fiercest animals in the world It is often called one of the most dangerous animals in Africa There are about 125000 to 150000 hippos in Sub Saharan Africa Zambia and Tanzania have the most hippos They are threatened because they are losing their habitats and being poached for their meat and ivory teeth

The word hippopotamus comes from the ancient Greek hippopotamos from hippos horse and potamos which means river So hippopotamus means horse of the river More than one hippopotamus are called hippopotamuses hippopotami or hippos Hippopotamuses are social About 30 hippos live together in groups This kind of group is called a pod herd dale or bloat A male hippopotamus is known as a bull A female hippopotamus is called a cow and a baby hippo is called a calf The species is also known as the Common Hippopotamus or the Nile Hippopotamus

Hippopotamuses are the fourth largest mammals in the world The Egyptian Hippopotamus is much smaller than the others however They can live in the water or on land They swim very well and can walk or even run along the bottom of a river

Because hippos are so large it is difficult to weigh them in the wild Most adult male hippos weigh between convert15001800kgabbron Females hippos are smaller and usually weigh between convert13001500kgabbron Older males can get even bigger They are at least convert3200kgabbron and sometimes even weigh convert4500kgabbron

Male hippos seem to keep on growing for their whole lives Females hippos though become heaviest when they are about 25 years old

Hippos have big and heavy bodies dark gray skin and short legs A hippos main defence is their extremely strong mouth Hippos are actually strong enough to break an alligator in half with one bitefactdateJuly 2010 but they are usually not violent unless something attacks their babies They can grow to be 15 feet long and weigh 3000 pounds 

Hippopotamuses are herbivores They live in groups Sometimes 30 hippopotamuses will live in the same place They swim very well and can actually walk along the bottom of the river They usually stay in the mud and water during the day and come out to eat grass or leaves at night The people of the Congo love to eat hippopotamus meat Many of the hippos are killed for food even though it is illegal 

Many hippos lived in North Africa and Europe until about 30000 years ago They used to be common in Egypts Nile region from long ago though they are not there now Pliny the Elder writes that in his time the best place in Egypt for finding this animal was in the Saite nome The animal could still be found around there after the Arab Conquest in 639 Hippos are still found in the rivers and lakes of Uganda Sudan Somalia Kenya northern Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ethiopia west through Ghana to Gambia and also in Southern Africa Some hippos also live in Tanzania and Mozambique They like to live in places with water that is not too deep

Hippos are very aggressive towards humans whom they commonly attack whether in boats or on land with no apparent provocation This aggression by the Hippopotamus is caused by humans coming to close to their children Hippopotamuss are very protective of their young and they often fear that humans pose a large threat to their young They are widely considered to be one of the most dangerous large animals in Africa

The earliest proof that humans were involved with hippos comes from butchery cut marks on hippo bones at Bouri Formation from around 160000 years ago Later rock paintings and engravings showing hippos being hunted They have been found in the mountains of the central Sahara from 40005000 years ago near Djanet Ancient Egyptians also knew much about hippos They knew the hippo was a fierce wild animal that lived in the Nile In Egyptian mythology Tawaret a goddess of protection in pregnancy and childbirth had the head of a hippo This was because ancient Egyptians saw how protective female hippopotamuses could be about their young

Eris is a dwarf planet and a trans Neptunian object It is located in the outer Solar System It is the largest dwarf planet known even bigger than Pluto at 2400 km in diameter Eris is a scattered disc object and it is found within the Kuiper belt further out than Pluto It is also called a pluton because its size orbit and location are similar to that of PlutofactdateDecember 2011 Eris orbits the sun once every 557 Earth years and it has an elliptical orbit tilted at an angle of 44 It has only one moon called Dysnomia

Eris was discovered by Michael E Brown Chad Trujillo and David Rabinowitz on January 5 2005 when they were having a close look at some images of the outer Solar System taken in 2003 Dysnomia was orrigionally named Gabrielle

Eris was originally called Xena after the main character of the television series Xena Warrior Princess However there is a rule stating that all objects orbiting outside Neptunes orbit have to be named after a creation of mythology Therefore it was officially named Eris on September 13 2006 Eris is named after the goddess of strife discord contention and rivalry in Greek mythology

Eris has one moon called Dysnomia It was discovered on September 10 2005 Dysnomia was originally nicknamed Gabrielle after a character from the television series Xena Warrior Princess like Eris However like Eris it could not be called this Dysnomia was named after the daughter of Eris in Greek mythology Dymnosia is the goddess of lawlessness and poor civil constitution

Many media reports have argued that Eris is the tenth planet along with astronomers and NASA scientists However the definition of a planet was re defined in August 2006 Under the new specifications Eris along with Pluto was lowered in status to a dwarf planet

Scientists are continuing to find out more about Eris and its moon and to look for any more moons and rings

The White House is the home and main workplace of the President of the United States The house was designed by Irish born James Hoban It is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington DC The building was built between 1792 and 1800 of white painted Aquia sandstone in the Neoclassical style It has been the home of every US President since John Adams When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801 he expanded the building outward They made two colonnades that were meant to hide stables and storage

In 1814 during the War of 1812 the mansion was set on fire by the British Army in the Burning of Washington The fire destroyed the inside of the house and charred much of the outside Reconstruction began almost immediately President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed house in October 1817 Construction continued with the addition of the South Portico in 1824 and the North in 1829 Because of crowding within the executive mansion itself President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices moved to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901 Eight years later President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office This was eventually moved as the section was expanded The third floor attic was changed into living quarters in 1927 A newly built East Wing was used as a reception area for social events Jeffersons colonnades connected the new wings East Wing changes were completed in 1946 These changes made more office space By 1948 the houses load bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure Under Harry S Truman the interior rooms were completely taken apart and a new internal load bearing steel frame was built inside the walls Once this work was done the interior rooms were rebuilt

Today the White House Complex includes the Executive Residence West Wing Cabinet Room Roosevelt Room East Wing and the Old Executive Office Building which houses the executive offices of the President and Vice President

The Portuguese language is one of the of Romance languages The Portuguese word for Portuguese is portugus

The Portuguese language is the third most spoken western language with about 2000000 million native speakers and a few more millions all over the world because of the people of Portugal Brazil Cape Verde Angola Mozambique etc who traveled to many different parts of the world 

As Portuguese and Spanish are both Romance languages they have a lot of things in common but they are not the same Usually a Portuguese speaker can understand a Spanish speaker On the other hand it is rarer that a Spanish speaker can understand a Portuguese speaker For example I opened the window very fast so as to have dinner translates as Abri a janela muito rpido para jantar in Portuguese and Abr la ventana muy pronto para cenar in Spanish Although the Portuguese written language seems similar to Spanish most spoken Portuguese does not At times it may even sound more like French due to both languages using vowels where air passes through the nose in the nasal cavities For example the first three letters of bom dia sound very much like the first three letters of the same idea in French bonjour The vowel o here is called a nasal vowel its symbol in the IPA is  Overall Portuguese is not any more similar to English than Spanish

The places where people speak Portuguese as the first language are Angola Brazil Cape Verde East Timor Guinea Bissau Macau Mozambique Portugal So Tom and Prncipe and in the cities of Goa Daman and Diu

Portuguese and English have words that mean the same thing and look similar as well This is       because these words came from the same languages

The list is long

Some English words come from Portuguese for example tank cacao and marmalade

Portuguese is the official language of all countries of the CPLP The Portuguese speaking countries have more than 240 million people across the world The CPLP was formed in 1996 with seven countries Portugal Brazil Angola Cape Verde Guinea Bissau Mozambique and So Tom and Prncipe East Timor joined in 2002 

The CPLP nations speak Portuguese with different accents In some regions of Brazil the pronoun tu is not used as much as in Portugal Also regional slang can be found in different areas The Portuguese Orthographic Agreement of 1990 tries to smooth over those differences

Hurricane Katrina was a hurricane in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was the most expensive natural disaster as well as one of the five deadliest hurricanes in the history of the United States Parts of the states of Mississippi and Alabama were also badly damaged or flooded It was the most expensive and one of the deadliest natural disasters in the history of the United States Over 1800 people were killed by the storm with 1577 in Louisiana and 238 in Mississippi However the worst property damage was in coastal areas of Louisiana Mississippi and Alabama such as all Mississippi beachfront towns which were flooded over 90 in hours as boats and casino barges rammed buildings pushing cars and houses inland with waters reaching 612 miles from the beach In Alabama large fishing boats a small ship and an oil rig came ashore as beach homes and coastal buildings were flooded by waters 1122 ft deep

Hurricane Katrina was the eleventh tropical storm fifth hurricane and the second Category 5 hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season The storm formed over the Bahamas on August 23 where it moved east and hit Florida as a Category 1 hurricane two days later Katrina then crossed over Florida and strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico The storm then hit Louisiana and Mississippi on the morning of August 29 The leftovers of Katrina then died out over the Great Lakes on August 31

The damages Katrina brought were so bad that 80 of New Orleans was flooded when the levees to the city broke Most of the people killed by Katrina were thought to be from drowning Because of Katrinas effect on the United States of America the hurricane was known to be one of the most deadly hurricanes in US history

Hurricane Katrina began as Tropical Depression Twelve over the southeastern Bahamas on August 23 2005 The depression later strengthened into a tropical storm on the morning of August 24 where the storm was also named Katrina Katrina continued to move into Florida and became a Category 1 hurricane only two hours before it made landfall around Hallandale Beach on the morning of August 25 The storm weakened over land but became a hurricane again while entering the Gulf of Mexico

Katrina began to gain strength very quickly after entering the Gulf partly because of the storm moving over to the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico On August 27 Hurricane Katrina reached Category 3 strength on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale becoming the third major hurricane of the season An eyewall replacement cycle once made Katrina stop becoming stronger for a short moment but made Katrina to become nearly twice as large in the end

Katrina again began to quickly strengthen reaching Category 5 strength on the morning of August 28 and reached its strongest point with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph and a minimum central pressure of 902 mbar Katrinas minimal pressure measurement made it the fourth most powerful Atlantic hurricane on record at the time only to be beaten by Hurricanes Rita and Wilma later in the season In addition Katrina was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico at the time

Katrina made its second landfall on August 29 as a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 125 mph near stbernard Louisiana At landfall hurricane force winds reached outward 120 miles from the center and the storms central pressure was 920 mbar After moving over southeastern Louisiana it made its third landfall over New Orleans Louisiana and the levees where not made to withstand that much water and ended up collapsing leading to massive flooding Katrina kept its hurricane strength well into Mississippi but began to weaken later finally losing hurricane strength more than 150 miles inland near Meridian Mississippi Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville Tennessee but its remnants were last seen around the eastern Great Lakes on August 31 when it became extratropical The leftover extratropical cyclone moved quickly to the northeast and affected Ontario and Quebec

American filmmaker Spike Lee made a HBO documentary When The Levees Broke that shows the extensive damage in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina The documentary suggests that the damage caused was due to the inability of the levees to weather the storm or a probable sabotage The documentary also suggests that the federal government did a poor job of disaster management Resources arrived after several days and most of the people who died did so from drowning

The name Katrina was retired for the record breaking damage the deaths and the economic impact This means that it will not be used as a name for any new storms in the future A new name Katia is on the list for 2011

nice sound and even beter if you have a moustache A bass guitar is a string instrument which is related to the electric guitar The bass guitar is shaped like an electric guitar except that it is longer than an electric guitar The electric bass has many of the same parts as an electric guitar However the bass guitar produces lower tones than the electric guitar 

The bass guitar is used to play low musical sounds called bass lines in many styles of music such as rock music pop music country music jazz fusion music and many more

The bass guitar was first made in the 1930s by inventor Paul Tutmarc from Seattle Washington However very few musicians were interested in the instrument that Tutmarc made It was the 1950s when musicians finally started to play the double bass in jazz blues folk early rock music and bluegrass The double bass was big heavy hard to carry around and was hard to play precise notes on Musicians wanted a smaller instrument that weighed less Inventors tried to think of ways of building a smaller and lighter bass instrument One of these inventors was a man named Leo Fender in the United States Leo Fender developed a bass guitar in the 1950s using the ideas developed by Tutmarc 

Leo Fender used many parts for the bass guitar that are similar to the parts of an electric guitar Leo Fender called the instrument the Fender Precision Bass He used the word Precision in the name because his instrument had metal frets on the neck The double bass did not have frets on its neck The frets on the bass guitar made it easier for musicians to play precise notes The bass guitar developed by Leo Fender became very popular In the 2000s many bass guitars are still designed to look like his Fender Precision Bass

Bass guitars are normally made out of wood Bass guitars have a few main pieces such as a body neck fingerboard frets and strings The body is made out of wood A wooden neck is glued or bolted onto the body A wooden fingerboard is then glued onto the neck Then thin metal strips called frets are glued onto the fingerboard Frets are placed at specific locations along the fretboard with each fret representing one half step in the Western tonal scale

At the bottom of the body is an assembly called the bridge a large metal assembly into which one end of the strings are fitted On some designs the strings are fasted through the back of the body into the bridge on others the strings fit into the front side of the bridge Inside the body is a cavity that contains the electrical components of the bass The bridge often has adjustments that allow the height of the strings to be changed In addition to the bridge the other components found on the body include one or more pickups and various knobs or switches that control the sound of the bass

The pickups are magnetic devices that sit below the strings As the strings vibrate an electrical signal is produced which is routed via an instrument cable to an amplifier Pickups are either passive which means they send the signal with no additional amplification or active which process the signal through a pre amplifier Some basses feature pickups that can be set to passive or active mode Basses that have two pickups often have a switch that enables the player to select neck only bridge only or a blended signal Each pickup may have different tonal qualities that results from its placement relative to the bridge and its components

At the other end of the fretboard from the body sits the headstock which generally holds the tuners that permit the player to adjust the tuning of the strings At the very end the fretboard where the strings pass from the fretboard to the tuners we find the nut a piece made of metal or plastic with grooves to hold the strings off the fretboard

Inside most fretboards is a long metal rod called a trussrod that is used to adjust the tension on the neck It is generally desirably to have the neck bowed slightly concave so that the strings will clear all frets without buzzing The amount of bow along with adjustments made on the bridge will determine the height of the strings along the fretboard 

The scale of an electric bass  the length of the strings from the nut to the bridge  is generally 34 inches although shorter and longer basses are produced In earlier decades short scale basses were more common since many designers adapted guitar parts for early models Because in some styles of music such as heavy metal the strings are tuned down longer scaled basses are sometimes favored for such styles since string tension is higher 

Standard bass guitars have four metal strings but models with five six or eight strings are also made The strings themselves are manufactured in different ways and with different materials to change their tonal qualities

In the 1960s and 1970s some musicians took the frets off their bass guitars taking the frets off a bass guitar changes the sound of the bass particularly as the player slides their fingers along the strings A bass guitar without frets is called a fretless bass guitar and are favored by some bassists for instance Pino Palladino whose performance on the fretless bass during the 1980s made him a highly desirable session player backing high profile musicians like Eric Clapton and David Gilmour While fretless basses are common with jazz and jazz fusion bassists from other genres use fretless basses such as metal bassist Steve DiGiorgio and Colin Edwin of modernprogressive rock band Porcupine Tree

The standard design for the electric bass guitar has four strings generally tuned E A D and G It is not uncommon for players to tune strings to a lower pitch particularly in styles such as heavy metal that favor deeper sounds Five string basses add a lower string usually tune to B while six string basses add a higher string tuned to C In standard tunings each string is tuned a perfect fourth interval above the next lower string 

Sounds are produced from the strings in a number of ways The most common form of playing is called fingerstyle in which the player plucks the fingers upwards with the ends of the fingers It is common to use the index and middle fingers as the plucking fingers but players may use more fingers or even employ their thumb to pluck downwards Other finger based techniques include slap and pop in which the player strikes the lower pitched strings firmly with their thumb and pulls higher pitched strings upwards and lets them snap against the fretboard and tapping in which the player hammers downward with their fingertips on the fretboard

Picks made of metal or plastic may also be used and generally yield a sharper sound than plucking with fingers Picking is sometimes combined with muting techniques to create distinctive sounds

The bridge of the bass guitar may be fitted with a tremolo which enables the player to vary the pitch of their strings while playing 

Where the strings are struck relative to bridge changes to the tone of the sound considerably Plucking or picking close the bridge generally produces a more muted note while sounding the string closer to the neck produces a fuller more resonant tone

Bass guitars also have magnetic pickups mounted on the body underneath the strings A musician plucks the strings with their fingers This makes the strings vibrate The magnetic pickups detect the vibrations Then the vibrations from the strings are converted into an electronic signal which is sent with a metal cable to an electronic amplifier and a loudspeaker The musician rotates a volume control knob that is located on the body of the bass to make the sound of a bass guitar loud or quiet

Saint Anna is the mother of Virgin Mary and the grandmother of Jesus Her husband is Saint Joachim Her name is a version of the Hebrew name Hanna

Nepali is the official language and there are many other regional languages English and Hindi are widely understood The capital city of Nepal is Kathmandu which has a population of over two million people The second largest city is Pokhara Pokhara has many lakes including Phewa Tal

Nepal used to be an agricultural country till 1950 Since 1951 it entered the modern era and has made progress Agriculture however is a major economic activity employing 80 of the population and providing 37 of GDP Only about 20 of the total area is cultivable another 33 is forested most of the rest is mountainous Rice and wheat are the main food crops The lowland Terai region produces an agricultural surplus part of which supplies the food deficient hill areas

Even though China is the 2nd largest exporter to Nepal yet unlike India which is the largest buyer of Nepals goods Chinas imports from Nepal are zero thus burdening Nepals monetary stability and monetary balance The annual monsoon rain or lack of it strongly influences economic growth From 1996 to 1999 real GDP growth averaged less than 4 The growth rate recovered in 1999 rising to 6 before slipping slightly in 2001 to 55

Modern education in Nepal began with the establishment of the first school in 1853 this school was only for the members of the ruling families and their courtiers Schooling for the general people began only after 1951 when a popular movement ended the autocratic Rana family regime and initiated a democratic system In the past 50 years there has been a dramatic expansion of education facilities in the country As a result adult literacy of the country was reported to be 482 in the Population Census 2001 up from about 5 in 195254 Beginning from about 300 schools and two colleges with about 10000 students in 1951 there now are 26000 schools 415 colleges five universities and two academies of higher studies Altogether 55 million students are enrolled in those schools and colleges who are served by more than 150000 teachers Despite such examples of success there are problems and challenges Education management quality relevance access are some of the critical issues of education in Nepal Societal disparities based on gender ethnicity location economic class etc are yet to be eliminated Resource crunch has always been a problem in education These problems have made the goal of education for all a challenge for the country

Terrence Stanley Fox was a Canadian athlete and activist He lost one of his legs to cancer at the age of 18 He is most famous for his run called The Marathon of Hope which began on April 12 1980 in St Johns Newfoundland the purpose of the run was to run across Canada about km to minum42abbrnospellCommonwealthprecision2wikiyes each day He originally wanted to run until he got to Vancouver Island on the other end of Canada The goal was to raise 1 million Canadian dollars and later one dollar for every person in Canada to help cancer research 

Many people supported and helped him during his run and had a lot of faith in him but on August 31 1980 near the town of Thunder Bay Ontario Terrys cancer resurfaced in his lungs He had to stop running 

Fox died on Death date and age19816281958728 exactly a month before his 23rd birthday He is considered a hero in Canada People still hold runs for him Shortly before his death he was made a Companion in the Order of Canada In addition there is a statue of him in Ottawa near Parliament Hill Several schools named after him and he has been featured on a Canadian 1 coin

Rick Hansen is a Canadian athlete and activist He was paralyzed in an accident at the age of 15 Inspired by his friend Terry Fox who tried to run across Canada after losing a leg to cancer he set out on a trip to travel around the world in his wheelchair it was called the Man in Motion tour The money he raised from that tour went to help spinal cord injury research and parapelgic sports He still works and does charity to raise money awareness

A kilobyte is a number used to measure storage space on computer hard drives or computer memory A kilobyte originally meant 1000 bytes Over time the meaning changed and today it is often used to mean 1024 bytes This created some confusion as a kilo should mean 1000 The International Electrotechnical Commission now defines a kilobyte as being 1000 bytes The correct name for 1024 bytes is a kibibyte

A byte is a unit of measurement One byte is usually equal to eight bits Technically some old computers had bytes with different numbers of bits An octet is always eight bits One byte can be any number from 0 to 255 Bytes are used when talking about the size of computer or other electronic data 

Byte is properly abbreviated as uppercase B 

Sometimes it is incorrectly abbreviated as lowercase b lowercase b is the abbreviation for bit For example MB means megabyte and Mb means megabit The difference is important because 1 megabyte is 1000000 bytes and 1 megabit is 1000000 bits Its easy to confuse the two but bits are much smaller than bytes so a lowercase b should be used when referring to bits and an uppercase B when referring to bytes

For large data byte is often used with a binary prefix

According to the International Electrotechnical Commission who sets many computer standards these charts show how bytes should be referred to

When using standard metric names like kilo mega and giga they should follow the same measure that other metric measurements use like kilometer for example

Since most computers are digital devices that are based on the binary numeral system rather than the commonly used decimal numeral system or binary coded decimal system there are many situations where the standard metric system does not work well particularly with USB drives and other types of flash memory or RAM If a memory or storage device uses a binary number for addresses the number of different positions to be accessed can be expressed as a power of 2 rather than a power of 10 

People who refer to 1 kilobyte as 1024 bytes for example are technically incorrect 1024 bytes should be referred to as 1 kibibyte according to the IEC 

A subatomic particle is a particle smaller than an atom This means it is very very small Like atoms and molecules a subatomic particle is far too small to be seen with the naked eye It is also very interesting to scientists who try to understand atoms better Some examples of subatomic particles are protons neutrons electrons quarks and leptons Protons and neutrons are made up of quarks which are smaller particles Electrons are examples of leptons

These particles are often held together within an atom by one of the four fundamental forces and outside of the atom the particles often move very very quickly near the speed of light which is very very fast Subatomic particles are divided into two groups Baryons and Leptons

Baryons have more things than leptons They have a given Baryon number In reactions the Baryon number must be conserved meaning that both the starting and ending sides of a reaction must have the same number of Baryons Baryonic particles are made up of a combination of the six quarks which are among the most basic particles The six quark types are up down strange charm top and bottom

Leptons are generally much smaller than Baryons This category includes electrons Muons Taus and neutrinos Leptons are not made up of quarks and are not divisible 

In addition to these there are also anti particles which have the same mass as their normal counterparts except they have the opposite charge Anti matter and matter cannot exist near each other Whenever matter and antimatter collide they destroy each other with a huge release of energy equivalent to Emc2 where m is the combined mass of the particles c is the speed of light and E is the energy produced These collisions often take place in large particle accelerators where the energy can turn back into matter by the same equation This can produce many odd particles that exist only for a short time

Most of the particles discovered are created by accelerating particles and colliding them against others creating huge showers of new subatomic particles which decay extremely quickly However because the particles are moving close to the speed of light they obey the law of special relativity and undergo time dilation This means that time passes slower for the particle and they can travel over a longer distance than scientists might predict

Breathing is the means by which our lungs remove carbon dioxide take in oxygen a gas needed along with glucose to produce energy The air going in and out of the mouth or nose when animals breathe is called the breath Without breathing you will die

CO2 must be removed because it is a waste product and is too much CO2 is poisonous

The air humans breathe passes into the two lungs which are protected inside the rib cage The lungs take oxygen from the air and pass it into our bloodstream Our blood takes oxygen all around the body When we breathe out the lungs get rid of used air Adults breathe about 18 times a minute which is more than 25000 times a day Children breathe even faster 

People who suffer from asthma or other breathing incidents that are dangerous often use an inhaler to help them The inhaler puffs a drug down into the windpipe This makes the air passages wider and then can breathe better than they could before

A baby is a very young human who is usually born after coming out of a woman A child is a month old a baby until he or she is about three years old and a preschooler between 3 years old and school

An infant is a human child at the youngest stage of life Some people say that infancy is until someone can walk while some say infancy is the time before the age of one An infant less than 1 month old is a newborn Newborns can be premature infants post mature infants and full term newborns The word infant comes from Latin meaning unable to speak

After learning to walk infants are called toddlers usually when they are 1 3 years old Sometimes a women may miscarry a baby and the baby is given the name stillborn or is called a miscarried child

A cactus is a kind of plant The plural of cactus can be cacti or cactuses or cactus In science all genera of cacti are named Cactaceae

Cacti first came from North America or South America Many people like to grow cactus in pots or gardens Now cacti have spread to many other parts of the worldThey are part of a very important food chain

Many cacti live in dry places such as deserts Most cacti have and sharp thorns and thick skin There are many shapes and sizes of cacti Some are short and round others are tall and thin Many cactus flowers are big and beautiful Some cactus flowers bloom at night and are pollinated by moths and bats Some cactus fruits are brightly coloured and good to eat Goats birds ants mice bats and people eat cactus fruits 

An adaptation is anything that helps a living thing survive and make more of its own kind Cactuses have many adaptations for living in places that are sometimes dry for a long time At other times these places can get lots of rain

Cacti can have many small thin roots near the top of the soil These roots take in water quickly after a rain The same cactus may have one long thick root called a taproot The taproot grows deep in the soil It can reach water when the soil on top is dry

Cacti store water in thick stems The stems are covered with tough skin and the skin is covered with wax The thick waxy skin slows down loss of water The leaves of cacti are sharp spines Many animals want the water inside the cactus but the sharp spines and thick skin protect the cactus

Cacti are commonly grown as houseplants They are pretty and easy to grow Some cacti are grown in gardens especially in dry areas Cactus can be used as a living fence The wood of dead cactus is sometimes used for building

People eat the fruit of some kinds of cactus such as dragonfruit and prickly pear Ciouvhiul insects also eat prickly pears These insects produce a red coloring used in food and lipstick

The ancient Aztecs of South America held cactus to be very important Cactus can be found in many of their sculptures and drawings The national coat of arms of Mexico shows an eagle a snake and cactus

Christopher Columbus brought the first cactus to Europe Scientists and gardeners became very interested in cactus

Prickly pears were taken to Australia in the 19th century for use as a natural fence and for use in the cochineal industry The cactus spread out of control Now it has made 40000 km of land useless for farming

From the start of the 20th century interest in cactus has grown Every year scientists discover new kinds of cactus A bad effect of this bigger interest has been the digging up of many cacti from the wild making some kinds endangered

A cactus does not have leaves because it lives in dry places Leaves transpire and this can waste water So the cactus saves water by having no leaves The green parts of the cactus are actually its stems Because the stems are green they do the photosynthesis for the cactus They also grow prickly needles to protect the cactus from animals that want to eat it

A desert biome is an area that receives less than 25cm of rainfall a year Deserts are found in the western part of North America Western Asia Central Australia and along the coast of South America There are hot deserts in Africa such as the Sahara with scorching hot weather during the day and chilly nights

There are also cold deserts in South America such as the Atacama which may have below freezing temperatures throughout the day and night Deserts are very dry places Most of a desert is made up of sand or snow sand dunes or snowdrifts and cacti or very small plants Deserts cover about 33 of the land on earth

There are hot deserts and cold deserts Cold deserts are covered with snow or ice Some cold deserts have a short season of above freezing temperatures These deserts are called tundra If the temperature of cold deserts remains below freezing year round they are called ice cap 

Cold deserts can be found close to the poles That is why they are also called polar deserts Other regions of the world have cold deserts too for instance high altitude areas like the Himalayas These are called montane deserts Antarctica is the worlds largest cold desert

 Hot deserts  Hot deserts can be covered by sand rock salt lakes stony hills and even mountains Most non polar deserts are hot in the day and chilly at night The temperature in the daytime can reach 50 C or higher in the summer and dip to 0 C or lower at nighttime in the winter 

The driest hot desert in the world is the Atacama Desert in South America In the Atacama Desert it did not rain for 401 years between 1570 and 1971

The largest hot desert of the world is the Sahara in North Africa It is almost as large as Europe or the United States The Sahara is also the hottest desert in the world

It does rain in the desert but not often In the Atacama Desert it did not rain for 401 years In other deserts it may rain every year or once every few years When it rains in a desert a lot of water may reach the ground in a short time Some rain passes straight into the dry sand but the rest may form a river Stream channels that are normally dry can quickly fill after heavy rains causing a flash flood

A sandstorm or dust storm arises when wind blows loose sand and dust from a dry surface Clouds of sand or dust are often so dense that they obscure the sun A sandstorm can move whole sand dunes

There are not many animals in the desert but some animals have learned to survive in various ways They have different ways to survive the intense conditions of the desert Examples of animals that live in hot deserts are lizards small rodents snakes and camels Plants and animals in hot deserts must live with very little water 

Xerophytic plants which live in the desert have special adaptations They may survive by growing roots that are very near the surface to absorb the rain that may fall before it evaporates Plants such as the cactus have thick fleshy stems that help them store water 

Animals such as lizards and small rodents often escape the hot rays by digging underground burrows where they live They only come out at night to search for food Like the plants desert animals must live on as little water as possible Most of the water used by these animals comes from seeds and stems that absorb and hold water Camels survive in hot deserts by storing water in body fat in their humps Like other desert animals the camel loses little water in wastes

A dessert is a type of food that is eaten after lunch or dinner It is usually a sweet food like ice cream cookies and cakes In some countries cheeses such as Brie cheese and fruit are served as dessert Some desserts are decorated like birthday cakes Others are simple like pudding Many desserts are baked Some desserts are served with whipped cream as a topping

Baked desserts are made by putting the ingredients in a hot oven Baked desserts include cakes and muffins sweet breads such as banana bread and raisin bread cookies such as chocolate chip cookies Puddings and custards can be made in the oven 

Fried desserts are made using a cooking process called deep frying To deep fry food a large pot filled with oil is heated and then the food is placed into the pot Deep fried desserts include doughnuts

Frozen desserts are made by blending the ingredients in a freezer Frozen desserts include ice cream milk shakes and sherbet

These are at the end of the domain name which has a period mark before it At first there were six main extensions

Today there are many other URL extensions These are usually either a top level domain or interest grouping Each country has its own top level domain for example ca for Canada us for the United States of America or couk for the United Kingdom Many countries have a government only extension for example the United States uses gov or fedus gcca for Canada and govuk for the United Kingdom Interest group domains would include tv pro and xxx These are not used as often as the original extensions

A cuckoo clock is a kind of clock Cuckoo clocks have a wooden case that looks like a small house and there are wooden doors that open It gets its name because at the start of every hour the small doors on the clock open up and a little wooden bird comes out of the door The clock then makes a noise which sounds like a bird call 

The clock makes the sound one time for each hour it is Whether it is morning or night does not change the number of times the bird makes the sound

The Labrador Retriever is a breed of dog

Labrador Retrievers are very gentle dogs with family friendly personalities They enjoy attention and exercise with their owner This dog is great with children They love to run around in big open spaces have a natural love of bringing things back and learn to retrieve easily They love to be active They like the water no matter what temperature outside as their coat protects them They are strong swimmers as they have webbing between the toes on their paws They come in five colors black yellow and chocolate or brown There are many different shades of yellow Labrador including a type that looks bronze or dark orange

This tough hardy breed of retriever is a great choice as a family pet They are playful easy to train and naturally obedient Labrador Retrievers do require regular amounts of daily exercise and are prone to obesity As a pet they can be demanding of attention and are best suited in a home where they can have a daily workout They like water and have a unique otter like tail which they use like a rudder when they swim

The origin of the Labrador Retriever is unsure due to the many different theories to how the Labrador as we know it came to exist A popular theory is that the Labradors ancestors were brought to Newfoundland by English fisherman These dogs were descendants of Newfoundland dogs brought to Europe and bred with Portuguese Water Dogs and other sports dogs

Although there is only one type of Labrador Retriever recognized by the CKC many Labrador enthusiasts will argue that there are actually two types of Labradors These can be broken down into the categories of English Dogs and American DogsLabs are fairly easy to train and make great family petsbut need to be acquainted with kids at an early ageThey are very energetic dogs

Margaret Hilda Thatcher Baroness Thatcher LG OM PC FRS was the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom She stayed prime minister from 1979 to 1990 Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990 she is often remembered by her nickname the Iron Lady She directed British troops in 1982 to recapture the Falkland Islands from Argentina Argentina had captured the Falklands for a short time during the Falklands War She had the second longest single prime ministerial term in history She married Sir Denis Thatcher they had twins son Mark and daughter Carol

She suffered from strong opposition during a miners strike in 1984 and 1985 which took away political power from the coal miners union There was also controversy when she tried to introduce a poll tax to Britain This caused rioting across the country The riots were one of the reasons she was replaced by John Major in 1990 In 1992 she became Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven joining the House of Lords

Thatcher is the only woman to hold the positions of Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader

Firefighters or firemen are people whose job is to put out fires and rescue people In a city the building they work in is called a fire station or fire hall Firefighters work for the fire department

There are firefighters in cities and towns who fight fires in houses and other buildings These are called structural firefighters There are also firefighters who fight forest fires and grass fires

In some places they are also taught first aid and given medical training so they can help people in other ways A paramedic or an emergency medical technician are names for people who have first aid training and usually work on ambulances paramedics and EMTs also work for fire departments Some work for other agencies such as ambulance companies or hospitals to ride on ambulances A lot of fire departments have ambulances to transport sick and injured people Fire engines in some places go to medical emergencies because they might be closer and can give first aid before the ambulance gets there A fire truck usually carries the same exact equipment as an ambulance does Search and rescue is also done by many fire departments

Firefighters have vehicles they drive fires and rescue operations If the vehicle pumps water it is called an engine If it does not pump water it is called a truck A rescue truck mainly responds to and has equipment for car wreckscollapsed buildingssearch and rescuestuck elevators and other thingsIf it carries the fire chief to fires it is a fire chief car Fire engines pump water and foam which is used to put out the fire Fire trucks carry ladders and tools to help rescue people from burning buildingsSome engines carry first aid kits to help people who are injured or hurt Fire engines can also carry tools and gear to rescue people from collapsed buildingscar accidentsstuck elevators and many other situations 

Firefighters must wear heavy clothing which protects them from the heat when they are fighting a fire This is called bunker gear or turnout gear

Random is a term used in mathematics as well as in a more general use for situations when there is no way to know the outcome Something that is chosen at random is not chosen for any special reason but purely by chance An example of a random act is a lottery

A computer can make lists of random numbers Humans are unable to do this because the brain works in patterns If someone is asked to keep saying heads or tails at random a computer would soon be able to tell which one the person is likely to say next because the computer notices the patterns

On a website such as English Wikipedia the user can click on Random page to get a random article The chances of any one page appearing are exactly the same as for any other page

Sometimes the word random is used more loosely There are websites of random jokes which just means a variety of jokes about all sorts of things

In recent years young people have started to use the word random even more loosely to describe anything which is rather strange or has no logic Sentences such as the mouldy cheese is escaping or I like pie and spam might be described as random although this is not the proper dictionary or mathematical meaning of the word

There are several ways in which a process or system can be seen as random

The many applications of randomness have led to many different methods for generating random data These methods may vary as to how unpredictable or statistically random they are and how quickly they can generate random numbers

Before there were computational random number generators generating large amounts of sufficiently random numbers required a lot of work Results would sometimes be collected and distributed as random number tables

Computers can make what appear to be random numbers There are two ways to make them

The Political status of Taiwan is a difficult situation that many people disagree about There are two countries in the world that call themselves China The Peoples Republic of China is the country most people think of when they hear the name China The Republic of China also calls itself China It is better known in most of the world as Taiwan

Taiwan was a part of China from the late 1600s After the First Sino Japanese War Taiwan and Penghu were given to Japan by China After World War II the Japanese on Taiwan surrendered to the Chinese This gave Taiwan back to the Chinese After losing a civil war in 1949 the ROC government fled to the island of Taiwan It took control of Taiwan and several nearby islands The PRC controlled mainland China It also said it will owned the island of Taiwan and the other islands The ROC said that it was the rightful government of China and it included all of China including Taiwan and Mongolia In 1971 the ROC lost its United Nations seat as China The seat was given to the PRC instead This made the PRC the rightful government of China internationally Most countries have accepted the PRC as the leaders of China Several countries including the United States have been careful to not say officially which parts of the original China are part of the PRC 23 countries have official diplomatic relations with Taiwan Nearly all of the other countries still have some diplomatic relations with them The major problems are about whether Taiwan is a still part of the PRC or should be an independent country 

People who live in Taiwan have different ideas Taiwan has not been ruled by mainland China since 1949 Today Taiwan is a democracy China is ruled by a communist government The idea of freedom in communism is different than how people in a democracy think freedom should be Few people in Taiwan want to become part of Communist China Almost none want to give up their idea of freedom Some people in Taiwan want Taiwan to formally become the Republic of Taiwan Most of the people in Taiwan want to keep everything like it is now They want to wait for the best time to become the Republic of Taiwan

Today most countries of the world see the PRC as China Most countries however still have a very close economic and cultural relationship with Taiwan 

The PRC believes that Taiwan is a part of the PRC The government of the PRC has said that if the people of Taiwan vote to become the Republic of Taiwan that they will invade Taiwan and stop this from happening In March of 2004 they passed a law that will allow China to invade Taiwan if Taiwan tries to leave the PRC and become an independent country This law has caused problems with the people in Taiwan It has caused even more people in Taiwan not to want to be a part of PRC China

Cellular respiration is what cells do to break up sugars into a form that the cell can use as energy This happens in all forms of life Cellular respiration takes in food and uses it to create ATP a chemical which the cell uses for energy Regular cellular respiration is aerobic but some simple organisms can only do anaerobic cellular respiration

The simplified formula for aerobic cellular respiration is 

C6H12O6 6O2 6CO2 6H2O Energy The word equation for this is Glucose Oxygen Carbon dioxide Water Energy

Aerobic cellular respiration has four stages Each is important but could not happen without those preceding it The steps of cellular respiration are

In glycolysis glucose in the cytoplasm is broken into two molecules of pyruvate Ten enzymes are needed for the ten intermediate compounds in this process

Biology textbooks often state that 38 ATP molecules can be made per oxidised glucose molecule during cellular respiration However this maximum yield is never quite reached due to losses as well as the cost of moving pyruvate and ADP into the mitochondrial matrix Present estimates are 29 to 30 ATP per glucose

Aerobic metabolism is 19 times more efficient than anaerobic metabolism They share the initial pathway of glycolysis but aerobic metabolism continues with the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation The post glycolytic reactions take place in the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells and in the cytoplasm in prokaryotic cells

Pyruvate from glycolysis is actively pumped into mitochondria One carbon dioxide molecule and one hydrogen molecule are removed from the pyruvate to produce an acetyl group which joins to an enzyme called CoA to form acetyl CoA This is essential for the Krebs cycle

Acetyl CoA joins with a chemical to form a compound made of 6 carbon atoms This is the first step in the ever repeating Krebs cycle which produces on each cycle two molecules of ATP and two of CO2 Because two acetyl CoA molecules are produced from each glucose molecule two cycles are required per glucose molecule Therefore at the end of two cycles the products are two GTP six NADH two QH2 and four CO2 The ATP is a molecule which carries energy in chemical form to be used in other cell processes

This is where most of the ATP is made All of the hydrogen molecules which have been removed in the steps before are pumped inside the mitochondria using energy that electrons release Eventually the electrons powering the pumping of hydrogen into the mitochondria mix with some hydrogen and oxygen to form water and the hydrogen molecules stop being pumped

Eventually the hydrogen flows back into the cytoplasm of the mitochondria through protein channels As the hydrogen flows ATP is made from ADP and phosphate ions

Lesotho is a small country in southern Africa Its population is about 1800000 The capital of Lesotho is called Maseru

Lesotho has no coast on the sea nor on a lake This type of country is called landlocked meaning it is surrounded by land All of Lesothos trade must either be flown in by aeroplane or brought in by land

If you look at a map of Lesotho you will see something unusual it is completely surrounded by the country of South Africa and has no borders with any other country This type of country is called an enclave Enclave countries are very rare but Lesotho is one This makes Lesothos relationship with South Africa very important to them both

Lesotho has many mountains and is one of the most mountainous countries in the world All of Lesotho is at least 1400 m above sea level People sometimes travel there to ski in winter The many mountains in Lesotho mean that it rains there a lot Lesotho uses some of its water to generate electricity and sells some of the water to South Africa

Lesotho became a country in 1818 but it was then called Basutoland A man called Moshoeshoe brought several of the groups of people in the area together and formed a new country with him as its king This new country came under attack from its enemies and in 1868 Moshoeshoe asked Queen Victoria of Great Britain for help Great Britain said it would help if Lesotho became part of the British Empire 

Lesotho eventually gained its independence on 4 October 1966 Now it is a member of the British Commonwealth King Letsie III is the ruler of Lesotho

Hamilton was not born in the United States He was from the Caribbean island of Nevis His father was named James Hamilton and his mother was named Rachel Fawcett Lavien Hamiltons mother had a child from a previous marriage that she left behind when she moved to Nevis At the time this meant that Hamilton was illegitimate since his mother and father were not legally married He was very sensitive about this fact

Hamilton graduated from Columbia University which was known then as Kings College He wanted to go to Princeton but was not accepted

Hamilton was killed in 1804 in a duel with Vice President Aaron Burr

Hamilton is shown on the face of the US Ten dollar bill He is one of only two non Presidents honored on commonly used notes

Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone is the first book in the Harry Potter series JK Rowling a woman from England is the writer It was published in 1997 and a movie version was shown in theaters in 2001 In the United States the book and movie are called Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone 

Because this is the first book about Harry Potter the author begins by setting the scene and introducing the reader to some of the characters who will be important through the books 

In the start Rowling describes how in an ordinary suburb somewhere in an English town people who are leading their ordinary lives are suddenly surprised to see witches and wizards in odd clothing riding on public buses and appearing at places where people would not expect to suddenly meet a wizard It is clear that something unusual has happened in the world of witches and wizards and those people who are normally quite secret are out and about enjoying themselves 

In this way Rowling introduces the two worlds of her story the world of ordinary people called Muggles and the secret world of the magic folk who usually keep to themselves Rowling then introduces the main character Harry Potter a little baby boy who is left on the doorstep of his aunt and uncle by an old wizard with a long white beard 

When the reader next meets Harry he has grown to be a boy of eleven living unhappily with his spiteful aunt cruel uncle and bullying cousin Dudley Suddenly he is rescued from his misery by a huge half giant man with a great black bushy beard and a flying motorcycle Harry Potter is a wizard without knowing it and the giant man Rubeus Hagrid has come to help him buy his books and get ready to go to school The school sounds most exciting It is Hogwarts Academy of Witchcraft and Wizardry 

On the long train journey north Harry Potter meets the two people who are to become his best friends Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger Ron and Hermione have very different characters Hermione who comes from Muggle parents is very intelligent and talented She is such a know it all and so bossy that the boys do not like her at first Ron on the other hand comes from an old family of wizards He is number six in a family of seven children He wears hand me down clothes and even his pet rat used to belong to his brother Percy Ron knows all about Harry Potter 

The reason that Ron and all the other people in the wizarding world know all about Harry Potter is that Harry is famous without even knowing it himself The reason why he was left on the doorstep of his aunt and uncle is that both his parents are dead They were murdered by an evil wizard who calls himself Lord Voldemort He is so evil that people are even afraid to say his name Harry is famous because he survived the magical attack of the He who must not be named and since that day Voldemort has gone into hiding 

Joanne Rowling then gives the reader a picture of the school that is to be Harrys home through seven books of the series each one of which deals with a year in his life The book describes the teachers the lessons the customs and the school sport so that it seems to be part of a real world Even though the students learn magic and use magic the book also describes Harrys growing up in a new and strange situation just as any student must learn to fit in when they go to a new school among different people 

Harry soon discovers that while some magicians such as the School Principal Professor Albus Dumbledore and Deputy Professor Minerva McGonagal can be kind and encouraging others like the sinister Professor Snape with his greasy black hair and nasty comments are very hard to trust One of the subjects that Harry really needs to learn is Defense against the Dark Arts but unfortunately the teacher Professor Quirrell is such a bumbling and nervous man that he does not seem to be able to teach Harry very much at all 

As the year goes by Harry discovers that Hogwarts has hidden away for safety a very precious treasure If it were to fall into the hands of Lord Voldemort it would be very dangerous indeed Harry also discovers that in solving problems and overcoming difficulties having friends with very different talents can be extremely useful

The movie made by Warner Brothers which was known as Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone in the US was based closely on the book

Libya is a country in north Africa Since 2011 its full name is The Libyan Republic The first mention of Libya in recorded history is by the ancient Egyptians The area is named after a woman written about in Ancient Greek stories Libya the daughter of Epaphus and Memphis In the past before it became a country Libya has been part of Carthage Rome Arabia and Spain It was ruled by the Ottoman Empire from 1551 until 1911

Libyas borders touch the countries of Egypt Sudan Chad Algeria Niger and Tunisia To its north is the Mediterranean Sea The capital of Libya is Tripoli which is a port on the sea Tripoli has about one million people Libya covers an area of about convert1760000km2mi20lkonabbron The highest point in Libya is Bikku Bitti 2267 m above sea level and the lowest point is Sabkhat Ghuzayyil 47 m at below sea level Most of the country is flat with large plains Because it is so dry only 103 of the land is suitable for farming

The area around Tripoli is called Tripolitania and it was the most developed during the Ottoman occupation

Cyrenaica is an area of the north east coast It is divided from Tripolitania by the Gulf of Sert It was named by the Greeks who built the city of Cirene in 630 BC The area was where many of the battles of World War II were fought It includes the cities of Tobruk and Benghazi Like Tripolitania Cyrenaica was also governed by Britain after the war

The Fezzan is an area of desert in south west Libya which the Italians made a part of Tripoli in 1912 After the war this area was governed by France who wanted to annex to their Empire

The population of Libya in 2011 was said to be about 6597960 This is not a large number for a country that has such a large area so the population density of Libya is low This is because much of Libya is in the Sahara Desert Most people in Libya live in cities on the coast People from Libya are called Libyans

Libyans are mostly Arabs though many are Berbers a group which includes the nomadic Tuareg of North Africa About 95 of Libyans are of Arab Berber origin Most Libyans are Sunni Muslims

Oil was discovered in Libya in 1958 and is about 95 of the countrys export income Oil is about 25 of Libyas GDP Other exports include natural gas salt limestone and gypsum Because so much of the country is desert Libya has to import about 75 of its food It does grow wheat barley olives dates citrus peanuts soybeans and many vegetables In 1984 a convert3862kmmi0lkonabbron pipeline was started to bring underground water from the Sahara to coastal areas for irrigation The pipeline which will take 25 years to complete has been estimated to cost about 25 billion It is called the Great Man made River and is the largest water development scheme in the world

The money of Libya is called the Libyan dinar It was made to take the place of the old money the Libyan pound in 1971 There are 1000 dirhams in a dinar Dinar is the name of the money in many Islamic countries The name comes from an old Roman coin the denarius

Libya is made up of three regions Tripolitania Cyrenaica and the Fezzan Tripolitania is the area on the north west coast once called the Kingdom of Tripoli It was ruled by Turks from the Ottoman Empire The USA went to war with the Kingdom of Tripoli in 1805 over the problems of piracy in the Mediterranean The USA had refused to pay increased protection money to the Turkish rulers 

Tripolitania and Cyrenaica were captured by the Italians during the Italian Turkish War of 1911 1912 The reason for the war was to set up a colony for Italy They said that this area was once part of the Roman Empire and belonged to Italy The Italians were the first country to use aeroplanes to drop bombs when they attacked Tripoli in 1911 

Many thousands of Italian settlers moved to Libya to set up businesses and farms which were going to supply food and produce for Italy and its Empire Libyans had some of their land in Cyrenaica taken from them by force and about 70000 people died during the battles starved or were decimated by the terrible epidemy of 1918 Many thousands escaped to Egypt but soon moved back when the Italian governor Italo Balbo started a friendly attitude toward Arabs 

Italian Libya enjoyed in the late 1930s a huge development with the creation of new railways ports hospitals airports roads In those years the agricultural economy boomed thanks to the creation of many dozens of new villages for Italian Arab farmers There was even an international race car competition outside Tripoli The war in 1940 destroyed most of what has been done by the Italians 

The British captured Tripolitania in 1942 during World War II and ruled it until 1951 

After World War II the regions of Libya were ruled by military governors from both Britain and France The United Nations made Libya an independent country the United Kingdom of Libya in 1951 This was to be a constitutional monarchy ruled by King Idris I and his successors Idris had been the Emir of Cyrenaica but went into exile in Egypt in 1922 At the end of the war he returned as emir with support of Britain He was also asked to be Emir of Tripolitania He was able to unite the three regions and became the king of the United Kingdom of Libya on 24 December 1951 The problems facing Libya were huge The country was poor with little in the way of goods to export Only 250000 people could read There were only 16 Libyan college graduates no Libyan doctors engineers pharmacists or surveyors The United Nations estimated that 10 of the people were blind from eye diseases especially trachoma Idris was a religious leader did not take much interest in the affairs of government His government was seen to be corrupt and did not take notice of an increasing rise in Arab nationalism which had brought Nasser to power in Egypt in 1952 Once oil was discovered Libya became one of the richest countries in the world Many Libyans felt that Cyrenaica was getting more of the oil money than the rest of the country A lot of the money from oil was also going to overseas companies

In the early morning of 1 September 1969 a group of military officers took over the government in a coup dtat Colonel Muammar Abu Minyar al Qadhafi was named as chief of staff of the military In January 1970 he became Prime Minister He began a political system named The Third Universal Theory This is a mix of socialism and Islam based on tribal government It was to be put in place by the Libyan people themselves in a unique form of direct democracy Al Qadhafi called this jamahiriya

Some of his first actions were to take back control of the oil and send the remaining Italian settlers back to Italy He also closed down the American USAF base

In 1977 Libya became Al Jamahiriya al Arabiyah al Libiyah ash Shabiyah al Ishtirakiyah al Uzma In English the name means the Great Socialist Peoples Libyan Arab Jamahiriya

Qadhafi used money from the sale of Libyan oil during the 1970s and 1980s to promote his ideas outside Libya He supported subversives and terrorists in other countries to bring about the end of Marxism and capitalism Beginning in 1973 he also started military operations in northern Chad to gain access to minerals He was forced to retreat in 1987 The Libyan government supported attempts to assassinate the leaders of Egypt Sudan Chad Tunisia and Zaire He supplied weapons and money to the Irish Republican Army during its fight with the British government in Northern Ireland In the 1990s the Libyan government said that it had been a mistake to get involved and would not supply the IRA any further It was said that Libya had also bombed aircraft including Pan AM Flight 103 over Lockerbie Scotland in 1988 and French UTA Flight 772 in 1989

The United Nations put sanctions in place against Libya in 1992 These sanctions stopped other countries selling weapons investing money or even allowing their people to visit Libya This isolated Qadhafi politically from the rest of the world and caused economic problems for Libya These sanctions were removed in 2003 when Libya agreed to meet several conditions They agreed to pay money to the families of people killed in the plane bombings They handed over two men believed to have carried out the Lockerbie bombing for trial They agreed not to support terrorism

In December 2003 Qadhafi said that he would end Libyas plans to develop weapons of mass destruction He also set about having normal relations with other counties Western European leaders and many working level and commercial delegations were able to visit the country He made his first trip to Western Europe in 15 years when he traveled to Brussels in April 2004

Every Libyan who is older than 18 can vote This means that voting in Libya is universal

In 2011 a civil war broke out in Libya when some Libyans started a rebellion against Colonel Muammar al Qadhafi and his government NATO gave the rebels help during the civil war The war lasted for eight months and it ended when the rebels killed Colonel Qadhafi and took over Libya

The population density of a country or city is a way of showing how crowded that place is It is calculated by dividing the population by the area For example France has a population of 60561200 and an area of 551695 square kilometres so its population density is about 1098 persons per square kilometre

A number of factors can affect population density For example the climate Greenland has a very low population density because it is very cold there so not many people want to live there

Many cities were built near rivers because the first settlers wanted somewhere close to water to start a society so you could say areas around rivers usually have a high population density

Some places such as cities have very high population densities so they are quite crowded The population density of New York City is 10292 persons per square kilometre Other places such as large countries can have very low population densities The population density of Canada is only 35 persons per square kilometre because it is such a big country

The United States Declaration of Independence is an important document in the history of the United States of America It was written in 1776 and says that the American colonies were no longer under the rule of Great Britain but were a new country

Before 1776 the United States of America was not a country The individual states were colonies of Great Britain They were called British Colonies This means that the King and Parliament of Great Britain ruled the United States The Declaration of Independence was signed by 56 men

During this time many American people were angry at Great Britain Many say Americans did not like paying taxes to Great Britain when they did not have any representation in Parliament The American people wanted to be treated like British citizens When they were not treated like citizens they felt that their loyalty towards Great Britain was no longer valid

Responding to actions taken by Great Britain including the Intolerable Acts the different colonies formed a Continental Congress to make decisions for all of the colonies They met in the American city of Philadelphia During a meeting of the Second Continental Congress on June 11 1776 they named John Adams of Massachusetts Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania Thomas Jefferson of Virginia Robert R Livingston of New York and Roger Sherman of Connecticut to form a committee to draft a document that would become the Declaration of Independence

Jefferson did most of the writing Jefferson writes of the rights of people and the role of government Jefferson then lists specific bad things that the government of Great Britain did like putting people in jail with no reason making taxes that were too high and not giving respect to people who lived in the colonies

The Declaration then says that because of all the things that Britain had done to the colonies the colonies would now be free independent states

After arguing about it and making some changes the Continental Congress approved Jeffersons document They used this document to declare their independence Independence was actually declared on July 2 1776 The full Continental Congress ratified the Declaration on July 4th at the Pennsylvania State House This version was only signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson On August 2 1776 a parchment paper copy of the Declaration was signed by 56 persons Many of these signers were not present when the original Declaration was adopted on July 4 One signer Matthew Thornton from New Hampshire who agreed to the Declaration and having joined the Continental Congress signed on November 4 1776 

The Declaration of Independence had many different effects One of them said that they were now not part of Great Britain It also said that all men were equal 

They made a new democratic government to govern America When the king of Great Britain and Parliament heard about this they were angry Great Britain and the people in America had already been fighting in a war This war is called the American Revolution America won the war and in 1783 Great Britain had to recognize the independence of the new country the United States at the Treaty of Paris

The people of America know that the Declaration of Independence is very important Every year on the day of July 4 they have the holiday that is named Independence Day They celebrate this holiday to remember the day that the Declaration was approved and the day that the United States of America became a its own countryNow we have parades fireworks and songs

Americans also know the Declaration of Independence is very important because it gives the simple ideas that the people who started the United States believed in It says that every person in this US has rights and that the government has to listen to our people These things are what makes America a free independent country

The Declaration of Independence is very old but it is still here The paper that Thomas Jefferson wrote on is now in the National Archives Museum near the National Mall in Washington DC

Judges in a court of law should not be prejudiced when deciding whether someone is guilty They should have an open mind so that they can make a fair decision For example if that person is the judges friend then the judge would be prejudiced because he would not want his friend to get into trouble

In many other situations it is important not to be prejudiced eg for an adjudicator in a competition or a juror in a jury

Inflation means that the general level of prices is going up the opposite of deflation More money will need to be paid for goods and services Economists measure inflation regularly to know an economys state Inflation changes the ratio of money towards goods or services more money is needed to get the same amount of a good or service or the same amount of money will get a lower amount of a good or service Economists defined certain customer baskets to be able to measure inflation 

When the total money in an economy increases too rapidly the quality of the money often decreases Economists generally think that this money supply increase causes the goodsservices price increase over a longer period They disagree on causes over a shorter period

The Demand Pull inflation theory can be said simply as too much money chasing too few goods In other words if the will of buying goods is growing faster than amount of goods that have been made then prices will go up This most likely happens in economies that are growing fast Whenever a product is bought or sold beyond its real price for its worth then Inflation of money occurs

The Cost Push inflation theory says that when the cost of making goods go up they have to make prices higher to still make profit out of selling that very product The higher costs of making goods can include things like workers wages taxes to be paid to the government or bigger costs of getting raw materials from other countries

However Austrian Economists think this is wrong because if people have to pay higher prices this just means they have less to spend on other things

Almost everyone thinks inflation is bad Inflation affects different people in different ways It also depends on whether inflation is expected or not If the inflation rate is equal to what most people are expecting then we can adjust and the cost is not as high For example banks can change their interest rates and workers can negotiate contracts that include automatic wage hikes as the price level goes up 

Problems arise when there is unanticipated inflation

nominal interest rate rise because inflation is anticipated

Obsessive compulsive disorder is a mental illness that causes repeated and unwanted thoughts and actions Anxiety is one of the most common symptoms and can lead the individual to believe that if a task is not completed something bad may happen Such a task may be washing hands five times This belief leads to more anxiety and tension OCD can limit ones ability to take part in relationships the workplace and in society in general

The causes of OCD are not fully known There seem to be certain predispositions as well as problems with certain neurotransmitters most notably serotonin Certain mutations of genes may also influence OCD Treating OCD is difficult because of this Drugs that influence these neurotransmitters sometimes help as well as drugs mainly used to treat depression 

Behavior therapy can teach those with OCD how to control it Often people are confronted with their obsessions and react less and less to them Use of drugs such as Prozac and Zoloft may also be prescribed by a physician to treat a patient with OCD Physicians may combine the use of medication and counseling for those with the disorder and they find that this approach works best

OCD affects around 12 of the worlds population and is affects the lives of around 15 In the United States about one in fifty adults has OCD

The Industrial Revolution is the name historians have given to the period in history when there was a large and rapid change in the way things were made This meant that instead of things being hand made in small workshops they were made more cheaply in large quantities by machines in factories 

Many people began to move from an agricultural based life in the country to the towns where the factories offered more and better paid work 

The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain in the middle of the 18th century It spread to Europe and the Americas especially the United States by the early 19th century As new inventions were being created factories followed soon thereafter England wanted to keep its industrialization a secret so they prohibited anyone who had worked in a factory to leave the country Meanwhile Americans offered a significant reward to anyone who could build a cotton spinning machine in the United States Samuel Slater who had been an apprentice in an English cotton factory disguised himself and came to America he reconstructed a cotton spinning machine from memory He then proceeded to build a factory of his own 

New ideas and inventions were also taken up and used in mining the working of metals and in the transportation of goods Around the same time the Agricultural revolution was also using new ideas in farming which left some farm workers without jobs They added to the move to the industrial towns where they sought out work in factories 

The most important new invention of the industrial revolution was the steam engine The steam engine invented by James Watt around 1776 was used to power the factories and pump out the deeper mines It was also used in railway engines The heat from burning coal became the main source of power

Some historians see the period called the industrial revolution as finishing about 1820 but they agree this was only the start of change in the way we make things which continues right up to the present time Many refer to the period after 1820 as the Second Industrial Revolution

Historians still disagree on why the Industrial Revolution happened when it did and why it happened in England first It built on a new spirit of studying things through science The 17th century was a period called the Enlightenment by historians during which people asked more questions about the way the world worked England also was a politically stable country throughout the 1700s with no wars at home England was also lucky that it had many of the raw materials needed to make and power the new machines close by within its borders It also had an overseas empire that would buy the goods it made and provide it with a cheap source of other raw materials such as cotton and sugar At the time of the industrial revolution slavery was practiced in many British Empire lands this supplied a source for some of the money which could be spent on building the new industries Also England had much less land that could be farmed compared to other European countries

Living standards rose and people generally became richer and healthier and had more children who survived to be adults This led a strong growth in the number of people in England However this caused new problems The environment was damaged The difference between the poor and the rich grew great Children and women had to work for a long time for little pay Often several families crowded into very small apartments Working at different times family members would take turns sleeping when they were not working Families were usually unable to get together 12 14 or even 18 hour workdays were common The Industrial Revolution brought problems of its own

Some of the things which happened during the industrial revolution were

Botswana is a country in southern Africa Its full name is The Republic of Botswana The capital of Botswana is Gaborone

Botswana is bordered by the countries of Zimbabwe South Africa and Namibia It is also possible to travel from Botswana directly into Zambia by crossing the Zambezi river by ferry

Botswana has no coast on the sea nor on a lake This type of country is called landlocked and means that all of Botswanas trade must be brought in over land or by aeroplane

The two most important geographical features in Botswana are the Okavango delta and the Kalahari desert

People from Botswana are called Batswana The population of Botswana is about 18 million people This is a small number for a country of this size and so the population density of Botswana is very low at only 27 persons per km This is because most of the country is desert and very dry

The languages spoken by most Batswana are English and the local language called Setswana

Botswana is a democracy and the people vote for their political leaders who vote for their president The current president of Botswana is Ian Khama

The economy of Botswana has been growing very fast since it became an independent country in 1966 The people of Botswana have had the worlds fastest growth in standard of living since that time

Botswanas economy comes mostly from the mining of diamonds as well as metals such as copper and of minerals such as salt Many people come to Botswana each year to see its wildlife and so tourism is important to the country

The currency of Botswana is called the Pula It is made up of 100 thebeOne US is about 68 Pulas 

A ferry is a ship or boat that is used to take people vehicles or goods across water Ferries are used across seas lakes and rivers Some places in the world can only be reached by ferry because they have no roads or railways nor any airports at which to land aeroplanes

Sometimes the trip in a ferry is free and sometimes it must be paid for

The word ferry can also mean to take someone or something by ferry

Microsoft has worked on Vista for more than five years so there are many things that are new to Windows It has new features like a thumbnail tab view so it is possible to see what a program is doing It includes many small programs which are called gadgets such as a calendar which the user can put events on and the computer will alert the user when those events are near The calendar is similar to the Bonzi Buddy program Some versions of Windows Vista have windows with title bars you can see through in a new addition called Windows Aero It has new things to prevent computer virus attacks and other problems that have been common with Windows Windows Vista is the first operating system for Microsoft to re word things to make it a lot more simple 

Microsoft have said that Windows Vista can run older programs but there had been some compatibility problems but a lot of companies had made newer versions of their programs and drivers so that Windows Vista is supported

Vista was released in November 2006 for system builders and January 30 2007 for home users The four main editions of Windows Vista are

There are 2 special versions called Home Starter Edition and Enterprise Edition Home Starter is basically the same as XP Starter and is for low budget countries Vista needs at least 512 MB of RAM to run on all computers Some new parts of Vista need 1 GB of RAM to work

For stability and performance more than 1 Gigabyte of main memory is always helpful with a large operating system such as this

Microsoft releases service packs to update software and fix problems

Windows Vista Service Pack 1 was released on February 4 2008 alongside Windows Server 2008 to OEM partners after a five month beta test period The first use of the service pack caused a number of machines to continually reboot rendering the machines unusable This caused Microsoft to temporarily suspend automatic deployment of the service pack until the problem was resolved The same release date of the two operating systems showed the merging of the workstation and server kernels back into a single code base for the first time since Windows 2000 MSDN subscribers were able to download SP1 on February 15 2008 SP1 became available to current Windows Vista users on Windows Update and the Download Center on March 18 2008 Initially the service pack only supported 5 languages  English French Spanish German and Japanese Support for the remaining 31 languages was released on April 14 2008

The Federal Reserve is a large central bank that loans money to other smaller banks The Federal Reserve Board is a group of financial leaders who work for the Federal Reserve and decide how much to charge these banks for borrowing money The Federal Reserve interest rate is decided by the Federal Reserve Board after studying the condition of the US Economy 

When the economy is growing too fast the Federal Reserve makes borrowing more expensive by increasing the interest rate which means people and companies spend less which discourages inflation When economic growth slows the interest rate is decreased so that borrowing will increase and there will be growth

Celsius sometimes called centigrade is a unit of measurement used in many countries to measure temperature This unit was created by Anders Celsius a Swedish astronomer

0 degrees Celsius is the melting point of water at what is called normal pressure 100 Celsius is the boiling point of water at normal pressure

1 C is therefore one hundredth of that difference

Since 1948 this unit has been called Celsius Centigrade was the name of the unit before the change 

The other commonly used measurement of temperature is the Fahrenheit scale

In 1742 Anders Celsius made a reversed version of the modern Celsius temperature scale In this scale zero was the boiling point of water and 100 was the melting point of ice In his paper Observations of two persistent degrees on a thermometer he wrote about his experiments He could show in his experiments that the melting point of ice was basically unaffected by pressure This was not the case for the boiling point of water It varied as a function of atmospheric pressure He proposed that zero on his temperature scale would be calibrated at the mean barometric pressure at sea level This pressure is known as one standard atmosphere In 1954 Resolution 4 of the 10th CGPM established internationally that one standard atmosphere was a pressure equivalent to 1013250 dynes per cm2 

In 1744 the year Anders Celsius died the famous Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus effectively reversed  Celsiuss scale when he received his first thermometer with a scale where zero represented the melting point of ice and 100 represented waters boiling point His custom made linnaeus thermometer for use in his greenhouses was made by Daniel Ekstrm Swedens leading maker of scientific instruments at the time Eckstms workshop was located in the basement of the Stockholm observatory As often happened in this age before modern communications numerous physicists scientists and instrument makers are credited with having independently developed this same scale among them were Pehr Elvius the secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and with whom Linnaeus had been corresponding Christian of Lyons Daniel Ekstrm the instrument maker and Mrten Strmer who had studied astronomy under Anders Celsius

The first known document reporting temperatures in this modern forward Celsius scale is the paper Hortus Upsaliensis dated 16 December 1745 that Linnaeus wrote to a student of his Samuel Nauclr In it Linnaeus told the temperatures inside the orangery at the Botanical Garden of Uppsala University

For the next 204 years the scientific and thermometry communities worldwide referred to this scale as the centigrade scale Temperatures on the centigrade scale were often reported simply as degrees or when greater specificity was desired degrees centigrade The symbol for temperature values on this scale was C Because the term centigrade was also the Spanish and French language name for a unit of angular measurement and had a similar connotation in other languages the term centesimal degree was used when very precise clear language was required by international standards bodies such as the Bureau international des poids et mesures The 9th CGPM and the CIPM formally adopted degree Celsius in 1948 For common people worldwideincluding school textbooksthe full change from centigrade to Celsius required nearly two decades after this formal adoption

Fahrenheit is a unit of measurement used to measure temperature The conversion rate to Celsius is C 59 x The degree Fahrenheit is abbreviated F

This temperature scale was made in 1724 by a German scientist named Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit In the twentieth century the unit declined in favour for the degree Celsius It is still used often in the United States In the United Kingdom Fahrenheit is encountered on some websites as well as some weather forecasts the main reason for this is because some of the older population are more familiar with Fahrenheit

The use of the degree Fahrenheit is in decline throughout the majority of the world with the USA being the main exception

The degree Fahrenheit is often considered to be old fashioned throughout the majority of the world as it is an older and outdated way of measuring temperature The degree Celsius has largely replaced Fahrenheits use as it is generally easier to use

Anthrax or splenic fever is a disease Both humans and other animals can get it It is caused by the bacterium bacillus anthracis It is common with even toed ungulates The spores of the bacteria can live for hundreds of years Humans usually catch the disease from animals It is usually not passed from one human to another Anthrax can be treated with antibiotics There is also a vaccine against it If not treated anthrax often leads to death 

There are 89 different kinds of anthrax One of them the Ames strain was used against the United States in 2001 as a biological weapon

On April 2 1979 there was a leak at one of the plants just outside of Sverdlovsk that made anthrax during the Cold War 94 people were affected and 64 of those people died The USSR blamed the deaths on another strain of anthrax that the people caught by digesting infected meat

At first investigators from the United States and others found the story believable During the administration of President Jimmy Carter the case was reopened US investigators searched and found flaws and shared their suspicions with the public The USSR denied it and still blamed it on the meat because of fear that they would be found out that they were making chemical weapons Making chemical weapons violated the treaty of Biological Weapons Convention and an investigation was immediately done by other countries to see if their suspicions were true or not

There were many cases of fake powder being found in envelopes

The KGB had conducted a very thorough cleansing or confiscating all surviving records from all hospitals and other areas with recorded accounts and descriptions of the anthrax The scientist made do and were able to track down survivors and people who witnessed the anthrax such as nurses in hospitals Their results showed that on the day of the incident all the victims were clustered along a straight line downwind from the military facility Livestock in the same area also died of anthrax After completing their investigation the team concluded the outbreak was caused by a release of an aerosol of anthrax pathogen at the military facility But they were unable to determine what caused the release or what specific activities were conducted at the facility According to an interview with Dr Kanatjan Alibekov former first deputy chief for Biopreparat the anthrax airborne leak had been caused by workers at the military facility who forgot to replace a filter in an exhaust system The mistake was realized shortly after but by then some anthrax spores were released Alibekov says if the wind had been in the opposite direction that day toward the city of Sverdlovsk the death rate could have been in the hundreds of thousands

To this day Western inspectors have not been allowed to visit this military facility

The French Revolution caused much fighting and disorder in France At times Napoleon was connected to those in power Other times he was in jail He helped the French Republic from those royalist who supported the former king of France In September 1793 he assumed command of an artillery brigade at the siege of Toulon where royalist leaders had welcomed a British fleet and enemy troops The British were driven out in December 17 1793 and Bonaparte was rewarded with promotion to brigadier general and assigned to the French army in Italy in February 1794

General Napoleon Bonaparte was later appointed by the republic to repel the royalists on October 5 1795 More than a 1400 royalists died and the rest fled He had cleared the streets with a whiff of grapeshot according to the 19th century historian Thomas Carlyle He was then promoted to major general and mark his name on the French Revolution 

The defeat of the Royalist rebellions ended the threat to the Convention and earned Bonaparte sudden fame wealth and the patronage of the new Directory In March 9 1796 Napoleon married Josephine de Beauharnais a widow older than he was and a very unlikely wife to future ruler

The campaign in Italy is the first time Napoleon led France to war Late in March 1796 Bonaparte begins a series of operations to divide and defeat the Austrian and Sardinian armies in Italy He defeated the Sardinians in April 21 adding Savoy and Nice to territories of France Then in a series of brilliant battles he won Lombardy from the Austrians Mantua the last Lombard stronghold fell in February 1797

In May 1798 General Napoleon left for a campaign in Egypt The French needed to threaten Britains empire in India and the French Directorys concerns that Napoleon would take control of France The French Army under Napoleon won an overwhelming victory in the Battle of Pyramids Barely 300 French soldiers died while thousand of Mamluks lay dead But his army is weakened by bubonic plague and poor supplies The Egyptian campaign was a military failure but a cultural success the Rosetta Stone was found by a French engineer Captain Pierre Franois Bouchard and French scholar Jean Franois Champollion was able to decipher the code in the stone Napoleon went back to France because of a change in the French government Some believe that Napoleon should not have left his soldiers in Egypt Napoleon helped lead the Brumaire coup of November 1799

Napoleon Bonaparte returned to Paris on October 1799 Frances situation had been improved by a series of victories but Republic was bankrupt and the ineffective Directory was unpopular with the French population He was approached by one of the Directors Emmanuel Joseph Sieys for his support in a coup to overthrow the constitutional government The leaders of the plot included his brother Lucien Bonaparte the speaker of the Council of Five Hundred Roger Ducos another Director Joseph Fouch and Charles Maurice Talleyrand The deputies had realised they faced an attempted coup Faced with their remonstrations Bonaparte led troops to seize control and disperse them which left a rump legislature to name Bonaparte Siyes and Ducos as provisional Consuls to administer the government

Though Sieys expected to dominate the new regime he was outmanoeuvred by Bonaparte who drafted the Constitution of the Year VIII and secured his own election as First Consul This made Bonaparte the most powerful person in France and he took up residence at the Tuileries

In 1800 Napoleon assured his power by crossing the Alps and defeating the Austrians at Marengo He then negotiated a general European peace that established the Rhine River as the eastern border of France He also concluded an agreement with the pope which contributed to French domestic tranquility by ending the quarrel with the Roman Catholic Church that had arisen during the French Revolution 

In France the administration was reorganized the court system was simplified and all schools were put under centralized control French law was standardized in the Napoleonic Code or civil code and six other codes They guaranteed the rights and liberties won in the Revolution including equality before the law and freedom of religion

In February 1804 a British financial plot against Bonaparte was uncovered by the former police minister Joseph Fouche It gave Napoleon a reason to start a hereditary dynasty In December 2 1804 Napoleon Bonaparte crowned himself Emperor of the French People of the French did not see him as the monarch of the old regime because his holding a Roman position that has the glory related to it He invited Pope Pius VII to see his coronation at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris During the ceremony Napoleon I took the crown from the popes hand and placed it on his own head This had been agreed on between Napoleon and the Pope before the coronation At Milan Cathedral on May 26 1805 Napoleon was crowned King of Italy with the Iron Crown of Lombardy

Napoleon I won support across class lines He encourage migr to return provided they oath of loyalty Peasants were relieved when he recognized their right to lands they had bought from Church and nobles during the revolution Napoleons chief opposition came from royalists and republicans

Among Napoleons most lasting reforms was a new law code popularly called the Napoleonic Code It embodied Enlightenment principles such as equality of all citizens before the law religious toleration and advancement based on virtue But the Napoleonic Code undid some reforms of the French Revolution Women for example lost most of their newly gained rights under the new code the law considered women minors who could not exercise the rights of citizenship Male heads of households regained full authority over their wives and children Again Napoleon valued order and authority over individual rights

Emperor Napoleon abandoned plans to invade England and turned his armies against the Austro Russian forces defeating them at the Battle of Austerlitz on December 2 1805 In 1806 Napoleon destroyed the Prussian army at Jena and Auerstdt and the Russian army at Friedland He crowned his elder brother Joseph Bonaparte as King of Naples and Sicily in 1806 and converted the Dutch Republic into the kingdom of Holland for his brother Louis Napoleon also established the Confederation of the Rhine of which he was protector

To legitimize his rule he divorced his wife Josphine and marry Marie Louise duchess of Parma and daughter of the Emperor Francis I of Austria Within a year she delivered a son and heir to the Bonaparte Dynasty He is named Napolon Franois Joseph Charles Bonaparte or Napoleon II and is crowned King of Rome from his birth

At Tilsit in July 1807 Napoleon made an ally of Russian tsar Alexander Romanov and greatly reduced the size of Prussia He also added new states to the empire the kingdom of Westphalia under his youngest brother Jerome the duchy of Warsaw and others states

The Congress of Erfurt sought to preserve the Russo French alliance and the leaders had a friendly personal relationship after their first meeting at Tilsit in 1807 But the relationship is short lived in June 23 1812 Napoleon went to war with Russia They defeated many Russian cities and villages but by the time they reached Moscow it was winterDue to the Russian armys scorched earth tactics the French found it increasingly difficult to forage food for themselves and their horses Napoleons army was unable to defeat the Russians The Russians began to attack Napoleon and his army had to go back to France The French suffered greatly in the course of Napoleons retreat He withdrew back into France his army reduced to 70000 soldiers and 40000 stragglers against more than three times as many Allied troops Finally at the Battle of Leipzig he is defeated by the Allies Britain Russia Austria and Prussia

Napoleon had no choice but to abdicate in favor of his son However the Allies refused to accept this Napoleon abdicated without conditions on April 11 1814 Before his official abdication Napoleon attempted suicide with a pill but it did not workfactdateApril 2010 In the Treaty of Fontainebleau the victors exiled him to Elba an island of 12000 inhabitants in the Mediterranean The Allies allowed Napoleon to keep an imperial title Emperor of Elba and an allowance of 2 million francs a year Napoleon even requested a 21 gun solute as emperor of the island of Elba Many delegates feared that Elba was too close to Europe to keep such a dangerous force

Separated from his son and wife who had come under Austrian control cut off from the allowance guaranteed to him by the Treaty of Fontainebleau and aware of rumours he was about to be banished to a remote island in the Atlantic Ocean Napoleon escaped from Elba on February 26 1815 He made a surprise march on March 1 1815 to Paris His former troops joined him and Louis XVIII fled to exile He again became ruler of France for a length of 100 days Napoleon was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo by the British under Duke of Wellington and Prussians on June 18 1815 which was his last battle Napoleon was again captured and taken to his second exile on the island of Saint Helena on the Atlantic Ocean

Napoleon was sent to the island of Saint Helena off the coast of Africa He died on May 5 1821 of stomach cancer Napoleon kept himself informed of the events through The Times and hoped for release in the event that Holland became Prime MinisterThere were other plots to rescue Napoleon from captivity including one from Texas where exiled soldiers from the Grande Arme wanted a resurrection of the Napoleonic Empire in America There was even a plan to rescue him with a primitive submarine For Lord Byron Napoleon was the epitome of the Romantic hero the persecuted lonely and flawed genius The news that Napoleon had taken up gardening at Longwood also appealed to more domestic British sensibilities

French people remain proud of Napoleons glory days The Napoleonic Code reflects the modern French Constitution Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained largely static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras but 18th century operational mobility underwent significant change Napoleons biggest influence was in the conduct of warfare His popularity would later help his nephew Louis Napolon to become ruler of France

On the world stage Napoleons conquest spread the ideas of the revolution He failed to make Europe into a French Empire Instead he sparked nationalist feeling across Europe

The surest way to remain poor is to be honest Ability is of little account without opportunityI can no longer obey I have tasted command and I cannot give it up Women are nothing but machines for producing children If you wish to be a success in the world promise everything deliver nothing In politics never retreat never retract never admit a mistake He who fears being conquered is sure of defeat Soldiers generally win battles generals get credit for them The best cure for the body is a quiet mind What is history but a fable agreed upon A picture is worth a thousand words

Lead is a chemical element Its chemical symbol is Pb which comes from plumbum the Latin word for lead Its atomic number is 82 atomic mass is 2072 and has a melting point of 3278C It is a very poisonous and heavy metal

Lead is a shiny gray blue poor metal It gets tarnished easily to a dull gray color It is soft and malleable It is very shiny when it is melted It is very heavy It is very corrosion resistant It is made stronger by adding antimony or calcium It can form an alloy with sodium It is toxic to people and animals when swallowed

Lead burns in air with a grayish white flame making toxic fumes of lead oxide Only the surface is corroded by air It dissolves in nitric acid to make lead nitrate It does not dissolve in sulfuric or hydrochloric acid It reacts with sodium nitrate to make lead oxide and sodium nitrite It reacts with chlorine to make lead chloride Lead oxide reacts with lead sulfide to make lead metal and sulfur dioxide

Lead makes chemical compounds in two main oxidation states 2 and 4 2 compounds also known as lead compounds or plumbous compounds are weak oxidizing agents 4 compounds also known as lead compounds or plumbic compounds are strong oxidizing agents Lead compounds are toxic just like the element The lead halides do not dissolve in water Lead oxide is the most common lead compound It is a black solid The lead oxides are all colored while the other salts are white or colorless Lead nitrate and lead acetate are the soluble compounds of lead

 FileLead 34330jpgLead found in the ground FileGalenajpgGalena Lead is found very rarely in the earths crust as a metal Normally lead is in the mineral galena Galena is lead sulfide Galena is the main lead ore

Lead was used for thousands of years because it is easy to get from the ground and easy to shape and work with The Romans used lead very commonly They used it for pipes drinking vessels and fasteners

Lead is made from galena Galena is made pure by froth flotation to get all the impurities out Then the lead sulfide is roasted in a furnace to make lead oxide The lead oxide is heated with coke to make liquid lead metal

Lead is used in the ballast of sailboats It is also used in weight belts for scuba diving It is also used to make shotgun pellets and bullets for small arms Some printing presses use lead type because it can be easily shaped It can be used outside because it does not corrode in water 

Most lead is used in lead acid batteries though The lead is oxidized making electricity Sheets of lead are used to block sound in some places Lead is used in radiation shielding Molten lead can be used as a coolant in nuclear reactors It used to be mixed with tin to make the pipes in pipe organs Different amounts of lead make different sounds

It is used in some solder It is used in covering for wires that carry high voltage Some tennis rackets have lead in them to make them heavier It is used to balance wheels of cars to make statues and to make decorative looks in buildings

Many lead compounds are used to make colored glazes in ceramics Lead can be used in PVC pipes Lead compounds are added to candles to make them burn better Lead glass has lead oxide in it Lead compounds are still used as pigments in some places Lead compounds were added to gasoline but are now outlawed Some lead compounds are semiconductors and are used in photodetectors 

Lead was used in many red yellow and white pigments in paints Lead was also used in pesticides Lead used to be used in pipes carrying water but now it is not because lead can leach into the water Lead cannot be used for shotgun pellets anymore

Although it can be safely touched exposure to lead should be avoided it is very toxic to humans and other animals when swallowed and its use is restricted in many countries 

If someone is exposed to lead for a long time it ruins their kidneys and gives them abdominal pains Lead also ruins the nervous system Lead paint was being eaten by children and they were getting lead poisoning

Joseph Smith Jr said that he had visits from God the Father Jesus Christ and many angels The first visit is called the First Vision It happened in the spring of 1820 when Joseph was 14 years old He had decided to pray about which religion to join He said that he went to the woods behind his familys house in New York prayed felt evil powers fighting him and was rescued when a bright light appeared above him In the bright light he said that he saw God the Father and Jesus Christ They told him not to join any church because none of the churches had all of the truth They also told him that they had work for him to do

Part of the work that Joseph did was translating the Book of Mormon Joseph said that an angel named Moroni visited him and showed him where a very old book was buried This book was written on pages of gold It was buried in a stone box in a hill near Josephs home Moroni visited Joseph once a year for four years until he told Joseph to take the Gold Plates Since the book was written in a very old language Joseph translated the book into English He did this with help from God and by the tools called the Urim and Thummim The book was published as The Book of Mormon in 1830 It tells the story of two main groups of people who lived in North and South America hundreds of years ago It also teaches many things about Jesus To members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints The Book of Mormon is a special book from God just like the Bible Mormons believe that by reading The Book of Mormon and the Bible people can learn how to get closer to God and how to find happiness in life This book is also the reason Church members are sometimes called Mormons

Today the center of the Church is in Utah but there are more than 13 million Mormons living all over the world The leader of the Church is called the president and Mormons call him a prophet They believe that God guides the prophet just like He guided Joseph Smith and the prophets in the Bible Mormons believe that it is important for families to spend a lot of time together and that after they die they can live together forever Mormons do not drink alcohol coffee tea or smoke tobacco They meet once a week on Sunday for church where they have the sacrament and listen to short talks or sermons They also have Sunday School to learn more The Church also has activities during the week Mormons also have buildings called temples These are the most holy buildings in their religion After a temple has been dedicated only Mormons that are living good lives can go in the temple

Today there are three main movements in Mormonism although one is by far the largest They are represented by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints the Community of Christ and the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message When people talk about Mormons they usually mean the followers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints which is the largest Mormon movement This movement also says that the term Mormon is a nick name given to members early in the churches history and would prefer to be referred to as Latter day Saints or LDS

Some people who call themselves Mormons are not part of the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints These people belong to other Mormon churches Some of their beliefs are different 

When Brigham Young became the second president of the Church after Joseph Smith was killed some people did not think he was the rightful president When Brigham Young lead most of the Mormons to Utah these people stayed in Illinois They believed that Joseph Smiths son should be the next president Today this church is called the Community of Christ It is the second largest church to call themselves Mormons They have more than 250000 people in their church

Other splits in the Church happened later The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints teaches that a man should only marry one woman This is called monogamy In the beginning of the church this was different A man could be married to more than one woman at the same time When the Church changed its position in 1890 some people left the official Church and continued with polygamy These groups are very small compared to the LDS The groups that did not want to abandon polygamy are sometimes still called Mormon even though in the official church polygamy has been forbidden since 1890 Most of these smaller groups stay away from other people since polygamy is illegal in the United States The LDS tells people not to use the word Mormon or pictures of Church leaders and temples when talking about these groups since it makes it seem like they are still connected to the LDS even though they are not

There are many practices in Mormonism that are very similar to those used in Christian movements There are some practices however where the Mormon movement is noticeably different from orthodox Christian movements such as Catholic Orthodox or Protestant faiths People who define Christianity as belonging to one of those demominations have to say that Mormonism is not a Christian movement

In English the LDS Church accepts the King James Version of the Bible as a part of its official scripture

In the beginning the Mormon movement said that it restored the Christian faith and that the other movements at the time held beliefs that were wrong In the 1830s the movement quickly gained members that had come from Christian movements Many Christians of the time saw the some of the practices and beliefs the Mormon movement held at that time as politically and culturally subversive The most controversial of these included the idea that slavery was wrong men being able to have more than one wife and the churchs wanting to run a government with laws based on Mormonism Some of these beliefs are no longer held by most Mormon movements today Such disagreements led to violent conflicts between Mormons and other Christian groups Even though there is not really violence anymore the movements unique doctrinal views are still criticized

Mormons believe in Jesus Christ as the literal firstborn Son of God and Messiah his crucifixion as a conclusion of a sin offering and resurrection However Latter day Saints reject the ecumenical creeds and definition of the Trinity taught by the Roman Catholic Church the Eastern Orthodox Church the Anglican Communion and Trinitarian Protestantism In their view the New Testament prophesied that people would turn away from Christian teachings and that there would be a restoration to the situation before the second coming of Christ 

Some imporatnt differences with mainstream Christianity include A belief that Jesus began his atonement from sin in the garden of Gethsemane and continued it until he was crucifixion rather than the orthodox belief that the crucifixion alone was the physical atonement In their view heaven is divided into three degrees of glory with hell being a temporary repository for the wicked between death and the resurrection Additionally Mormons do not believe in creation ex nihilo they believe that matter is eternal and that God organizes existing matter

Much of the Mormon belief system is oriented geographically around the North and South American continents Mormons believe the people of the Book of Mormon lived in the western hemisphere that Christ appeared in the western hemisphere after his death and resurrection that the true faith was restored in upstate New York by Joseph Smith and that the Garden of Eden and location of Christs second coming were and will be in the state of Missouri For this and other reasons including a belief by many Mormons in American exceptionalism Molly Worthen speculates that this may be why Leo Tolstoy described Mormonism as the quintessential American religion

Cider is a drink made from fruit juice most often from apples

In Europe and Oceania it is an alcoholic drink that is made from apple juice through a process called fermentation In the United States and parts of Canada cider containing alcohol is called hard cider or alcoholic cider while cider or apple cider means less sweet usually unfiltered apple juice

In the United States and Canada people drink a special kind of cider around Halloween and Thanksgiving This cider is usually unfiltered rather thick and it is often heated and spiced with cinnamon before drinking it This is different from the cider in Europe which usually is not heated

Usually to make cider apples with a high concentration of tannins are chosen The fermentation of the apples takes place at around 4 15 Celsius The temperature influences the duration of the fermentation The temperature at which the fermentation occurs also has an effect on the taste of the cider

Shortly before all the sugar has been fermented away the cider is put in a new barrel which is made air tight The rest of the sugar will then become carbonic acid This will also add to the life span of the cider

Cider is also the starting point for distilling Calvados This alcoholic drink is famous and very expensive

Cider is made almost anywhere where there are cider apple trees most notably

In France Normandy is the first region as to the production of cider apples and the first in cider production

In France some ciders can benefit from a protected naming This is the cidre normand and the cidre breton

France is the country in the world that produces the biggest quantity of cider

The United Kingdom produces the most varieties and along with Ireland holds the biggest market for cider

Hard cider contains alcohol which affects the taste of the cider This can be influenced by choosing the right moment when to stop fermentation

In France the most popular are the first second and fourth categories In the English speaking countries it is possible to find cider with up to 12 of alcohol

The French and Spanish cuisines have recipes where cider is needed to make them The French and Spanish also often drink cider instead of wine made from grapes

In Europe many young people drink cider Cider costs less than wine and is often served in pubs and other places where young people go

The effects of cider are the same as those of any alcoholic drink

Buffalo redirects here For the city in New York see Buffalo New York

Bisons are a group of even toed ungulate mammals They form the genus Bison of the subfamily Bovinae and the family Bovidae They are the biggest mammals in North America

Bison live in the northern part of the world The American Bison lives in North America and the Wisent lives in Europe They can also live in rugged areas

They live to be about 20 years old and are born without their hump or horns which both males and females have After shedding their light colored hair and with their horns they are grown at 2 to 3 years of age but the males keep growing slowly until about age seven Adult bulls are very dominant in mating season Adult bison usually have one or two baby bison

American Bison are large plant eating mammals that are similar to cows Even though they are often called buffalo they are not really related to them They used to wander around the prairies of North America in huge herds There used to be as many as 30 million bison in the United States but because of hunting by 1890 only 1000 bison were left Through conservation efforts there are now more American bison than there used to be but still far fewer than there were before the 1800s

Windows 95 added many new features to the last Windows operating system which was Windows 3x Windows 95 was the first Windows with the Start button Since then it has been used in all Windows operating systems

Windows 95 was Microsofts first operating system to support long file names Before that file names could only be eight characters long plus the file extension

Although Windows 95 is thought of as a full operating system it works over MS DOS Windows 95 is like a visual version of DOS This means that Windows 95 can run both MS DOS programs and Windows ones but programs made just for Windows 95 will not work in DOS

Windows 95 was also Microsofts first operating system to fully support CD ROMs though Windows 3x could also access CD ROMs

Prince Otto Eduard Leopold von Bismarck Schnhausen Duke of Lauenburg was a very well known aristocrat and statesman of the 19th century in Europe As Prime Minister of Prussia from 1862 to 1890 he was mainly responsible for unifying the many independent German countries and founding the German Empire in 1871 He became the first chancellor of the new Empire

He was Graf von Bismarck Schnhausen in 1865 then since 1871 Frst von Bismarck and since 1890 the Herzog von Lauenburg First he did not want the duke title but accepted it later

Bismarck was very conservative and he was strongly connected to the monarchy He was not a big supporter of democracy His most important goal was to make Prussia stronger and he achieved that through the unification of Germany Bismarck tried to stop the socialist movement and to reduce the power of the Catholic Church One way to stop socialism was to make the working class happy He did that by introducing many social reforms like public health and accident insurance as well as pensions for old people

Differential calculus a branch of calculus is the process of finding out the rate of change of a variable compared to another variable by using functions It is a way to find out how a shape changes from one point to the next without needing to divide the shape into an infinite number of pieces Differential calculus is the opposite of integral calculus It was developed in the 1670s and 1680s by Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz

Unlike a number such as 5 or 200 a variable can change its value For example distance and time are variables At an Olympic running race as the person runs their distance from the starting line goes up Meanwhile a stopwatch or clock measures the time as it goes up We can measure the average speed of the runner if we divide the distance they travelled by the time it took But this does not say what speed the person was running at exactly 15 seconds into the race If we had the distance at 1 second and the distance at 2 seconds we would still only have an average although it would probably be more correct than the average for the whole race

Until calculus was invented the only way to work this out was to cut the time into smaller and smaller pieces so the average speed over the smaller time would get closer and closer to the actual speed at exactly 15 seconds This was a very long and hard process and had to be done each time people wanted to work something out Imagine a driver trying to figure out a cars speed using only its odometer and clock without a speedometer

So we know without having to draw any tangent lines that at any point on the curve f x the derivative f will be 2x at any point This process of working out a slope using limits is called differentiation or finding the derivative

Using the above system mathematicians have worked out rules which work all the time no matter which function is being looked at

A Socialist country is a country where the government or the public as a whole has control over the economy In a socialist country the producing and dispersing of goods is owned by the government Socialism is placed in between capitalism and communism 

A hamster is a small furry animal that is a bit like a mouse or a ferret Wild hamsters live in the desert but people all over the world keep domesticated hamsters as pets There are four main types of hamsters the Syrian hamster the Russian dwarf hamster the Chinese hamster and the Roborovski hamster All Syrian hamsters are the descendants of 12 baby hamsters found in Syria in 1930 

Pet hamsters like to live in cages with wood shavings recycled newspaperno fluffy bedding as this Is dangerous plain toilet aper is a cheaper safer option straw on the bottom and eat mostly hamster food sold at a pet store but they also eat almost any vegetables and fruits in very tiny portions Hamsters store food in the sides of their mouths They cannot eat oranges lemons watermelons grapes candy or garlic They need a water bottle with fresh water to drink from and something to chew on to trim their teeth because they grow constantly If they do not like chewing you will have to cut their top teeth Wooden blocks and some hard foods can be used for this Toilet paper rolls and pieces of cardboard are not advised as the hamster may choke or try to eat it Most hamsters also have a wheel to run on for exercise although some people get other kinds of exercise equipment for their hamsters like an empty ball that the hamster can roll around the floor or a long network of tubes with air holes for it to crawl through When using the hamster ball let the hamster roll in it for 10 to 15 min for they might over tire and die They should live in an aquarium or cage meant for hamsters You should not use a mouse case because hamsters can squeeze through many small spaces When letting your hamster out always keep an eye on it Hamsters may look slow but are truly very fast Keep your hamster away from any electric wires since they like to chew on them Hamster are not recommended for young children

Edward Theodore Ed Gein was an American serial killer While Gein was found guilty of only two murders the actual number is not known Gein is considered by many to be even more well known because of several movies that were based in part on him He was also known as The Butcher of Plainfield The Plainfield Butcher The Mad Butcher and The Plainfield Ghoul

Ed Gein and his brother Henry were raised by their mother on their 160 acre farm near Plainfield Wisconsin She was a very religious woman and was very protective about her boys She kept them away from women and busy with farm work

His alcoholic father died in 1940 A few years later his brother Henry died in 1944 officially while fighting a grass fire Soon after that his mother had her first stroke In 1945 she had her second stroke and died Ed was left alone

Gein then closed off the upstairs and the parlour of the house as well as his mothers bedroom He lived in the one other bedroom kitchen and shed of the large house He stopped working the farm because a government program paid him a subsidy He also made money by doing small jobs for people in the area

Ed read books on human anatomy and Nazi concentration camp experiments He was very interested in it all especially the female anatomy He thought about sex often One day he saw a newspaper article of a woman who had been buried that day

He asked an old friend named Gus to help him Gus was very strange too Gus agreed to help Gein open a grave to get a corpse Gein told him it was for medical experiments The first corpse came from a grave very near the grave of Geins mother

Gein continued to do this for the next ten years He would check the newspaper often for fresh bodies He always went to the graveyard at the time of a full moon Gein would take the whole female corpse or just the parts he wanted put the dirt back in the grave and take home what he took from the grave

Gein did many strange things with the dead bodies He would build objects from the bones and skin The organs would be put into the refrigerator to eat later It was claimed that he also had sex with the bodies a charge he denied because they smelled too bad He even dug up his own mothers corpse

Gein did not tell Gus that he wanted to become a woman himself This was the reason he had studied anatomy He thought about the broken wikt linkpossibilitypossibilities of an operation which would change his sex He wanted to study a female corpse and learn more about its anatomy The closest he would get to changing his sex was dressing up in his full woman bodysuit This bodysuit was made entirely of human skin It completely covered his body and included a mask and breasts

Later Gus was taken away to an asylum and Gein was all alone again Gein thought that fresher bodies would be better for his collection and turned to murder

Ed Geins first victim was Mary Hogan a 51 year old divorcee and the owner of a local tavern in Pine Grove six miles from his home On the afternoon of December 8 1954 he shot her in the head with his 32 caliber revolver He put her body in his pickup truck and took her back to his shed

A customer who dropped into the tavern found the place deserted and a large bloodstain on the floor A spent 32 cartridge lay near it Bloodstains ran out the back door and into the parking lot where they halted beside tire tracks that looked like those of a pickup truck It looked as if Mary Hogan had been shot and taken away

Police were not able to learn anything about what happened to her A few weeks later a sawmill owner named Elmo Ueeck talked to Gein about it Gein replied She isnt missing shes at the farm right now Ueeck did not ask him what he meant by that

There may have been other victims in the years that followed Nothing is known for certain about Gein until November 16 1957 when he shot killed Bernice Worden in her store in Plainfield He used a 22 rifle from a rack in the store and his own bullet which he carried with him He then locked the store and took the body home in the stores truck Gein also took the cash register He later explained that he did not take it to commit robbery He wanted to see how it worked and planned to return it later

Bernice Wordens son Frank often worked with her in the store That morning he had gone deer hunting When he got back he saw that the store was closed with the lights still on and his mother was missing He also saw that the cash register was gone and there was blood on the floor

Frank Worden talked to the sheriff Art Schley and told him what he has seen He checked the record of sales made that morning One of them was for half a gallon of antifreeze Worden remembered that Ed Gein had stopped by the night before at closing time He had said that he would be back the next morning for antifreeze Ed had also asked Worden if he was going hunting the next day

With the cash register missing he thought that Gein had planned a robbery once he learned Frank would not be there Worden told this to the sheriff The sheriff and captain Lloyd Schoephoester went to the farm seven miles outside Plainfield

The house was dark and Ed Gein was not there when the police arrived They drove to a store where Gein usually bought groceries where they found Gein who was just about to leave in his truck

The sheriff stopped him and asked him to get into the police car for questioning Sheriff Schley had not said anything about Bernice Wordens death before Gein said that he thought someone had tried to frame him for the death at which point Schley arrested Gein 

Sheriff Schley Captain Schoephoester went back to Geins house with other officers The doors to the house were locked but the door to the shed behind the house was not Inside they found a naked corpse of a woman hanging upside down from a crossbeam The legs were spread wide apart and there was a long cut from the genitals almost to the throat The throat and head were missing The genitals and the anus were also missing Bernice Worden had been cut open dressed out like a deer

There was no electricity in the dark house They had to search it with oil lamps lanterns and flashlights The place looked like it had not been clean in years The few rooms that were not nailed shut were full of books old papers magazines utensils tin cans cartons and other junk

In the house they found

The bodies of 15 different women had been used to create Geins trophies It is also said that sometimes Gein brought gifts of fresh venison to his neighbours but Gein said he had never shot a deer in his life

Gein was sent to the Central State Hospital for the Criminally insane He was proven insane The doctors thought that he loved his mother but he hated her so that is why he killed older women It is said that Mary Hogan looked similar to his mother

Gein said he was not a cannibal or necrophiliac He did admit to grave robbing

Many people became interested because of the true nature of the crime Thousands of people drove to Plainfield to look at the murder farm Eventually the place was burned down by the Plainfield citizens as they felt it as a place of evil

At Christmas 1957 Gein was judged insane He was committed to Waupan State Hospital for the rest of his life Gein died of cancer on July 26 1984 at the age of 78 He was buried in Plainfield next to the graves of his family

Because of the true nature of Geins crimes Hollywood had a lot of ideas to work on

The movie Psycho was based on the Robert Bloch book and made into a Hitchcock movie Bloch got most of the ideas for Psycho from Ed Geins life With the overpowering mother and horror of the movie it was one of the first of a kind

The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was based in some parts on Ed Gein The story is about a group of teens who go to a horror house The people that live in the house are a family of strange homicidal cannibals who also like grave robbing and building furniture made of bones and skulls The lead bad guy is called Leatherface Leatherface likes chasing teens around with his chainsaw and wearing a mask made from the faces of his victims

The Academy Award winning movie The Silence of the Lambs also uses part of Geins life It is about an FBI agent who is tracking down a serial killer To find him she must get the help of an intelligent cannibal Dr Hannibal Lector The serial killer she is trying to catch is called Buffalo Bill He likes to kill women and make clothes of their skin He also wants to be a woman and made a skin costume like that of Gein

Easter also called Resurrection Day is a holiday Among Christians it is a celebration of Jesus Christ returning from the dead Christians believe that it is the holiest day in the year People who are not Christians celebrate it as the beginning of Spring

Easter is not held on the same date every year Currently all Christian churches agree on how the date is calculated Easter is celebrated on the first Sunday following the first full moon after the Spring Equinox This means it is celebrated in March or April Western churches like the Roman Catholic Church use the Gregorian calendar while Eastern churches like the Eastern Orthodox Church use the Julian calendar Because of this the date of Easter celebrations is different for these two types of churches even though the way they calculate the date is the same

Some Christians do not use the word Easter because it comes from Eastre the Goddess of Spring in paganism The French word for Easter Pcques comes from the Greek word for Passover which is the Jewish holiday celebrated at the same time of the year

Christians believe that Jesus was killed on the cross about 2000 years ago by the Romans in a city called Jerusalem The people who killed him did so because they believed that he was causing trouble for the government and because he was claiming to be the Messiah When they crucified him they even hung a sign over his head which said King of the Jews The day he was crucified is known by Christians as Good Friday

Christians believe that on the Sunday after Jesus was killed some of his followers found that his body was no longer in the tomb where he was laid Later Jesus is said to have appeared to over 500 people and preached to them The New Testament teaches that the resurrection of Jesus is what Christianity is based on The resurrection made people believe that Jesus was the powerful Son of God It is also spoken of as proof that God will judge the world fairly Christians believe that God has given Christians a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead Christians believe that through faith in God they are spiritually made alive with Jesus so that they may lead a new life

Today people celebrate Easter in a number of different ways they give each other or hide to have children find colourful Easter eggs they also give each others candy Sometimes they even give each other baby ducks chickens or bunnies as presents though this is not done as much as it used to be These ways of celebrating have nothing to do with Christianity They come from the spring celebrations from old European nature religions Christians and even some people who are not Christians dress very nicely and go to church on Easter Sunday Large dinners are usually held on Easter afternoon as well A ham is often at the center of this dinner and hot cross buns are sometimes served

Agnosticism is the philosophical view that it is unknown whether any deities exist or not Some people who call themselves agnostic say that it is not possible for anyone ever to know if there are any deities or not Other agnostics though say only that they themselves currently do not know if there are any deities

There are several different kinds of agnosticism

People often have difficulty telling agnosticism and atheism apart Atheists do not have a belief in the existence of deities and some claim to be quite sure that no deity exists Some atheists though state that it is up to theists or those who believe in a deity to give the evidence for a god or to show why someone should believe in a god They state that there is neither enough evidence nor a strong enough argument to believe any gods exist and so they reject belief that any exist While agnostics think we cannot know for sure whether any deities exist some agnostics do believe at least one deity exists These people are both agnostic and theistic they believe at least one deity exists but do not claim to know that to be true Some people are both atheist and agnostic they reject belief in any deities without claiming to know that deities do not exist Some agnostics just cannot themselves decide whether to believe any deities exist or not

For the US State please see Georgia

Georgia is a country in the Caucasus on the edge of the Black Sea During 1991 1995 its full name was the Republic of Georgia but since 1995 it is Georgia as written in the Constitution It used to be part of the Soviet Union but now it is an independent republic

Georgia is next to the countries of Russia Turkey Armenia and Azerbaijan It also has a coast on the Black Sea It lies at the edge of Europe and Asia

Georgia has many mountains Its highest point is 5048 m above sea level The mountains running through Georgia are called the Caucasus Mountains

The capital of Georgia is called Tbilisi

The population of Georgia is about 45 million About 13 million of these live in Tbilisi People from Georgia are called Georgians Most of them speak Georgian as their first language though some people also speak Armenian Russian or other languages The most famous person to have come from Georgia is Josef Stalin

Most Georgians are Christians but there are some Muslims and Jews as well

The currency of Georgia is called the lari

The Georgians are an ancient people Their Capital Tbilisi was founded around AD 400 after the end of the Roman Empire Western Georgia was part of the Roman empire before then The Arabs captured it in 635 AD The culture continued and they flourished through trade In the 900s Arabs were weaker and the Georgians became their own country again It was the major country in the region until the Mongols invaded in 1223 Georgia was part of the Mongolian empire for a century on and off until 1334 when King Giorgi V took over In the 1500s the Persians invaded Georgia four times from 1541 1544 In 1555 the Kings of Kartli ruled through the will of the will of the Persian shahs In 1783 The treaty of Georgievsk was signed between Catherine the Great of Russia and King Herekle giving Russia the power to protect Georgia Then in 1798 the Persians burned Tbilisi to the ground From 1811 to 1918 Georgia was under the Tsar of Russia Their culture survived intact From 1918 to 1921 Georgia was independent and then was part of the Soviet Union In 1991 Georgia declared their independence and they have been their own country ever since There was a rough patch between 1994 and 1995 when the economy was poor but now Georgia is a country with close ties with the United States They are currently applying to NATO

A first person shooter is a computer or video game where the player sees the level from the eyes of the character being played

These games are also called FPS for short Lots of them are violent and about killing other game characters Because they are from the view of the character a player can only see his or her hands and weapon

Usual signs that a game is an FPS is that the player can see

Some FPSs are for example

Random access memory is the memory or information storage in a computer that is used to store running programs and data for the programs Data in the RAM can be read and written quickly in any order Normally the random access memory is in the form of computer chips Usually the contents of RAM are accessible faster than other types of information storage but are lost every time the computer is turned off

There are several types of RAM used in modern computers Prior to 2002 most computers used single data rate RAM Most computers made since use either double data rate DDR2 or DDR3 RAM DDR2 allows stored data to be moved and used more quickly than DDR so that the computers processor can keep working quickly without having to wait for data as long or as often and DDR3 technology works even faster

Different kinds of RAM usually will not work together in the same computer Most computers can only use one kind of RAM Some can use a small number of different kinds Different kinds of RAM often have differently shaped connectors This limits which RAM chips a particular computer model can use

Information that the computer always needs that does not often change is normally kept in read only memory which does not lose its contents when the computer is turned off Such items include the BIOS which stores the most basic commands for the computer telling it how it should start up The BIOS also tells the computer how to input and output information The BIOS can be compared to the part of your brain that tells your heart how to beat This is an important part

Read only memory is a type of computer memory Unlike RAM it keeps its contents even when the computer or device is turned off Usually ROM cannot be written to when the computer runs normally ROM is used for important programs like the BIOS which tells the computer how to start or the firmware of certain devices which usually does not need to be modified Usually ROM comes on computer chips

There are different kinds of ROMs

An integrated circuit is a piece of specially prepared silicon into which a very complex electronic circuit is etched using photographic technique Silicon chips can contain computer processors memory and special devices The chip is very fragile and so is normally surrounded by a tough plastic package and electrical contact with the chip are provided through metal legs sticking out of the package There are two main advantages of ICs over discrete circuits cost and performance Cost is low because the ICs are printed as a complete unit by photolithography and not constructed as one transistor at a time Performance is higher since the components switch quickly consuming little power ICs work as they are designed Lets suppose that you designed a chip as a calculator which only works as a calculator

An integrated circuit was independently co invented by Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce around the same time in late 1950s

The difference between VLSI and ULSI is obscure

Integrated circuits can be classified into DIP PLCC TSOP PQFP and etc by chip package type

Mosses do not have cells that move water like other plants water must soak into them like a sponge A patch of moss is made of many tiny moss plants packed together so that they can hold water for as long as possible They do not have roots and could not get water from them if they did Because they cannot find water they live in two ways They can live in places that are always wet like near a spring a river or in a place where there is a lot of fog They can also dry up when there is no water This means that they can never live in dry places 

They cannot grow very large because they could not move water to the top of the moss The largest moss grows in New Zealand and is about 30 cm tall 

A moss does not make seeds A moss does not have fruit The green fuzzy part of a moss that is always there has only half of the moss DNA When the moss has made lots of food and there is enough water cells from different moss plants swim inside a clump of moss Two cells combine to make a cell with a full set of moss DNA This cell grows into a different kind of moss plant but it gets all of its food from a green fuzzy moss plant When the cell grows it makes tiny spores instead of seeds The spores are like dust They come from a little box that grows up out of the moss The box has a lid that falls off Then the spores come out and float away They will make more moss

Scientists divide the mosses into eight groups Five of these groups are small with just a few species most mosses are in the group called Bryopsida

In mathematics a function is the idea that one quantity completely determines another quantity often called the output Modern mathematics defines functions using sets A function can then be seen as a rule With this rule each element of the set of inputs will be assigned one element of the set of outputs Even though the underlying structures are sets mathematicians talk about domain and codomain of a function Each element of the domain will be associated with one element of the codomain

An example of an elementary function that acts on the real numbers as both the domain and the codomain could be f 2x Every real number will be assigned a real number that is twice as big In this case f 10

This was used in schools until the second half of the 20th century In the 19th century Weierstra Dedekind and others worked on the theory of limits When they did they discovered that the limit of infinite sequences are sometimes not continuous and that they can sometimes not be expressed as a closed formula with a finite number of rules This meant that the concept of function had to be extended

When people write functions they often write f but the f can also be written with any letter in the alphabet and sometimes with greek letters This can look confusing but just means they are different to another function in the same working out or formulae or can mean that they are special functions like the Riemann Zeta function which is spelt as Moreover g is often used for the first reason but not always

There are other functions In mathematical language a function can be defined as a map from a non empty set to a non empty set such that for every element in the domain there is a single corresponding element in the codomain

Inverse functions are where the action of a normal function are reversed The symbol for this is is f 1 For example think of fx2 this reversed is f 1x

Grunge music or Seattle sound is a style of rock music that has elements of punk rock and heavy metal It started in the early 1980s in the Pacific Northwest of the United States especially in the states of Washington and Oregon It became more popular in the early 1990s Grunge songs often had lyrics with nihilism depression unhappiness or apathy as themes The widespread use of heroin as a recreational drug found its way into the lyrics and careers of numerous grunge rockers notably Kurt Cobain and Layne Staley of Alice in Chains 

The songs often had light guitar sounds in the verses and the high energy boost of distorted guitars in the choruses The line up for these bands was the typical rock band of guitars bass drums and vocal

Although grunge as a movement became less popular by the last 1990s its influence is still heard in many bands today

Some well known grunge artists were

Eritrea became an independent country on 24 May 1993 It is one of the newest countries in the world

Many different countries have ruled the land that is now called Eritrea Between 1885 and 1941 it was a colony of Italy Between 1941 and 1952 the United Nations put it under the protection of United Kingdom After 1952 Eritrea became a part of Ethiopia This was the reason for a long civil war between the Eritreans and the government of Ethiopia

Queen Liliuokalani did not want her people to be harmed so she agreed to do what the revolutionists wanted The Queen went to Washington and talked to the American President Grover Cleveland Cleveland decided that this had been an act of war against the Hawaiian Kingdom Cleveland ordered Sanford Dole the President of the newly formed republic to make Liliuokalani the queen again 

Dole refused to do this He said that President Cleveland was interfering Dole remained the president of Hawaii from 1894 until 1900 after Cleveland was elected out of office The newly elected American president William McKinley signed the Newsland Resolution The Newsland Resolution made Hawaii a territory of the United States This ended any legal or military chance of restoring the Queen and the Hawaiian Kingdom

Dole served as governor of Hawaii from 1900 until 1903 when he accepted a position as United States District Court judge He remained a judge until 1915 

Ancient Egypt or the Egyptian Empire was a society that began about 3500 BC and lasted until 20 BC when it was invaded by the Roman Empire 

It grew along the River Nile and was at its most powerful in the second millennium BC At one time it went all the way from the Nile delta to Nubia a kingdom which today is mostly in the Sudan

For most of its history Egypt was prosperous since the water from the Nile made sure that the Egyptians would have good crops 

The Egyptians created a way of writing using hieroglyphs built huge temples and tombs trading with other areas and had a powerful army Their religion had many gods and its priests were a powerful and wealthy group Their rulers called Pharaohs were thought to be close to the gods

Archaeologists or people who dig in the earth to find ancient objects have found that people have lived along the Nile for a very long time The fertile flood plains of the Nile allowed people to begin farming By the 10th millennium BC the people in Egypt had begun growing cereal grains like wheat and barley and because they were farming they stayed in one place because they were settled society became more complex and involved This was an important step in the history of human civilization

This period in Egyptian history is called predynastic as it happened before the large kingdoms were formed By about 5500 BC small tribes living in the Nile valley had developed into a series of cultures Each had begun farming both crops and animals They had their own types of pottery and personal items such as combs bracelets and beads In upper Egypt the north part of the country the Badari was one of the biggest groups It was known for its high quality pottery stone tools and its use of copper They were followed by the Amratian and Gerzian cultures They had improved tools and other new ideas In Gerzian times the people were making contact with Palestine and the Byblos coast

The different periods are of ancient Egyptian history are

The Intermediate periods included times when the traditional system broke down the country was split or invaded by foreign rulers Egypts culture and climate was relatively stable compared to other parts of the Middle East Nevertheless they had some periods when their government was challenged and sometimes overthrown

Ancient Egypt was split up into many different districts called sepats The first divisions were created during the Predynastic Period but then they were small city states that ruled themselves When the first pharaoh came to power the sepats remained and were much like the counties in todays England They stayed basically the same for a long time there were 42 of them and each was ruled by a governor called a nomarch This person was put in power by the pharaoh

Ancient Egypt had a lot of different taxes but there was no real money so people paid each other with goods or work The person who watched the tax collection was called the scribe and every tax collector in Egypt had to tell him every day how many taxes they had collected Each person paid different taxes based on the work that they did craftsmen paid in goods hunters and fishermen paid with food and every single household in the country had to pay a labour tax every year by helping with work for the country like mining or for canals A lot of rich Egyptians paid poorer people to do this for them

The language can be divided into six time periods

Egypt had writing called hieroglyphics which is one of the two oldest written languages Hieroglyphic writing dates to c 3200 BC and is composed of some 500 symbols A hieroglyph can represent a word a sound or a silent determinative The same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts Hieroglyphs were for public purposes used on stone monuments and in tombs It was art and often it was political propaganda 

Hieroglyphs like Japanese or Chinese characters started out as ideographic characters or writing made of pictures This ancient writing has no vowels all sounds in the writing are consonants Of course they used vowels when they spoke we have to work out what they were

The script used by priests for everyday writing on papyrus wood or cloth In day to day writing scribes used a cursive form of writing called hieratic which was quicker and easier While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction hieratic was always written from right to left usually in horizontal rows

The script used by ordinary people A new form of writing Demotic became the main writing style and it is this form of writing along with formal hieroglyphs that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone

The Coptic script is a modified Greek alphabet The Coptic language is the last stage of the Egyptian language

Religion was very important to Ancient Egyptians To Egyptians all African animals were holy and were worshipped Because of this Egyptians domesticated or made pets of animals very early and took very good care of them The centre of any Egyptian town was the temple and this building was used for everything from the town hall to a university in addition to its religious services 

Because they were so religious Egyptians created a lot of art of their gods This art shows all different kinds of divine or holy creatures including the pharaoh who was thought to be a god 

The afterlife was also very important to Egyptians and they are known for mummifying their dead These mummies are important to scientists today because they tell them about how the Egyptians lived

The rich fertile soil came from annual inundations of the Nile River The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural technological and artistic pursuits In ancient Egypt taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned

Farming in Egypt was dependent on the cycle of the Nile River The Egyptians recognized three seasons Akhet Peret and Shemu The flooding season lasted from June to September depositing on the rivers banks a layer of mineral rich silt ideal for growing crops After the floodwaters had receded the growing season lasted from October to February Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields which were irrigated with ditches and canals Egypt received little rainfall so farmers relied on the Nile to water their cropsp514 From March to May farmers used sickles to harvest their crops which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain Winnowing removed the chaff from the grain and the grain was then ground into flour brewed to make beer or stored for later usep506

Flax plants were grown for the fibers of their stems These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread which was used to weave sheets of linen and to make clothing Papyrus growing on the banks of the Nile River was used to make paper Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots close to habitations and on higher ground and had to be watered by hand Vegetables included leeks garlic melons squashes pulses lettuce and other crops in addition to grapes that were made into winep577 630

The Egyptians believed that a balanced relationship between people and animals was an essential element of the cosmic order thus humans animals and plants were believed to be members of a single wholep117 Cattle were the most important livestock livestock were taxed the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple which owned them In addition to cattle the ancient Egyptians kept sheep goats and pigs Poultry such as ducks geese and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms where they were force fed with dough to fatten themp381 The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom and they provided both honey and waxp409

The ancient Egyptians used donkeys and oxen as beasts of burden They plowed the fields and trampled seed into the soil The slaughter of a fattened ox was part of an offering ritualp381 Horses were introduced by the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period and the camel although known from the New Kingdom was not used as a beast of burden until the Late Period There is also evidence to suggest that elephants were briefly used in the Late Period but largely abandoned due to lack of grazing land Dogs cats and monkeys were common family pets while more exotic pets imported from the heart of Africa such as lions were reserved for royalty Herodotus observed that the Egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses During the Predynastic and Late periods the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular such as the cat goddess Bastet and the ibis god Thoth and these animals were bred in large numbers on farms for the purpose of ritual sacrificep229

Ancient Egyptians had some advanced medical knowledge for their time They performed surgery set broken bones and even knew about medicines Some medicines the Ancient Egyptians used are honey and breast milk or gazelles milk Not only did they have medicinal values they also are believed to have been used to ward off evil spirits and demons The easiest way to see how good they were at medicine is to look at the medical papyri which have survived to the present day The Edwin Smith papyrus is the worlds oldest surviving surgical document from about 1600 BC The text describes anatomy and the examination diagnosis treatment and prognosis of 48 types of medical problems in detail

Engineering was a very specialised art in Egypt Engineers were able to survey or find the area between two points make very complicated structures called pyramids that were nearly perfect geometrically create cement and make large irrigation networks There is even the belief that Ancient Egyptians created a kind of battery

Science was also very important Some believe that the beginning of the modern scientific method was in Egypt Mathematics were also in use in Egypt and the golden ratio was even used in the construction of the Pyramids

Another famous ability of the Egyptians was glassmaking Archaeologists have found many pieces of beads jars figures and ornaments in tombs across the nation In 2005 there was even the discovery of an ancient glassmaking factory

Alexander the Great was an Ancient Greek king of the kingdom of Macedon He was born in the city of Pella and his father was the king Philip II He was taught most of his skills in Athens during his childhood He was taught by a great teacher and world famous philosopher named Aristotle and through his teachings he became the worlds first great military commander At the age of 20 he became the king of Macedonia after his father had been assassinated by a former bodyguard He wanted to rule a large empire called Persia He is often listed as one of the greatest military commanders in history along with Hannibal Barca Ashoka the Great Julius Caesar Genghis Khan Subutai Napoleon I of France and others However his men soon grew tired of traveling so far and threatened to revolt Around India he finally agreed to turn back By the time of his death he had conquered most of the Middle Eastern world known to Europeans which included ancient Persia Egypt and Asia Minor 

He died in Babylon in 323 BC of an unknown cause Nobody knows the cause of Alexanders death Some people have said his death was caused by poison in wine murder or a fever after a battle 

Brisbane is the capital of Queensland in the northeast of Australia 

The Brisbane River flows through the city 

1730000 people live there and there is both a Catholic and a Protestant Bishop 

Brisbane was founded in 1824 and was meant at first for prisoners who were embarked to Australia The name comes from a Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane 

The Hawaiian language is the language of native Hawaiians Aloha and Mahalo are probably its most recognized words worldwide though the word lanai has been absorbed into English Taboo is Tahitian from the same Proto Polynesian root from which the Hawaiian language grew 

Other Pacific islands whose languages come from this same root form what is called the Polynesian Triangle and include the Marquesas Raratonga Samoa some islands of what is now Fiji and New Zealand

Substantial linguistic drift has occurred among them over the last two thousand years or so Nonetheless native speakers of all these languages can still make themselves understood to one another

The language has only 12 letters 13 if you count the okina which is legitimate it drifted from some K sounds in the early Polynesian tongue into a glottal stop like the break in the middle of the word Oh oh These days the okina is written as a backward apostrophe

The Niihau dialect still uses some T S Rs and hints of B sounds but this is not common among other modern speakers

Every Hawaiian syllable ends with a vowel There are some who suppose that this trait is what lends the language its Musicality Some claim that final vowels helped the speakers memorize chanted traditional stories and genealogies Most linguists however would reject this interpretation and note that this property of Hawaiian is a result of internal phonological processes

There are two forms of each of the five vowels regular and extended The meanings of words spelled the same but with or without the appropriate kahakos or okinas can be very different sometimes creating embarrassment

One might think that learning the language would be relatively easy but that only applies to na keiki who have never learned the 26 letters that English speakers use There is a childrens rhyme that goes on for a couple minutes that consists of nothing but both versions of the letters a i and the okina It talks of him eating his fish 

When the missionaries first created a written form of Hawaiian Language they did not write the kahakos or okinas leaving it to the context to make the meanings evident 

Since the intent was to translate the Bible natives forgave some of the confusions created but nonetheless latched onto the way that unintended double entendres could appear in written form as a source of humor When later Hawaiian language newspapers appeared Native speaking writers and editors took care to avoid these

Skinheads named after their short haircuts are members of a subculture that originated in Britain in late 1960s where they were closely tied to the Rude Boys and the Mods They shave their heads because originally most of them were workers in factories and they had to be bald so their hair could not get caught in the machines 

Traditional skinheads identify with the original skinhead movement in music style andor working class pride Skinheads listen to ska rocksteady reggae Oi and punk music

People who are not part of the group often see Skinheads as being politically close to the Neo Nazi movement Often Skinheads are seen as part of that movement This is wrong given that there are many young people in the movement who have no political views at all Many Skinheads are also not violent unless they are provoked

Anime is Japanese for Animation or cartoons In some places the term anime refers to Japanese Animation or Animation similar in style to Japanese Animation But in Japan anime means all animation in general This article is about Japanese animation

Some anime is drawn by hand but anime can also be made with computers There are many types of anime you can find anime about sports magic or romance These are just some examples Anime is shown on television on DVD and VHS and is used in computer and video games Also some anime cartoons are just movies but they have cartoon characters and animation instead of real people and places Anime is often based on Japanese comics that are called manga and graphic novels Sometimes live action movies and television series are based on an anime 

The history of anime begins around 1900 when Japanese filmmakers tried ways of animation that came from France Germany United States and Russia

The filmmakers in Japan did not have a lot of money to make their movies and not a lot of places where they could film their movies The people that the filmmakers could use as actors in their movies was also a problem for making Japanese movies Japanese people look different from people in other places in the world and it was hard for filmmakers to make a movie about places other than Japan with Japanese actors Movie makers liked animation because then they could have animator draw other places and people that could not be filmed in a normal movie and the animators could be very creative with the cartoons they made

During the 1970s more and more people started to like manga At the same time manga were used as the starting point to make anime with the same characters and stories Animators would take the drawings done by a manga artist and the stories the manga artist wrote and turn them into the stories and characters of a similar anime At that time Osamu Tezuka became very popular Now he is called a legend and the god of manga Tezuka and other pioneers of anime made a lot of types of stories and styles that are common to anime today The giant robot genre began with manga and anime from Tezukas ideas Robot anime like Gundam and Macross became classics in the 1980s Today the robot genre is still very popular in Japan and worldwide In the 1980s anime became very popular in Japan and saw an increase in production There are a lot of different kinds of anime that many different kinds of people like besides Mecha and there are types of anime based on the age of the people who might like it or the subject of the anime

Very popular stories in anime and manga are often translated into other languages and the words used in the anime or manga will be put into another language where they mean the same thing That way people who live outside of Japan and who do not understand Japanese can also understand the stories If a manga or anime is not translated by a company in another country sometimes people in that country will translate the story to share with other people for free before a company translates it for the general public This is good because it allows more people to watch animes but some companies think it is stealing

In the late 1980s lots of people in countries other than Japan started to like anime too In the United States giant robot anime became popular In Europe anime for children became popular Today many different kinds of anime are popular all around the world Anime helped spread in popularity thanks to the internet

OpenBSD is a secure free computer operating system It can run on many types of computers including Intel PCs and Apple Computers PowerPCs

Like the other open source BSDs and unlike with most Linux operating systems the whole operating system is developed by the same group of people with OpenBSD Programmes from other sources are available separately

OpenBSD is often the first to add new security tools to make it harder to break developers have also carefully read through the programming code to check for mistakes more than once The project is led by Theo de Raadt from Calgary Alberta Canada and is released under conditions which put few rerestrictions on people that use the source code the BSD licence

OpenBSD releases new versions every six months each version is supported for one year after release OpenBSD 44 was released November 1 2008

OpenBSDs first mascot was a BSD daemon with a halo it was replaced with Puffy a pufferfish on June 15th 2000 with the release of OpenBSD 27

The operating systems developers add in many new technologies to make the system more secure technologies like WX Stack Protection malloc reconfigurations and ssh to replace telnet and rlogin

Because it is so secure OpenBSD is often used as a firewall and for other security related jobs It is also usable for on a desktop computer it can act and look like one of several other operating systems like Mac OS X Microsoft Windows and others

A civil war is a war that takes place between different groups in one country While civil wars can take place for lots of reasons there are two reasons that are very common

The first is because the different groups disagree about who should be in charge or how the country should be run If two political parties disagree about the result of an election this might lead to a war if the two sides cannot or would not come to an agreement

The second is because one group of people does not want to be part of the country anymore This is known as a war of secession Lots of people living in a certain area might decide that they want to break away and make their own country Very few national leaders would be happy to give up land that is part of that country and a war could result

Sometimes the people who want to break away do not necessarily want to form a whole new country but they might want more control over their affairs This happens sometimes when different ethnic groups belong to the same nation

Civil wars are often just as destructive and damaging as normal wars between two different countries Often they can linger on for a very long time This is because civil wars tend to become complicated very quickly A civil war might start between two sides but groups might break up and the new different sides could start fighting each other Groups of people who were not involved at the beginning can easily be sucked in as they start getting weapons to defend themselves against both sides Civil wars with many different sides all fighting each other have occurred

Nations that have had a civil war include

Nations that are currently having civil wars include

A crocodile is a large reptile that lives in water They are considered to be living fossils The name Crocodile can also sometimes be used for any member of the order Crocodilia 

The crocodile can snap its jaw shut very fast and has much power closing its jaw but crocodiles have very little strength opening their jaws and any regular man can most likely hold it shut with their bare hands

Crocodiles range in size from African Dwarf crocodiles that measure rarely over 5 feet to saltwater crocodiles which can approach 23 feet

Crocodiles live in rivers lakes and dams in parts of America Asia Africa and Australia Some of the crocodiles from Australia live in salt water These saltwater crocodiles are normally bigger than the ones that live in fresh water While crocodiles spend most of their time in water they can come out and move around on the land Crocodiles cannot breathe underwater they breathe air just like people They can hold their breath for a long time underwater

Their colours range from brown to grey and have different patterns covering them they have many shapesthey differ in colors they have sharp claws and also sharp teeth

The difference between an alligator and a crocodile is that one can not see the fourth tooth in the lower jaw of an alligator when the alligators mouth is closed One can see the fourth tooth in the lower jaw of a crocodile when its mouth is closed Sometimes it is said that alligators have as wide a snout as crocodiles have a narrow snout but there are also some crocodiles with wide snouts

Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was a Russian composer who lived in the Romantic period He is the most popular of all Russian composers He wrote melodies which were exciting and dramatic and full of emotions He learned a lot from studying the music of Western Europe but his music also sounds very Russian His compositions include 11 operas 3 ballets orchestral music chamber music and over 100 songs His ballets have some of the best known tunes in all classical music

Tchaikovskys father was a Ukrainian whose job was a mining engineer His mothers grandfather was a Frenchman who had moved to Russia She was a nervous woman and Tchaikovsky may have got his nervous character from her Tchaikovsky was only five when he started taking piano lessons He was soon better than his teacher The family had an orchestrion which played some tunes from classical music by Mozart Bellini Donizetti and Rossini 

In 1848 the family moved to St Petersburg Tchaikovsky was unhappy and unsettled as he was often separated from his family who moved several times In 1854 his mother died He tried to comfort himself by playing music He spent nine years at the School of Jurisprudence When he left school he had to get a job For four years he worked as a clerk in the Ministry of Justice Then the composer and pianist Anton Rubinstein helped him to become a music student at the newly opened conservatory in St Petersburg He learned to play the flute and the organ as well as the piano and learning all about composition  In 1866 he moved to Moscow where Nikolai Rubinstein the brother of Anton encouraged him to write music with a Russian character He worked very hard and was often exhausted but he managed to finish his First Symphony which was performed in 1868 

Tchaikovsky met some famous musicians including the French composer Berlioz who was visiting Moscow He also became friendly with the Russian composer Mily Balakirev who was very helpful and persuaded him to rewrite one of his works several times until it was very good The result was a piece for orchestra called Romeo and Juliet which soon became internationally known Balakirev had four friends who were composers This circle of friends is often called The Five or The Mighty Handful They were interested in using Russian folktunes in their music Tchaikovsky was never a member of the group although he liked their ideas Tchaikovsky was different to them he had learned music at the Conservatoire where he had studied Western music The harmonies that he used in his works were often not suitable for Russian folktunes He wrote many songs which are romantic in character One of them None but the lonely heart is especially well known in English

By now Tchaikovsky was writing works which were to make him very famous He wrote two more symphonies and his First Piano Concerto one of the most popular of all piano concertos was given its first performance in Boston He was also writing operas and chamber music

In 1875 Tchaikovsky began making a long tour of Europe He liked Bizets opera Carmen but Wagners operas from the Ring cycle bored him In 1877 he finished Swan Lake the first of his three ballets The audience did not like it at first because the dancers were not very good

In the summer of 1877 Tchaikovsky decided to marry His wife was called Antonina Milyukova The marriage was a disaster  A few weeks after the marriage he ran away and never lived with her again

Another woman was to become important in his life but in a very different way It was to be a very unusual relationship Her name was Nadezhda von Meck She was the wife of a rich man She loved Tchaikovskys music and promised him that she would pay him a lot of money every month so long as he promised her that he would never try to meet her Tchaikovsky no longer needed to work He was able to give up his teaching job at the Conservatory For several years he spent the winters in Europe and the summers in Russia Nadezhda and Tchaikovsky wrote long letters to one another often quite passionate and dreamythey talked about love life and how they wanted it to change but they never saw one another He had plenty of time to write music he wrote several operas including Eugene Onegin and his Fourth and Fifth Symphonies the Violin Concerto the Serenade for Strings Capriccio Italienne and the 1812 Overture Tchaikovsky loved Nadezhda very much but never actually told her his true feelings

By 1885 Tchaikovsky had got tired of travelling around He rented a country house in Klin just outside Moscow He lived a regular life reading walking in the forest composing during the day and playing music with his friends in the evenings He started to have more confidence as a conductor and toured Europe twice conducting in Leipzig Berlin Prague Hamburg Paris and London In 1889 he finished his second ballet The Sleeping Beauty and the next year while staying in Florence he wrote his famous opera The Queen of Spades based on a story by Pushkin Later that year Nadezhda von Meck wrote to him that she had lost nearly all her money and could not continue to support him

In the spring of 1891 he was invited to conduct in New York where the Carnegie Hall was being opened He also conducted concerts in Baltimore and Philadelphia When he returned to Russia he wrote his last ballet The Nutcracker and his Sixth Symphony known as the Pathtique which was dedicated to his nephew with whom he was passionately in love This work is often considered his best It was performed in St Petersburg on 16 October 1893 Five days later he suddenly became ill A lot of people in the city had a terrible illness called cholera The germs of this illness can be spread through water Tchaikovsky died four days later Many people think that he committed suicide by deliberately drinking contaminated water He may have wanted to commit suicide in order to avoid a scandal because he was having a relationship with a nephew of an important aristocratic man Exactly what happened will always be a mystery

The sea level is the average height of the ocean The word average must be used because the height of the sea changes with the tides

The height of mountains countries and so on is almost always given as above sea level

Global warming means that the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are melting and the oceans are expanding Sea level rises could easily top a metre by 2100 Low lying areas such as Bangladesh Florida and the Netherlands face massive flooding

The group was first of all made up of Penny Rimbaud and Steve Ignorant Later they were joined by other people who also lived together in their shared house called Dial House

Crass did their first concert at a squatted festival in Huntley Street North London Soon after they played at the famous punk club The Roxy in Londons Covent Garden area However the group were made to come off of the stage because they were very drunk They also did early concerts with punk band the UK Subs but not many people went to watch these concerts

After this members of Crass decided to be more serious about what they were doing They decided to wear black clothes all of the time whether or not they were on stage This was so that no member of the band would be seen as the group leader They also made a banner that they hung up behind them when they were playing live This had a logo on it that was made up of symbols like the Christian cross the swastika and the British flag as well as a snake with two heads that is eating itself The meaning of this logo was the idea that power will destroy itself

Crass released their first record in 1978 It was called The Feeding of the 5000 It was meant to have 18 songs on it but one song was banned by the people who worked at the factory where the records were made This was because they thought it was blasphemous This song was called Asylum The band instead released the record with a 2 minute gap where that song had been which they called The Sound of Free Speech After this they set up their own record label called Crass Records This was so that they could control what was on their own records in the future They re recorded and released the song that had been banned as a single They also re released the first LP with the banned song put back on it

The second LP released by Crass was the double album Stations of the Crass It was released in 1979 One side of this LP was a recording of a live concert that the band played at the Pied Bull pub in Islington London on August 7 1979

Their next LP was released in 1981 It was called Penis Envy The band had deliberately changed their sound for this record The lyrics and the record cover artwork had a strong feminist message Steve Ignorant did not appear upon it Instead only the women members of the band Eve Libertine and Joy DeVivre sung the songs 

The Crass Records label also released many other records by other musicians and bands These included Flux Of Pink Indians Conflict Poison Girls Zounds Honey Bane Rudimentary Peni and others

Black Flag was an American punk rock band They formed in California in 1977 and broke up in 1986 There were many different members in the band but the leader was Greg Ginn Ginn was the guitarist and wrote many of the songs

Black Flag was one of the groups that created the hardcore punk style They toured the United States and Canada to play many live shows They influenced many other musicians and fans to make their own hardcore bands 

After breaking up the lead singer Henry Rollins formed a new band by himself Rollins Band and guitarist Greg Ginn worked on a separate career in the early 90s

The Crazy Frog is a 3D animated creature featured on music albums

Before becoming a ringtone to download onto mobile phones The Crazy Frog started as a TruboForce 3D animated creature It was called The Annoying Thing in 2003 by its creator Erik Wernquist of Sweden With big eyes and a bigger mouth the high resolution anthropomorphic thing is dappled grey blue and nude save for a helmet goggles and biker vest All original videos and images also show small male humanoid genital in a relaxed state that move realistically Some sources pixel out or remove the genitals

Members of Bass Bumpers had a dance remix of Harold Faltermeyers Axel F the Beverly Hills Cop theme adding Daniel Maldemahls impression of a moped engine and a Max Headroom Whats going on In the music video for that remix the Thing says featured bites from Daniels bit and zooms around on a mimed bike to escape a robot minion on a hover bike 

The internet and media dubbed it both a Frog and crazy Erik went along with it

First it was simply a vocal imitation of a two stroke internal combustion engine Daniel Malmedahl of Sweden created a recording of his imitation in 1997 that eventually spread through peer to peer file sharing on the Internet

The company that sells Crazy Frog ringtones has made 14 million from it

The Universal Serial Bus is technology that allows a person to connect an electronic device to a computer It is a high speed serial bus 

It is most used on Personal computers USB is also used on other devices such as the PlayStation 2 PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 USB connects different devices using a standard interface

The standard was made to improve plug and play devices This means that a device can simply be plugged into a free socket The computer will then recognise it The computer sometimes installs special software so that the device can directly be used When it is no longer needed it is disconnected again This technology is called hot swapping meaning it can be plugged and unplugged while the power is on The computer does not need to be restarted to use a USB device

USB can also provide a small amount of power to the attached device through the USB chord Devices that only need a little power can get it from the bus and do not need a separate electric power plug That allows gadgets like USB battery chargers lights and fans

Most people use USB for computer mice keyboards scanners printers digital cameras and USB flash drives There are over one billion USB devices around the world

The first version of the Universal Serial Bus was created in 1995 This new technology became an instant success Since the introduction of USB people that make electronic devices thought about how it could be used in the future Today USB connects a computer or other devices like laptops and MP3 players to peripheral devices

The bus was introduced by seven companies which represent the leaders in the industry of information technology Compaq IBM Intel Microsoft NEC Northern Telecom and Digital Equipment Corporation

Several years earlier adopters and developers of USB held a meeting called Plugfest at a special hotel in California to test their devices They selected a hotel that included two rooms one for sleeping and the other one for testing The meeting lasted three days During the meeting the representatives of about 50 companies connected their USB devices to one general host system

The logo of the USB device also has its own history The USB logo was in development for several months 

Currently there are three different USB standards that are used USB 10 USB 11 and USB 20 USB 10 is now rarely used

USB offers three different transfer speeds 15 MBit per second 12 MBit per second and 480 MBitsecond Hi speed is only available in USB 20 Please note that these speeds are raw data speeds The actual data rate is usually lower

In order to use the hi speed transfer rate the USB controller and the connected device both need to support it USB is backwards compatible This means that a USB 20 device can be used with a USB 11 controller but only at the speed the USB 11 controller supports

Almost all computers sold today have USB ports and most of them support USB 20 The number of ports they have is usually limited though Between two and six ports are common USB allows connecting USB hubs to add more USB ports

The hubs themselves are also USB 11 or USB 20 compliant On an USB 20 controller standards can be mixed Devices connected to a USB 11 hub will only go as fast as USB 11 rates

USB was designed to be easy to use When the connectors were designed lessons learned from other connection techologies were also applied to USB connectors

A USB system has an asymmetric design It is made of a host several downstream USB ports and multiple peripheral devices connected in a star topology Additional USB hubs may be included in the tiers allowing branching into a tree structure with up to five tier levels

A USB host can have multiple host controllers Each host controller provides one or more USB ports Up to 127 devices including the hub devices may be connected to a single host controller

USB devices are linked in series through hubs There is always one hub known as the root hub The root hub is built into to the host controller There are special hubs called sharing hubs These allow multiple computers to access the same peripheral devices They work by switching the access between PCs either manually or automatically They are popular in small office environments In network terms they converge rather than diverge branches

A physical USB device can have several logical sub devices that are referred to as device functions A single device may provide several functions for example a webcam with a built in microphone

USB device communication is based on pipes Pipes are connections from the host controller to a logical entity on the device named an endpoint The term endpoint is occasionally used to incorrectly refer to the pipe A USB device can have up to 32 active pipes 16 into the host controller and 16 out of the controller

Each endpoint can transfer data in one direction only either into or out of the device so each pipe is uni directional Endpoints are grouped into interfaces and each interface is associated with a single device function An exception to this is endpoint zero which is used for device configuration and which is not associated with any interface

When a USB device is first connected to a USB host the USB device enumeration process is started The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device The speed of the USB device is determined during the reset signaling After reset the USB devices information is read by the host then the device is assigned a unique 7 bit address If the device is supported by the host the device drivers needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the device is set to a configured state If the USB host is restarted the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices

The host controller polls the bus for traffic usually in a round robin fashion so no USB device can transfer any data on the bus without an explicit request from the host controller

The computer hardware that contains the host controller and the root hub has an interface for the programmer It is called Host Controller Device and is defined by the hardware implementer

For USB 10 and 11 there were two different HCD implementations Open Host Controller Interface and Universal Host Controller Interface OHCI was developed by Compaq Microsoft and National Semiconductor UHCI by Intel

VIA Technologies licensed the UHCI standard from Intel all other chipset implementers use OHCI UHCI relies more on software This means UHCI is slightly more processor intensive than OHCI but easier and cheaper to make Because there were two different implementations operating system vendors and hardware vendors needed to develop and test on both of them This increased cost

The USB specification does not specify any HCD interfaces and is not concerned with them In other words USB defines the format of data transfer through the port but not the system by which the USB hardware communicates with the computer it sits in

During the design phase of USB 20 the USB IF insisted that there was only one implementation The USB 20 HCD implementation is called the Enhanced Host Controller Interface Only EHCI can support hi speed transfers Most of PCI based EHCI controllers have other HCD implementations called companion host controller to support Full Speed and may be used for any device that claims to be a member of a certain class An operating system is supposed to implement all device classes so it can provide generic drivers for any USB device Device classes are decided upon by the Device Working Group of the USB Implementers Forum

Device classes include

Punk rock is a music genre related to rock music It is often described as harder louder and cruder than other rock music Many punk rock songs have lyrics which tell angry stories or which use rude or controversial words

Punk rock is a style of music Many musicians and punk rock music listeners want to protest or rebel against the norms or rules of society Punks say that people should Do It Yourself which means that people should try to accomplish their goals using the materials in their own communities Many punk bands make their own music recordings and distribute them without using a major record company

Many punks have strong political beliefs Punk rock musicians are often mad at the government the police and laws Many punk rock songs protest injustice lies and unfairness in countries Almost all punks are leftists who believe that a country should share the products and food that it produces with all the people in the country Some punks are vegetarian or vegans because they believe that animals should not be killed for food Some punks are anarchists Very few punks are conservative libertarian or Republican

Many punk musicians put colored hair dye in their hair or put gel to make it stand up They wear distinctive clothes as a form of protest or rebellion against the norms and rules of society

Punk rock developed in New York City in the mid 1970s Bands like The Ramones Television The Heartbreakers Blondie and Patti Smith played loud angry songs Many bands played at a club called CBGBs The music soon spread to Australia and Britain were bands started playing punk rock in 1976 1977 British bands like Buzzcocks The Clash The Damned Generation X The Jam and Sex Pistols played punk rock music that was inspired by the music being played in New York as well as by garage rock pub rock and other protopunk music

These early punks rejected the excesses of mainstream 1970s rock They created fast hard edged music with short songs stripped down instrumentation and often political anti establishment lyrics They often did controversial things such as saying bad words in public Many newspapers wrote articles about the bad behavior of punk rock musicians

In the 1980s a new type of punk rock called hardcore punk or hardcore developed Punk rock music began being mixed with Heavy Metal rock music Many hardcore bands began playing in the United States

In the 1990s punk rock began being mixed with pop music to create a new lighter style of music called pop punk Pop punk bands include Green Day and Good Charlotte Some pop punk bands mixed punk rock with ska music

Pop punk was still popular in the 2000s Some people who like the 1970s style punk rock criticize pop punk because pop punk is commercialized

Some people say that punk rock is dead But that is not true because the spirit lives on and many punk rockers are around today

The Mayflower was a ship It is most famous on its maiden voyage when pilgrims and other settlers travelled on it to the Plymouth colony in Massachusetts The Mayflower set sail from England in July of 1620 but had to turn around twice because Speedwell the ship it was traveling with was leaking It left on September 6 of the same year leaving the Speedwell behind The ship carried 102 men women and children who lived in the dark damp cold cargo decks below the crews quarters Many of them died on the voyage

After over two months at sea the English colonists arrived at Cape Cod on November 11 1620 A few weeks later they sailed up the coast to Plymouth and started to build their town where a group of Wampanoag people had lived before They lived on the ship for a few more months rowing to shore to build houses in the day and returning to the ship at night Many people began to get very sick from the cold and the wet About half the people on the Mayflower died that first winter from common illnesses such as colds coughs and fevers In March of 1621 there were enough houses for everyone to live on land The Mayflower set sail back to England on April 5 1621 

In 1623 a year after Christopher Joness death the Mayflower was probably dismantled for firewood in England

Uniforms are special clothes to show that a group of people belong together The group of people will all be dressed in the same way

People may wear uniforms for several reasons The uniform will help the people to feel a team spirit so that they work well together They may also help members of the public to know who they are eg in a department store a customer can tell who is a member of staff or in the street people will recognize a police officer Uniforms may also be worn because they are practical eg it might keep them safe when operating machinery or keep them clean when doing their work

In the army soldiers wear uniform They also wear extra things such as badges on their uniform which show how important they are

Nurses in hospitals wear uniform Sometimes servants wear uniform when working for their employers Important domestic workers may wear special smart uniforms called livery eg porters at luxury hotels

In some countries such as India Japan China Korea Australia and United Kingdom many school children wear uniform The uniform would be a set of clothes with the school crest or symbol It helps them to feel proud of their school and children from rich families and poor families all look the same In Britain for example most young children wear school uniform In state schools the children may wear polo necked T shirts with a school logo Other schools especially private schools may have a formal uniform or they may be free to choose their own clothes so long as they are the school colour

The Battle of Trafalgar was a sea battle fought on 21 October 1805 between the navies of France and Spain on one side and Great Britain on the other The battle took place near Cape Trafalgar which is in southwest Spain The battle ended with a clear victory for the British forces This allowed Britain to become the worlds largest sea power for 100 years The Battle of Trafalgar was the most important sea battle of the 19th century

France and Britain had been at war for some time France had built the strongest army in Europe and controlled much of the land Because it was an island Britain had built a strong navy and had used this to try to prevent French ships from leaving their ports Because the French leader Napoleon Bonaparte wanted to invade Britain he knew that he would have to sink the British navy first otherwise it would be able to prevent his army from landing

The British knew that France might try to attack them and had placed ships outside the important French ports like Toulon The admiral in charge of the British fleet was Lord Horatio Nelson He had become famous in Britain for his victories over the French such as at the Battle of the Nile in 1798

But the French navy managed to avoid Nelsons fleet and leave Toulon during a storm and met up with a group of Spanish ships Spain at the time was an ally of France This small fleet first sailed to the West Indies then returned across the Atlantic Ocean to the Spanish port of Cadiz They wanted to join up with more French ships to make a stronger fleet The British had chased them both ways across the ocean

The French then learned that some British ships had been seen in Gibraltar and thought this meant that the British fleet was not as strong as it had been before So they decided that this was the best time to leave Cadiz

The next day the 33 ships of the French and Spanish fleet were met by the 27 ships of the British Nelson had put his ships into two lines Before the battle started he sent a message which was to become famous England expects that every man will do his duty

The two British lines sailed through the French and Spanish line splitting it and was able to cause great damage to its ships

However Admiral Nelson on board his ship HMS Victory was hit by a musket bullet fired by a sniper from the French ship Redoutable The bullet entered via his shoulder went into his lung and lodged in his spine He was taken below the deck and died later shortly before 430pm as the battle died down The French and Spanish had lost 22 ships the British lost none 

Because France was unable to invade Britain British soldiers were able to fight on the European continent together with the armies of other countries against the armies of Napoleon In the end Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo With control of the seas Britain was able to build up a large empire during the years that followed and its navy was the worlds largest for over a hundred years

Nelsons body was brought back to Great Britain and he was given a heros funeral In 1843 the famous Trafalgar Square and Nelsons Column were built in London to honour him

Derek and the Dominos an American blues rock band The bands members were Eric Clapton Carl Radle Bobby Whitlock Jim Gordon and Duane Allman They made the album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs Layla one of the greatest love songs with the well known guitar riff came from that same album The band broke up after one album

Carl Dean Radle was an American musician best known for being the bassist in Derek and the Dominos Radle worked with many well known artists and worked on many gold and platinum singles and albums Radle is thought by many to have been the best bass guitar sideman in the music business 

In May 30 1980 Radle died at age 37 of problems from a kidney infection caused by his alcoholism and drug addiction

Radle took clarinet and piano lessons when he was young While at Edison High School in Tulsa Radle fell in love with rock and roll By the time he graduated in 1960 Radle had a bought an old guitar and taught himself how to play As he became more skilled he began playing in Tulsa clubs in the area with friends and musicians David Gates Leon Russell JJ Cale Jim Markham Tommy Crook Jim Karstein Chuck Blackwell Larry Bell and many others This group would be considered the starters of what a style of music known as The Tulsa Sound After graduating high school they began to go to California to try to get into the music business

Leon Russell was one of the first to go to California and his homestubio on Skyhill Drive in Hollywood became a place for young Tulsa musicians and different friends to stay They mostly played as back up musicians in clubs with soon to be well known singers like Bobby Rydell fronting the act Radle during this time recorded with pop duo Skip Flip with Radle they released the single Tossin and Turnin Everytime I Have to Cry

After finding it very hard to make a living in the music world Radle came back to Tulsa in 1964 and joined the Air National Guard Radle was stationed in Texas for about a year and was released from the Air National Guard in 1965 After that he came back to Tulsa again once he returned Russell called Radle from California offering a job as the new bass guitarist for Gary Lewis the Playboys

Radle gave the music business another chance and moved back to California Radle recorded and toured with Gary Lewis the Playboys for about a year During that time he was on television shows such as The Ed Sullivan Show Shindig Hullabaloo and The Tonight Show Other Tulsan musicians Jimmy Karstein and Tommy Crook also were members of this group During this time they had many top ten sings like Everybody Loves a Clown and Count Me In Radle worked on fourteen of Gary Lewiss albums This trip ended in January of 1967 when Gary Lewis was broken wikt linkconscriptiondrafted into military service and the band ended

Radle stayed in California doing studio work and pick up gigs including working behind Dobie Gray in clubs He recorded some with John Lee Hooker Radle was on two albums in 1968 with The Colours The Colours and Atmosphere which also had Tulsan musician Chuck Blackwell In 1969 Leon Russell introduced Radle to Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett to help form the group Delaney Bonnie and Friends This group included Leon Russell Rita Collidge and Dave Mason On tour the group was the opening act for Blind Faith a supergroup which Eric Clapton was apart of Once Blind Faith broke up Eric Clapton joined Delaney Bonnie and Friends for a tour and an album Radle worked on writing and arranging two of the groups hit songs Get Ourselves Together and Never Ending Song of Love

Delaney Bonnie and Friends split up after about a year and in early 1970 some of the former members including Radle joined Leon Russell who formed the Joe Cocker Mad Dogs and Englishmen ensemble The group had more than two dozen artists and performers The tour went through forty six cities in fifty six days This tour was one of the biggest in rock history A major movie and a gold selling album came from this same tour

During that tour Bobby Whitlock became friends with Eric Clapton who wanted to put together a group to tour and promote his first solo album This group would turn into Derek and the Dominos Whitlock called in Radle and Los Angeles drummer Jim Gordon to join the group They took time in May and July of 1970 to work with George Harrison on his album All Things Must Pass which had the hit singles My Sweet Lord and What is Life During a break in June Clapton Gordon Whitlock and Radle began serious work and completed their first single as Derek and the Dominos Tell the Truth with Roll it Over on the B side After the George Harrison sessions finished in late summer of 1970 the new group continued sessions at Criteria Studios in Miami Florida with Tom Dowd as producer During this time Duane Allman joined the group and one of the greatest rock albums of all time Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs came from this work

The group took time off in August of 1971 to help George Harrison in the Concert for Bangladesh Artists that were present at that concert included Bob Dylan Billy Preston Ringo Starr Leon Russell Jim Keltner and many others 

Derek and the Dominoes began work for another group of songs but disliking the new songs and the tensions between the band the band ended For the next three years Radle continued session work on projects with artists such as Art Garfunkel Duane Allman John Lee Hooker Rita Collidge Leon Russell Bobby Whitlock Donovan and Freddie King

In April of 1974 Eric Clapton returned recovered from a heroin addiction and formed a new band Its members including Radle George Terry Jaime Oldaker Dick Sims and Yvonne Elliman on vocals The group recorded again at Criteria Studios under Dowds production to create the album 461 Ocean Boulevard Radle arranged the track Motherless Children for the same album For the next five years Claptons group along with Radle worked closely together on many very successful gold and platinum albums 

By the second half of 1970s Radles health had started to turn bad mostly from his large amount of drinking and drug use In 1978 Clapton broke up the band and all the musicians went on to other things Radle worked for awhile with Peter Frampton but returned to Tulsa On May 30 1980 Radle died at age 37 of problems from a kidney infection caused by his alcoholism and drug addiction At the time his passing was barely noticed by Claptons fans or the music press

Nineteen Eighty Four is a novel written by George Orwell in 1948 The main character is Winston Smith who lives in Oceania under the rule of The Party and Big Brother He becomes friends with the character OBrien He also falls in love with Julia who hates Big Brother and The Party

Winstons job is to change or rectify printed news stories and articles No one in Oceania can look at the old changes They are not allowed to even think about them again or else they will be in big trouble This is called thoughtcrime Thoughtcrime and Facecrime are punished by death Another thing they are trying to do is cut all the hard words out of the English language They are changing it to make it more simple so that people will not be too clever or think too much They are not allowed to have families Other people who live on the outside of the system have more freedoms They are called proles There is an endless war going on with another nation Eurasia In other parts of the world large wars are being fought to keep the people busy The sides in the wars sometimes change When this happens they pretend there was no change and that the sides were always the same This means that all the articles will have to be changed by people like Winston who are not supposed to think about what they are doing When news is rectified the old copies are destroyed

Orwell got the idea for the book when he saw in the newspapers of London that they listed how much the countrys supplies increased during World War II when they were actually very low on supplies and were getting smaller With his knowledge of communism after living in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for five years he started writing a political satire of the possible condition of Britain in 50 years He wrote the book over several years finishing mostly in Jura Scotland finally sending the manuscript to his publishers in December 1948 

The book was not an attack on socialism which Orwell supported but on communism He once wrote quoteEvery line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written directly or indirectly against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism as I understand it Later he repeated that idea writing about 1984 quoteas a show up of the perversions  which have already been partly realized in Communism and Fascism 

At the end of Nineteen Eighty Four Winston is taken to the Ministry of Love This is the prison of Oceania While he is there he is tortured and constantly watched by four telescreens which he can not escape from The only place he is safe is in his own mind Soon he loses control over it as well At the start he thought that OBrien was an ally against the Party This is not true because OBrien is his questioner He thinks OBrien betrayed him So that he is not executed Winston must answer many questions He also worried about the bond of love he made with Julia He is not sure if she betrayed him or not In the end Winston is faced with his worst fear a cage filled with rats which can eat his face He then breaks down He dies as only another member of the Party

Details of the Endless War

Newspeak is a fictional language that appears in the book Nineteen Eighty Four It is the official language of Oceania At the end of his book George Orwell described Newspeak It started out as the English language but the number of words gets smaller each year The Party are trying to stop people from rebelling so it destroys words like freedom and love saying that people can not think of it if there is no word for it In the society this is supposed to prevent thoughtcrime which is thinking against the Party or thinking about the past For example a person could not say I want to be free because there was no word for free any more so the person could not describe what he or she was feeling At the time it was supposed to make fun of politically correctfactdateApril 2009 speech and thoughtcrime made fun of censorship Newspeak is also used for military reasons such as Oceanias Ministry of Peace really the war department Words like Peace Truth Love and Plenty were used in Newspeak a lot to mean their exact opposites Another Newspeak word joycamp means forced labor camp Other Newspeak words were used for political reasons Words like crimethink were defined by the Party and became laws of the land

Book magazine ranked the character of Big Brother as 59 on its 100 Best Characters in Fiction Since 1900 list

He was known for his honesty integrity and having a firm stance against corruption He believed in small government He used the presidential veto power over 500 times far more than most other presidents to reject bills he disagreed with He did not want the United States to get its military involved in Latin America

A bassist is a musician whose musical instrument is a bass guitar or a double bass In rock pop country metal jazz fusion and funk music most bassists play a bass guitar In some types of jazz and in rockabilly bluegrass and in symphony orchestras bassists play a double bass

Many professional rock pop country metal and funk rockabilly and bluegrass bassists learn to play by performing in groups for many years and by taking private lessons with bass teachers 

Bassists who play in symphony orchestras or who play jazz or jazz fusion often learn to play the bass in a conservatory music school college or university College or university degrees in double bass include the Bachelor of Music degree and the Master of Music degree

There are fewer Bass players than traditional guitar players Some believe the bass is harder to play although it has fewer strings

Bassists like other musicians have a much lower average income than many other job categories such as accountants or administrators Although a tiny number of famous bassists make a large amount of money and a small number of bassists have full time jobs in bands or orchestras most bassists have low incomes Many bassists do not earn enough from playing so they do other music related jobs such as teaching bass

Fascism is a kind of government In fascism the country is considered more important than any one person group or liberty A country under this kind of government is always run by a person called a dictator who has the right of total control over the government and people Fascist leadership might also be similar to an oligarchy such as in Italy where the fascist party was ruled by its grand council

Fascism appeared in Europe before World War II because many people were afraid of communism and they thought that democracy was too weak to defend them Fascism was supposed to be the answer for that need while also pursuing an opposition to capitalismwhich supposedly weakened and divided the nation much like democracy and socialism did Believers in Marxism on the contrary believed that capitalism either creates or uses fascism to destroy the workers movements and secure rule by the upper classes

Fascist governments are different from communist ones in that fascists in theory support the right of labor representatives and corporate representatives to negotiate  through a system called corporatism while communism in theory calls for complete economic control and ownership of the economy Most regimes that have been called communist or fascist were really state capitalist systems Instead they usually work closely with people who already manage these things but use the resources to build up the army or other parts of the fascist state It is very important to fascists that all schools in the country teach children that the state is the most important thing in the world All adults are expected to either join the fascist party or support it as the government Some governments considered to be fascist similar to the Nazis in Germany pursued racist policies of segregation andor extermination in opposition to cultural and ethnic pluralism

It is always a big crime in fascist countries to speak against the leader or ruling party Fascist leaders almost always give themselves a high military rank or appear in public in an army or navy uniform because fascist countries consider the army the most important part of the government

The first fascist government was run by Benito Mussolini in Italy from 1922 until 1943 The governments of Engelbert Dollfuss in Austria and Adolf Hitler in Germany are also referred to as fascist but this is not completely accurate Other examples are Greece under Joannis Metaxas Spain under the rule of Francisco Franco and Portugal when Antnio de Oliveira Salazar was the head of the government All of these governments were much like Italian fascism especially before and during World War II

Some might say Imperial Japan under Hideki TojoFactsubst12242008 was a fascist state but some people might just say it was a Constitutional monarchy that followed Nationalism and Militarism 

Fascism is named after the fasces which is an old Roman Empire name for a group of sticks tied together It is easy to break one stick in half It is very hard to break many sticks tied together in half Fascists think that everyone following the same leader makes the country strong the same way the sticks are

In countries led by fascist governments the government tries to control all areas of life including work school and family life Fascist ideas were most common around the time of World War II Many people were killed by fascist governments because the government did not like them or because they opposed fascism Even more were killed in wars started by fascist governments However the fascist governments of Portugal and Spain did not take part in World War II and stayed in power until the 1970s Many scholars consider these governments to have been or evolved into traditionalist and conservative rather than fascist Fascism while supporting order and stability as conservatism does wants to transform society in new ways

After World War II Fascism lost much of its influence although movements and politicians inspired by Fascism have had success in several countries such as Italy

An erection of a body part such as a mans penis a womans clitoris or a nipple refers to it becoming larger and harder 

The term erection is most often used to refer to an erection of the penis A mans penis needs to be erect in order for him to take part in sexual intercourse and penetrate his partners vagina and to ejaculate semen For an erection to take place a man must be sexually aroused or stimulated This can happen if he is touched sexually or even if he is not touched for example if he sees a naked person or thinks about having sex with someone else Tissues in the penis called the corpus spongiosum penis and corpora cavernosa penis fill with blood causing the penis to become longer thicker harder and to stand upright A mans erection usually stops if he is no longer sexually aroused or after he has had an orgasm and has ejaculated Blood flows out of the corpus spongiosum and corpora cavernosa penis and the penis goes back to its normal size A man who often has problems having or keeping an erection of his penis is said to have erectile dysfunction On the other hand an erection that lasts too long is also a dangerous condition called priapism

Erect penises have appeared in erotic art for a very long time Pictures of men with erections appear on ancient objects and in paintings In the past the erect penis was also a symbol or sign of health and fertility Ancient Egyptians Greeks and Romans believed in gods that had erect penises Today erect penises do not often appear in artworks or movies because many people think that showing a mans penis when it is erect is obscene Men with larger penises are often thought to be more handsome manly and powerful A lot of people also believe that men with bigger penises are better at making their partners feel good when they are having sex However this is not always true

Like a mans penis a womans clitoris can also become erect This happens in the same way as an erection of the penis The clitoris also has a corpus spongiosum and corpus cavernosum and when a woman is sexually excited these parts of the clitoris fill with blood This causes the clitoris and other parts of the womans sex organs to become larger harder redder in colour and very sensitive to being touched An erection of the clitoris that does not go away after a long time is a medical problem called clitorism

The nipples of men and women can also become erect Womens nipples become erect when they are breastfeeding Men and women may also have an erection of their nipples when they are sexually excited or if they feel cold Nipples do not have any tissue in them that fills with blood Instead the bodys nervous system makes muscles in the nipples contract causing them to stand up and become slightly harder

The term erection is most often used to refer to an erection of the penis A mans penis is usually soft quite short and hangs down When the penis is like this it is said to be flaccid In order for the man to take part in sexual intercourse by putting his penis inside a womans vagina his penis needs to become longer thicker harder and to stand upright When this happens it is said that the penis is erect or that the man has an erection The penis needs to be erect before the man can have an orgasm and ejaculate semen

The scientific name for an erection is tumescence Some slang terms for having an erection are getting hard getting wood and having a hard on and an erect penis is informally called a boner hard on stiffy wood or woody

The penis is shaped like a banana or sausage It has a duct or tube called the urethra running right through it Semen and urine pass along the urethra to get out of the body Around the whole urethra is tissue called the corpus spongiosum penis It is near the lower surface of the penis Also inside the penis near its upper surface are two cylindrical tissues called the corpora cavernosa penis The corpus spongiosum penis and corpora cavernosa penis are filled with many blood vessels called arteries which carry blood

When a man is sexually aroused or stimulated by touch for example if he masturbates or another person touches him in a sexual way the touching is picked up by nerves in the arteries of the corpus spongiosum penis and corpora cavernosa penis The nerves then cause a chemical called nitric oxide to be released into the arteries This makes the arteries dilate and they fill up with blood Thus the corpus spongiosum penis and corpora cavernosa penis all fill with blood and become larger and harder This makes the penis grow longer thicker and harder The corpora cavernosa penis press against blood vessels called veins that let blood flow out of the penis Since less blood can flow out of the penis through the veins more of it stays in the penis which remains hard During an erection a valve stops urine from entering the urethra so that only semen flows along it This is why it is very difficult for a man to urinate when he is having an erection

A man can also become sexually aroused without being touched for example if he sees a naked person or thinks about having sex with someone In this case his brain sends messages through his spinal cord to his penis and makes an erection happen The brain can also stop an erection from happening even if the man is being touched sexually

An erection of the penis can also happen by itself when a man is asleep often when he is dreaming The scientific term for this is nocturnal penile tumescence It is also common for a man to wake up after a nights sleep to find that he has an erection This is often caused by his bladder being full of urine which presses on the tissues in the penis Such an erection is sometimes informally called a morning glory or morning wood

After a man has had an orgasm and has ejaculated his erection usually ends How long this takes depends on the length and thickness of his penis A man can also stop having an erection without having an orgasm and ejaculating if he is no longer sexually aroused Nerves in his body cause the arteries in the penis to constrict This forces blood out of the corpus spongiosum penis and corpora cavernosa penis As they go back to their normal size they do not press so much on the veins leading out of the penis This lets blood flow faster out of the corpus spongiosum penis and corpora cavernosa penis The scientific term for this process is detumescence

 Shape and size  The angle that an erect penis makes varies from one man to another If it is imagined that a man is standing upright and there is a horizontal line stretching out from the base of his penis most mens erect penises point upwards from the line at a certain angle However it is common and normal for an erect penis to point nearly vertically upwards nearly vertically downwards or even horizontally forward The angle depends on how long a mans suspensory ligament is The suspensory ligament is a band of tough stringy tissue that joins a mans penis to the front of his pelvis

Few mens penises are completely straight when they are erect It is common for an erect penis to have a slight curve in it The curve can be up or down or to the left or right A curve of up to 30 is considered normal and medical treatment is usually not needed unless the angle of curvature is more than 45 A curved penis does not usually cause a man any problems when he is having sex However if the curvature of a penis changes this could be caused by an illness called Peyronies disease

A survey of 300 men over the age of 18 carried out between 11 March and 17 March 2001 in Cancn Mexico found that among those men the average erect human penis was about 14928 centimetres long and that most of them had an erect penis length of between 14 and 16 centimetres The typical girth or circumference was about 1263 centimetres and most erect penises had a girth of between 12 and 13 centimetres As this survey was only done in one city its findings may not apply to men from other countries

The size of an erect penis generally does not change after puberty the time when a boy becomes sexually mature Some people have surgery to make their penises larger However a study that came out in 2006 found that only 35 of men who had gone for such surgery were happy with the results

A man who often has problems having or keeping an erection of his penis is said to have erectile dysfunction Erectile dysfunction is also known as ED impotence or male impotence The study of erectile dysfunction comes within andrology the field of science dealing with mens health

ED is not uncommon For example about 10 of all men in the United Kingdom will have ED happening to them regularly at some time in their lives It can be due to both physiological and psychological reasons Physiological reasons are those dealing with how the body works Psychological reasons are those involving human behaviour and how people think

These are some common physiological reasons for ED

ED can also happen for psychological reasons For example a man can find it difficult to have an erection

Having erections is seen by many people as a very important part of being a man Therefore a man who has ED often feels that he is not manly enough and not successful in life This can lead to him feeling ashamed and not as good as other men The matter is made worse because men often do not like talking about their personal problems with other people so they keep their unhappy feelings to themselves However talking to a doctor or psychiatrist is helpful as he or she may be able to suggest ways of dealing with the problem

How ED may be treated depends on the cause If it is caused by a disease sometimes treating the disease will reduce the problem For example if a man is unable to have erections because his body does not make enough testosterone he can be given pills to take which help his body to do so If the blood vessels or nerves in the corpora cavernosa penis are damaged a full cure may not be possible However there are some temporary treatments that allow a man to have an erection for long enough to have sex

If a mans erection lasts for more than four hours even though he is no longer sexually excited this is a medical problem called priapism The condition is named after the Greek god Priapus whose penis was believed to always be erect Priapism is painful and is a medical emergency because the blood stuck in the penis can become thick and form clots This can damage the blood vessels of the penis and lead to erectile dysfunction In serious cases the tissues of the penis can die and the penis may have to be amputated so that the tissue death does not spread to the rest of the body

It is not really known what causes priapism Men who suffer from priapism sometimes have blood diseases like leukemia or sickle cell disease Problems with the nervous system such as injury to the spinal cord or abnormal growths on it can also lead to priapism Certain medicines can make priapism happen including some used to treat ED such as alprostadil A 2008 study suggests that too much of the chemical adenosine in the body may cause priapism since it makes blood vessels widen which lets more blood flow into the penis

When a man with priapism is brought to the emergency department of a hospital a doctor will usually try to remove blood from the corpora cavernosa penis by aspirating it using a syringe If this is not enough a chemical called phenylephrine may be injected into the penis to try and make the blood vessels become narrower If this also does not work the doctor will make a shunt between the corpora cavernosa penis and corpus spongiosum penis This allows blood to flow away from the corpora cavernosa penis into the corpus spongiosum penis For men who have priapism again and again it has been found that medicines such as sildenafil and tadalafil may help

When an erect penis is shown in art it is often called a phallus Erotic art has shown phalluses for a very long time Pictures of men with erections appear on ancient objects and in paintings

The erect penis was also a symbol or sign of health and fertility The Hohle Fels phallus was found in a cave in Germany It is a piece of stone carved to look like a penis that archaeologists believe is about 28000 years old From the fourth millennium BC Ancient Egyptians worshipped Min as the god of reproduction and the maker of all things Min was shown in statues and on wall carvings as having an erect penis

The Ancient Greeks believed in a god called Priapus who had a very large penis that was always erect He was thought to protect livestock fruit plants and gardens and mens sex organs He was also seen as able to chase away evil and as a protector of sailors fishermen and others needing good luck 

Long after the Roman Empire ended and many people became Christian Priapus was still seen as a symbol of health and fertility A 13th century book called the Lanercost Chronicle which is a history of northern England and Scotland talks about someone putting up a statue of Priapus to try and stop a disease from spreading among cattle 

Some Native Americans in the Southwestern United States believe in a fertility god called Kokopelli who is in charge of childbirth and agriculture He also plays tricks and is a symbol for the spirit of music Kokopelli is sometimes shown as a man playing a flute with a humpback things like feathers sticking out from his head and a very big penis

Today phalluses do not often appear in artworks or movies This is because many people think that showing a mans penis when it is erect is obscene

Men with larger penises are commonly thought to be more handsome manly and powerful In 2006 it was reported that an Internet survey of 52031 heterosexual men and women showed that men who thought that their penises were larger than the average size believed they were more good looking Of the men 55 of them were happy with their penis size but 45 wanted to be larger Only 02 wanted a smaller penis On the other hand 85 of women were happy with how big their partners penis was Another study that also came out in 2006 in the Netherlands found that out of 251 homosexual men who were asked most felt it was better to have a large penis and those who thought they had one were happy about their bodies However just because a man has a large penis does not always mean he is sexier or stronger than other men even though many people think this

A lot of people also believe that men with bigger penises are better at making their partners feel good when they are having sex For heterosexual men this is because it is thought that when the penis can go further into the vagina this helps the woman have a better orgasm Scientists are not sure whether this is true or not Some research shows that the most sensitive area of the female sex organs includes the vulva clitoris and the part of the vagina nearest the outside of a womans body There are also parts of the clitoris inside the vulva and vagina Therefore most mens penises are long enough to make their partners feel good during sex Also some studies say it is not how long but how thick a penis is that decides how well it excites a woman sexually

However other research seems to say that a long penis that touches and sexually excites the fornix which is the deepest part of the vagina near the cervix helps a woman to have an orgasm A study from the Netherlands of 375 women came out in 2002 This study said that although 77 of the women felt that the length of a mans penis was not important to them quite a large number 21 felt it was important

The clitoris is part of a womans sex organs It makes a womans orgasms happen which gives her very good sexual feelings Like a mans penis a womans clitoris also becomes bigger and harder when she is sexually excited However because the clitoris is much smaller than the penis and most of the clitoris is inside the womans body and cannot be seen from the outside a clitoral erection cannot be seen as well as an erection of the penis

An erection of the clitoris happens in the same way as an erection of the penis The clitoris has a corpus cavernosum similar to the penis However instead of the corpus spongiosum it has two vestibular bulbs When a woman is sexually excited the corpus cavernosum and vestibular bulbs fill with blood This causes the clitoris and other parts of the womans sex organs to become larger harder and redder in colour When this happens they become very sensitive to being touched

If an erection of the clitoris does not go away after a long time even though the woman is not being made sexually excited any more this is a medical problem called clitorism Like priapism which can affect a mans penis it is painful A woman who thinks she may have clitorism should see a doctor

The nipples of men and women can also become erect Womens nipples become erect when they are breastfeeding Men and women may also have an erection of their nipples when they are sexually excited This is caused by the release of a hormone called oxytocin in the body Nipples can also become erect when a person feels cold

Unlike the penis and clitoris nipples do not have any tissue in them that fills with blood Instead the bodys nervous system makes muscles in the nipples contract causing them to stand up and become slightly harder

Meth can be in powder or crystal form and can be snorted smoked injected or eaten In its smokeable form meth is known as ice crystal crank or glass

With the snorting method the meth crystals are ground up and made into little lines and inhaled through the nose with rolled up paper rolled up dollar bills or an empty plastic pen tube

In this method the effects of meth last longer than in the smoking or injecting method In fact in this method the effects of meth can last as long as twelve hours However the effect takes longer to feel than smoking or injecting and there is not as strong of a rush Snorting meth can be damaging to the nasal septum on the inside of the nose Also if people share the same snorting tube they can get infections

The crystals are placed into a pipe or a hollowed out lightbulb and warmed up from underneath by a flame The Crystal Meth is not actually smoked this way but heated up until it melts When it melts it turns into a gas that is then sucked into the users lungs and held in Smoking gives one of the fastest onset of the happy feeling and the strongest happy feeling However the vapor can damage the lungs and smoking is more addictive than snorting or eating

The crystal meth can be mixed with water and warmed up then put into a needle and injected Injecting gives one of the fastest onset of the happy feeling and the strongest happy feeling However it can damage the body it is very addictive and people can get infections from dirty needles

If the crystal meth is eaten it gets absorbed into the body from the digestive system

If people use meth they may take too much and get sick or even die This is called an overdose Also when people take meth they can become aggressive Long term diseases include Parkinsons disease and Alzheimers disease In fact a teenager taking meth can show symptoms similar to Alzheimers

Crystal Meth is highly addictive because of the come down as the drugs effect begins to wear off Many users claim to have an uncontrollable urge to get more of the drug after using this effect of the drug is part of the reason methamphetamine can be so addictive  

Sharing needles among users will increase the chance of getting infections or diseases Getting high on crystal meth can also increase ones libido

Meth Mouth is a term used to describe the tooth deterioration caused by smoking meth Meth mouth destruction can be quick  a new addict can go from having healthy teeth to total tooth loss in as little as one year

Decay starts on the cheek side of the smooth surfaces of the teeth and the areas between the front teeth

Meth mouth is caused by many things The vapors of meth contain several harsh chemicals that dry out the salivary glands This makes the mouth dry When the mouth is dry the number of bacteria in the mouth increases This leads to cavities

The Caribbean or Caribbean Area is a region of the Americas It includes the Caribbean Sea its islands and the coasts of north South America and east Central America

The Caribbean is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to its east and north the coast of South America to its south the coast of Central America to its southwest and by the Gulf of Mexico to its northwest

The West Indies is the name for the group of the islands of the Bahamas and the Antilles The Antilles are divided into two groups the larger Greater Antilles on the north limit of the Caribbean Sea and the Lesser Antilles on the east and south

The Caribbean islands have many different types of land Because of this the islands have many different kinds of plants and animals even uncommon ones

Famous islands in the Caribbean include Cuba Jamaica Puerto Rico and Hispaniola The countries of Dominican Republic and Haiti are on Hispaniola There is also a lot of white sandy beaches and hot sun there

The name Caribbean comes from Carib indigenous people living in the Lesser Antilles and north South America when the Europeans came to the Americas

The 18th century saw many countries trying to colonize the islands Because of this Caribbean culture is very similar to those of Africa India and many countries in Europe

The Caribbean Sea is a tropical sea in the center of the Caribbean area The body of water is part of the Atlantic Ocean The sea is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico The Caribbean Sea has many islands which are popular among North American tourists because of their tropical climate

Gibraltar is an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom This means it shares the British King or Queen and has the protection of the British military It lies in southwest Europe on the Mediterranean Sea It has a population of about 28000 people who are called Gibraltarians

Gibraltar has always been important as a military base because this is where the Mediterranean Sea narrows to only 14 kilometres at the Strait of Gibraltar This meant that whichever country controlled Gibraltar could see all ships that came into the Mediterranean Sea 

Gibraltar is most famous for the The Rock of Gibraltar a 426 meter high limestone rock rising out of the sea The rock can be seen for many miles It is home to the Barbary Apes a type of tail less monkey which are the only wild monkey in Europe

Gibraltar belonged to Spain between the years 1501 and 1704 and was captured by a group of Dutch and British marines during the War of the Spanish Succession In 1713 Spain signed papers called the Treaty of Utrecht These papers said Gibraltar would be British permanently However according to this treaty if the Crown of Great Britain ever wants to leave the territory the Crown of Spain will have a prior position in order to claim the sovereignty

Gibraltar was very important in World War II Since it was in such a good position it was the perfect place for the British In World War II the people were taken to different parts of the world like Jamaica so they could be protected from the war and also leave the Rock for the soldiers The Rock of Gibraltar was used by these soldiers and long tunnels were made inside it These tunnels even had a hospital and living areas for the soldiers 

Since 1704 when Spain lost Gibraltar Spain began trying to get it back They besieged the Rock several times in the 18th century However since the 1950s Spain has tried get Gibraltar by diplomacy by putting different kinds of pressure and restrictions on the people of Gibraltar

In 1969 Britain gave Gibraltar a new constitution This meant that it gave the people of Gibraltar a large amount of self government 

In 2002 the people of Gibraltar were asked to vote whether they wanted Spain to share Gibraltar with the United Kingdom almost everyone voted and 9897 said they did not 

In 2006 Gibraltar voted to approve a new constitution which gave full self government to the people

Spain stopped interfering with Gibraltar telephone lines and daily flights to Madrid started

The Seven Wonders of the World is a widely known list of seven great buildings or structures from the classical time period

 Seven Wonders of the Ancient World Do not trust this information

This is a list put together in the second century BC by Antipater of Sidon and Philon of Byzantium This explains why it only lists monuments of the Mediterranean world There are other slightly different version this is the most usual one

Out of those structures only the Great Pyramid still exists in the 21st century Most of the wonders were built by the Greeks Earlier versions listed the Walls of Babylon and the Palace of Cyrus the Great

The Seven Wonders of the Modern World were decided by the American Society of Civil Engineers However some other variations of the list exist

They are

The whale shark Rhincodon typus is a slow moving filter feeding shark the largest living fish species 

The largest confirmed individual was Convert1265mft2 in length The heaviest weighed more than Convert36tlb Unconfirmed claims report larger individuals 

This distinctively marked fish is the only member of its genus Rhincodon and its family Rhincodontidae It belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes 

The shark is found in tropical and warm oceans and has a lifespan of about 70 years 

Although whale sharks have very large mouths they feed mainly on plankton microscopic plants and animals The BBC program Planet Earth filmed a whale shark feeding on a school of small fish

The species was discovered in April 1828 following the harpooning of a 46 metre specimen in Table Bay South Africa Andrew Smith a military doctor with British troops stationed in Cape Town described it the next year He published a more detailed description in 1849 The name whale shark comes from the fishs physiology as large as a whale it too is a filter feeder

A herring is a small teleost fish of the genus Cluptea Best known of this family is probably the Atlantic Herring There are 15 different species of herring When herrings migrate in the water they usually do this in large numbers this is then called a school of herring Like other fish they do this for protection see shoaling and schooling 

Herrings can be eaten Usual ways to make food from herring is to smoke or pickle it 

A red herring is used to describe a plot device in mystery fiction that leads the reader to a wrong solution

The rays are a group of Batoid cartilaginous fish containing more than 500 described species in thirteen families The batoids include four orders 

They are mostly flattened in shape and usually demersal living and eating at the bottom of the sea The group first appears in the Triassic period after 95 of marine species had been wiped out by the PTr extinction event

Rays look like bats in the water and this is probably why they are called batoids They have pectoral fins that are attached to their bodies from back to front similar to the way a bats wings attach from its shoulder to its feet 

The fins of the ray create a disk shape that can be round triangular or diamond shaped Rays use their pectoral fins to fly through the water Though a bony fish takes in water with its mouth rays do not because they live at the bottom of the ocean If they took in water through their mouths they would probably just get a mouthful of sand Because of this they have breathing holes on top of their bodies called spiracles Rays use spiracles to take in water that is then sent over the gills 

Also because they do not have a swim bladder rays sink when they are not actively swimming

Interestingly rays are usually curious and social animals Though they often live alone they like swimming together in groups with other rays Despite the fact that they are able to swim most rays live at the bottom of the sea eating benthic animals In fact they often flick sand on their backs to camouflage themselves as they lie in the sand at the bottom of the ocean

Fishing hook is a hook used to catch fish There are many types of fishing hooks Most have a sharp point which sticks into the fish when it is caught There are lots of types of fishing hooks and they all depend on how powerful they can hold the line and the size

Many hooks have different sizes for different fish

A fishing rod is a tool used for catching fish This is the way people catch fish for fun or sport commercial fishing is usually done using fishing nets

A fishing rod is basically a line with bait on it fixed on a pole There is usually some way to make the line longer or shorter and the pole it is fixed on can bend a little

The cell membrane is a thin flexible layer around the cells of all living things It is sometimes called the plasma membrane 

Its basic job is to separate the inside from the outside In all cells the cell membrane separates the protoplasm inside the cell from its surroundings In animal cells that is all there is Bacteria fungi and plants have cell walls as well which support the cell and block the passage of large molecules

The membrane is made up of a thin layer called the phospholipid bilayer This has two layers of phospholipid molecules with phosphate heads on the surfaces and lipid tails on the inside The outside heads mix with water but the tails reject water

Other proteins and lipids can be added to the cell membrane By these changes the cell can adjust what it brings in or puts out Some proteins are always stuck into it these are called integral membrane proteins It also has some which are only sometimes stuck onto it These are called peripheral membrane proteins

The cell membrane is active and regulates what comes in and what goes out of the cell The movement of substances across the membrane can be either passive occurring without the input of cellular energy or active requiring energy 

Proteins within the membrane are key to its working These proteins mainly transport chemicals and information across the membrane 

The membrane contains many proteins The surface proteins can act as gates They let some chemicals into the cell and let other chemicals leave the cell It is estimated that up to a third of the human proteome may be membrane proteins Some of these proteins are linked to the exterior of the cell membrane An example of this is the CD59 protein which identifies cells as self and thus inhibits their destruction by the immune system

Morocco is a country in north Africa Its official name is the Kingdom of Morocco

Morocco is a constitutional monarchy However most of the political powers are in the hands of king Muhammad VI He is the head of state and the most important person His authority is unquestionable 

The people of Morocco vote for Members of Parliament to speak for them and to help make laws for them The king defines what must be done and gives orders to all the ministers and the army officers He makes all the important decisions but he leaves the small details to the ministers and the low ranking officers The second most important person in Morocco is the Prime Minister who is in charge of the government although he received orders from the king as well Today the Prime Minister is Abbas AlFassi He was chosen by the king after the elections

Morocco is next to the countries of Algeria to its east and Western Sahara to its south The Mediterranean Sea lies to the north of Morocco and the Atlantic Ocean to the west

Morocco has a diverse geography from fertile plains to forests cold mountains dry lands and deserts Most people live in areas close to the coast or in fertile farms Morocco has an area of 446550 km Morocco also controls most of the Western Sahara which is 266000 km big

The capital of Morocco is Rabat About 12 million people live in Rabat The biggest city in Morocco is however Casablanca with nearly 4 million people living there Both Rabat and Casablanca have large ports and industrial zones The third biggest city is Marrakesh from which the word Morocco is made

The population of Morocco is about 34 million People from Morocco are called Moroccans Moroccans are essentially Berbers just like their neighbors the Algerians and Libyans Although many of the Moroccans have Arab Spanish black African and Jewish ancestors 

The official language of Morocco is Arabic but millions of Moroccans also speak the Berber language and want it to be official too French is also used but only in big companies universities and in some TV channels Morocco used to be occupied by France for 44 years Some people in the north speak Spanish as well Spain also occupied parts of Morocco before leaving them in 1956 and in 1975

Most educated Moroccans do not speak English well or do not know it at all But since recent years English is being taught to students in an increasing number of schools

Most Moroccans follow Islam as their religion There are very small numbers of Christians Jews and non believers

Mining agriculture fishing and tourism are the 4 main parts of Moroccos national economy Also Moroccans working in Europe send billions of Euros of money home to their families every year 

Tourism is becoming very important too Many Americans and Europeans come to see the historical places of Morocco live the Berber countryside life or enjoy the warm sun and the long and clean beaches Marrakesh is the most liked city by tourists

The currency of Morocco is called the Dirham its code is MAD

Starfish or sea stars are Echinoderms of the Class Asteroideap35

All live in the ocean on the sea floor Some live in deep water others in shallow water Some live in the intertidal zone between low and high tide They have five or more arms and can be quite large The Sunflower sea star is the largest fully grown its arm span is about a metre This is a bit larger than the famous Crown of thorns starfish which lives on coral polyps

Although starfish are invertebrates they do have a kind of skeleton The bodies of starfish are composed of calcium carbonate plates known as ossicles These form the endoskeleton which takes on a variety of forms such as spines and granules 

They have a primitive nervous system but not a brain They also do not have blood instead they use sea water to pump things around their bodies

There are over 1500 different species of sea star Most sea stars are predators They eat mussels clams and other bivalves Occasionally they catch small fish

Most starfish have five arms called rays that come out from a center circle If a starfish has more than five rays it will often have rays in multiples of five there could be 10 15 20 or even 30 rays on one starfish This is called pentameral symmetry

The degree of protection offered by the skeleton differs between species If the skeleton becomes more rigid it offers better protection against predators However this will tend to limit its feeding alternatives Great flexibility is required for the process of external digestion used by many species to eat bivalves The less well armoured species may adopt a life in places where they are not so open to predation The heavily armoured ones can tough it out in the most competitive habitats

The movement of starfish is guided by their senses of touch and sight There are five eyes light sensitive cushions one at the end of each arm These and the tube feet are connected to nerve fibres so these animals are more complex than might appear

Although starfish started off as filter feeders they evolved to become major predators of shell fish They can also eat small crustacea and fish Their tube feet developed suckers perhaps originally to improve movement Later they were used to open shell fish

The shells of brachiopods and bivalves are held together by strong muscles What the starfish does is clamp hold of them on either side with its tube feet and apply a steady pull The starfish with its muscles and hydraulic system can pull for much longer than any bivalve muscle can withstand Apparently ten minutes are usually enough to open the shell a bit Then the starfish slips its stomach inside the shell The stomach can get through a slot as narrow as 01mm The starfish then dissolves the mollusc where it lives absorbing the nutrients This digestion process takes much longer than opening the shell perhaps a couple of days

Sometimes species swallow the shell whole and dissolves the contents inside their stomach then push out the shell afterwardsp45

This ability of starfish appeared to develop in the Mesozoic especially in the Jurassic and Cretaceous This was part of the Mesozoic Marine Revolution which transformed the sea floor fauna Weakly defended and static types disappeared and more heavily armoured or more mobile shellfish flourished

Starfish like many sea creatures are able to regenerate parts of their bodies Starfish are better at regeneration than most other creatures Not only can a new ray grow when a ray is torn off but if the torn off ray has even a small piece of the central disk still attached a whole new starfish can grow from the one rayp35

Because starfish like to eat clams and oysters fishermen who gather shellfish have tried for years to get rid of them To kill the starfish fishermen would catch them slice them right in half and throw them back in the ocean However because starfish can grow back parts of their bodies they were actually increasing the number of starfish

Gregorian calendar switch The year 1582 involved conversion to the Gregorian calendar It had only 355 days It began as a common year starting on Monday in accordance with the Julian calendar It continued as normal through Thursday October 4 But the next day it became October 15 in Italy Poland Portugal and Spain Other countries continued to use the Julian calendar switching over to the Gregorian in later years 

Jellyfish are animals of the phylum Cnidaria They eat small sea animals like plankton and float in the sea Only a few jellyfish live in fresh water 

They have soft bodies and long stinging poisonous tentacles that they use to catch fish Venom is injected by stinging cells called nematocysts A jellyfish is 98 water

Their bodies are made of 98 water A jellyfish has a bell shaped body and long tentacles at the underside of the body Tentacles are long arms with special stinging cells called nematocysts They move by contracting moves of their bell but they cannot decide where to go on their own Most of the time they drift with the water current The most common type of jellyfish is a Lions Mane Jellyfish These jellyfish have tentacles that can be as long as 60 meters

Jellyfish occur in four of the Cnidarian classes

These four classes are sometimes linked as the sub phylum Medusozoa

There are many types of jellyfish The smallest jellyfish are just a few inches across The largest jellyfish is the Lions mane whose body can be over 3 feet across with much longer tentacles Some jellyfish broken wikt linkglowglow in the dark Some of the most dangerous jelly fish include the box jelly and the tiny two cm across Irukandji jelly the venomous sting of these jellyfish can kill a person

Many animals eat jellyfish including sea turtles and some fish

Most jellyfish undergo two distinct life history stages during their life cycle The first is the polypoid stage when the animal takes the form of a small stalk with feeding tentacles this polyp may be unable to move around living on the bottom of the ocean or it may be free floating Polyps generally have a mouth surrounded by upward facing tentacles Polyps may be on their own or in groups and some bud asexually by various means making more polyps Most are very small measured in millimeters

In the second stage the tiny polyps asexually produce jellyfish each of which is also known as a medusa Tiny jellyfish swim away from the polyp and then grow and feed in the plankton Medusae have a radially symmetric umbrella shaped body called a bell which is usually supplied with marginal tentacles that capture prey A few species of jellyfish do not have the polyp portion of the life cycle but go from jellyfish to the next generation of jellyfish through direct development of fertilized eggs

Jellyfish eat plankton and little fish which are caught by their poisonous tentacles Jellyfish may live in symbiosis with algae The jellyfish transports them into sunlight and get nutrients from the algaes photosynthesis Both forms of jelly fish have small tentacles with nematocysts that sting and can hurt people on contact

Tilapia is a fish that is often farmed for food or kept as pets in aquariums They live in warm fresh water but some species live in brackish water The fish are found in Africa North and South America India and Sri Lanka

They are listed as one of the worlds worst introduced species They can quickly take over from native fish in rivers This has happened in places like in the Endeavour River in  Queensland Australia These fish are thought to have been released into the river from an aquarium

Sardine is a name of several kinds of fish especially oily fish Another name for these fish is Pilchard All of those fish are quite small and are related to the herring The Latin name of the family of these fish is Clupeidae However the naming is not precise Fishbase a database about all kinds of fish has six species just named pilchard There are over a dozen with the name of sardine Many more exist with the basic names qualified by adjectives

The fish are named after the Island of Sardinia In the past they could easily be fished there

Many shops and supermarkets sell canned sardines Very often those fish are not sardines but rather sprats or round herrings 

Bones are parts of the human or animal skeleton of vertebrates They are stiff organs which make up the endoskeleton Our body is made of flesh and blood built on a framework of bones Without our bones we could not stand up or move about They also protect organs inside our body The skull protects the brain and the ribs protect the heart and lungs The teeth support the facial muscles and help us smile The number of bones in a humans neck is the same as a giraffes

The bones are the framework of the body Without them we would be a pile of skin on the floor The bones are also very important for our own protection that is the rib cage protects the heart and lungs cranium protects the brain pelvis protects the reproductive organs Bones need to be maintained by taking regular exercise and by having lots of calcium from foods like cheese milk and dark leafy greens such as spinach The red bone marrow in the middle of the bigger bones is what makes the red blood cells that we need

Anteaters are mammals of the family Myrmecophagidae and the suborder Vermilingua Anteaters live in South America and Central America

Anteaters eat ants and termites They have long sharp claws and a long sticky tongue The tongue can be up to 60 cm long as long as a persons arm The anteater opens an ant nest with its claws Then it licks up the ants with its tongue

Sorghum is a genus in the grass family Poaceae The plants are grown in warmer climates Species grow naturally in tropical and subtropical regions of all continents in addition to Oceania and Australasia Because many species of Sorghum are resistant to drought and high temperatures it is a very important food source in the desert areas of Africa 

A Brown Bear is a large bear of the Ursidae family Brown bears live mostly across northern North America and Eurasia

Brown bears can weigh 130700 kg It is the national animal of Finland

There are several Brown Bear subspecies

Polar bear fur consists of a layer of dense underfur and an outer layer of guard hairs which appear white to tan but are actually translucent The fur keeps them very warm They are strong and can swim very well Polar bears are similar in size to a normal bear but have a slimmer neck longer legs and fur

They are mostly carnivorous They eat mostly seals and fish When Polar bears hunt they often wait at holes in the ice where the seals come up to breathe

Polar bears live alone Young Polar bears stay with their mothers for 12 years and they become mature when they are 56 years old People think Polar bears can become 2530 years old in nature but in captivity they can become up to 45 years old

Polar bears live in many nations including five nations as

The babies are born six weeks after their mother mates At birth a baby cub weighs less than 2 pounds The mother feeds the babies milk which makes them grow fast and after 10 weeks the cubs weigh about 20 to 25 pounds Young polar bears wrestle in the snow to build their strength and skills They practice using their strong paws and they show off their big sharp teeth

Mother polar bears will do anything to protect their young They can kill a predator with just one swat of their powerful front paws Scientists have even seen a mother polar bear stand up and leap at a helicopter to keep it away from her cubs

During the first year the cubs begin to eat solid food but still nurse from their mother They begin to learn to hunt and swim But they cant live on their own By the time they are two years old the cubs have grown into large bears They leave their mother and strike off into territory of their own They hunt and live alone But they play with other bears they meet Polar bears are ready to mate when they are five or six years old They are adults by this time and weigh 330 to 660 pounds Both male and female polar bears live to be as much as 30 years old

As adults male bears fight with each other over a female Each male fluffs out his coat of fur to make himself look bigger Then he swaggers along growling to scare off his rival Polar bear scientists call this the cowboy walk

The polar bear was the most dangerous animal to hunt It was also greatly respected for its strength and spirit The bears blubber meat and fur all help the Inuit survive And they gave thanks and respect in turn After a hunt they held a celebration that lasted for several days Then a polar bear dance was held Finally the bears skull was set on an ice floe to release its spirit back into the Arctic

When two polar bears meet they have a special way of greeting each other They circle around each other for a while grunting Then they come closer and touch noses

A polar bears paws are perfect snowshoes for them The bottoms are wide and covered with fur to make them nonslip The sharp claws help grip the ice

A polar bear can crawl across ice too thin for a human to walk on They spread out their legs and lay their bellies flat on the ice Then they use their claws to slowly push themselves across the ice

Polar bears mate in April or May The cub is born in December when the mother is hibernating The cub stays in the den with the mother until March then they all come out They eat immediately after hibernating Sometimes because of global warming this is impossible and the cubs die before they have had a chance to live The cub leaves its mother in 23 years

If you eat too much of any polar bears liver you would die as it contains a lot of Vitamin A and the body can not handle it

Mao Zedong was a Chinese Communist leader He was the leader of the Peoples Republic of China from its establishment in 1949 until his death in 1976 People have different opinions about Mao The reasons people have called him bad are because they blame him for millions of Chinese deaths and say that he was not skilled at running the government They also say that he was impatient and would not wait for things he wanted to achieve But people who agreed with Maos Chinese Communist group say that he was a hero who helped women and peasants gain rights They also say that he saved China from foreign rule

Mao was born on December 26 1893 in the Hunan province of China He grew up in a farming family and became a Communist while working at a library Throughout the 1920s his power increased or became larger in the Communist Party of China and by 1933 he was its leader During the 1920s the group began to fight with rival Chinese leader Chiang Kai shek and his group the Kuomintang This fight was called the Chinese Civil War Mao said that Chiang was corrupt and unfit to rule China Mao also wanted to make China follow communism a way of thinking that opposed private property and supported common ownership

Chiang Kai sheks group the Nationalists had more fighters in 1935 They beat Maos Communists and made them move out of the country The Communists left to a fort that they owned This move was called the Long March Mao escaped from the Nationalists with other Communists to a part of China called Yenan By this time in 1935 the Chinese Civil War caused 500000 deaths

When Japan invaded China in 1937 Mao and Chiang stopped fighting The United States defeated Japan in 1945 and made the Japanese Army leave China The Chinese Civil War had been stopped during World War II but after the war it became very violent Chiang Kai shek and the Nationalists had supporters in the cities and among the middle class Mao and the Communists had many supporters in the farms and the countryside In those days in China there were more farmers than city people so Mao had more supporters than Chiang and others supported Mao because they thought Chiangs government was bad By 1949 Mao had chased the Nationalists to an island called Taiwan and told the people that China would be Communist with him as leader

In the 1950s Mao had many plans for how China could move forward in technology very fast and catch up with countries like the United Kingdom and United States Mao was responsible for the First Five Year Plan and also The Second Five Year Plan The Second Five Year Plan had some ideas that did not work the way that Mao had wanted them to Farms could not produce or make much food because of bad farming plans and cities did not make many things like clothes and machines Because of the lack of food many people died of starvation

In the 1960s Mao wanted to change everything about China such as the way Chinese people thought about China and the way they remembered history Because of this he forced people to change things very fast even if they did not want to These changes were called The Cultural Revolution Mao and his supporters the Red Guards did not like it if someone talked about his ideas a bad way but many people in Chinese cities did not like Maos ideas because of the food problems There was also no freedom to do many different things when the Red Guards were running the country To keep people from saying bad things about Mao and try to rid of him Mao told all of Chinas best and brightest people quit their jobs and go into the farms China become poorer and weaker because of this

About the same time Mao became the leader in China Nikita Khrushchev became the leader in the Soviet Union Before this Joseph Stalin was the leader in the Soviet Union and Mao liked Stalin and respected his way to lead and China and Russia were allies with each other Khrushchev thought Stalin was a criminal dictator and led the country very differently Mao and Krushchev did not like each other so the Soviet Union was no longer allies with China China now had only a few allies like Albania North Korea Democratic Kampuchea and Pakistan This change of friends was called the Sino Soviet Split Sino is another way to say Chinese in this case

During the 1970s Mao became more friendly with the United States In 1972 American president Richard Nixon visited China and met Mao Mao died in 1976 and the Cultural Revolution ended that year Maos supporters were jailed and Deng Xiaoping who followed Mao changed Maos policies so that Chinese people could have more private ownership

Some Chinese mainlanders still believe Mao Zedong was a great leader but they also knew that he did many unwise and bad things According to Deng Xiaoping Mao was seven parts right and three parts wrong and his contributions are primary and his mistakes secondary Some people think Mao made China lose its important ally or friend the Soviet Union in the Sino Soviet Split The Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution were two of the things that Mao did that many people disliked Most historians people who study history think that about tens of millions of people died because of Maos bad ideas and neglect That is the biggest number of people to ever die without a war Some people disliked Mao because he did not support family planning and this caused too many babies to be born making too many people in too small places Leaders of China after Mao had to make a new rule called one child policy

Mao also made several changes to the Chinese language such as switching from the Wade Giles system of Romanization to Pinyin which is different For this reason Nanking is now called Nanjing on modern maps Taiwan still uses Wade Giles so its capital is called Taipei instead of the pinyin Taibei He also simplified the Chinese characters in theory it would make them easier to read and write so that more people would be literate

Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei or more commonly known as Opus Dei is an organization of the Roman Catholic Church The aim given to Opus Dei by the Catholic Church is to tell everyone that God wants them to be close to him This means that everyone is called by God to become a saint 

Opus Dei was started by St Josemaria Escriva a Roman Catholic priest He started it in 1928 Now Opus Dei has around 85000 members all around the world The head of Opus Dei organization is called a prelate that is why the organization is called a prelature The prelature of Opus Dei has priests and also ordinary lay people 

Opus Dei was approved by the Catholic Church in 1941 And it became a personal prelature in 1982 because of Pope John Paul II 

Opus Dei was started by a Roman Catholic priest Josemaria Escriv on 2 October 1928 in Madrid Spain He said that God himself showed him what to do On that day he saw Opus Dei

He said that the aim of Opus Dei is to help Christians to know that their ordinary life is a way to become a saint and to bring people close to God And to those who truly understand this Opus Dei gives them classes talks and other help so that they can practice this teaching

John Paul II said that Opus Dei was started by Escriva but he was led by God

The present Pope Benedict XVI said in the year 2002 that the name of this organization shows that it is true that Josemaria Escriva did not want to start any organization Escriva just allowed God to do what he wanted And so the organization is not Escrivas work Benedict XVI says It is Opus Dei or Gods work God just used Escriva as a tool to start his own work 

Some people do not accept what the Popes say They say Opus Dei is just the work of a man

The message of St Josemara says Jos Cardinal Saraiva Martins Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints is part of the constant teachings of the Catholic Church Here are the main points of the teachings of Escriv and of Opus Dei on how to get close to God

Escriv said that the basis of the life of a Christian is the fact that we are children of God If we are aware of this fact then we will be very happy always Joy comes from knowing we are children of God 

According to the Catholic Church people can find God in their daily work and activities There they can be very close to him They do not have to become priests or monks to become a saint God wants them to become a saint by doing their ordinary duties and activities well For example studying playing watching TV helping in the house reading a book editing Wikipedia etc The task given to Opus Dei by the Catholic Church is to spread this knowledge that one can be a real saint by doing ordinary things and offering them to God

Pope John Paul II praised Opus Dei and said that its aim of bringing God into the place of work is something great Cardinal Albino Luciani who later became John Paul I said that Escriva brought about a big change in how people deal with God Before people gave importance only to prayers as a way of being close to God Escriva he said gave importance also to work The work one does can become prayer

But when Escriva started teaching this some Jesuits in the 1940s did not understand him They said he was doing something that is against the Catholic faith because at that time it was believed that only priests and nuns can become holy Some Jesuit leaders started saying that Opus Dei has secrets which it does not want the world to know that is why it is dangerous In fact they said Opus Dei just wanted to become very powerful and to control the world 

All these accusations were cleared up by the Popes and Catholic officials These officials say that Opus Dei is doing something good for the world by teaching people how to practice good habits such as telling the truth working hard keeping promises loving people and being concerned with those who are in need 

However since the Jesuits are much respected a lot of people in the world believed what they said Catholics and non Catholics are now attacking Opus Dei around the world They say that the members develop a strong drive to gain influence and that the behaviour resembles that of a sect What is also said about the organisation is that it has a very traditional view of the role of women in a Christian society According to these critics for Opus Dei the duty of the woman is to busy herself about the house and to raise the children of the family

A writer named John L Allen Jr wrote a book in the year 2005 which went against these accusations He said that these claims are mainly based on not understanding Opus Dei He said that Opus Dei only teaches what the Catholic Church teaches He said that there are many Opus Dei women who are very good leaders in business fashion art schools social work etc One half of Opus Dei leaders are women he said and these women also lead men It is also true he says that Opus Dei teaches that women are very good at taking care of their family Escriva said that women are natural teachers 

Another writer Massimo Introvigne said that Opus Dei is now being attacked by people who do not believe in God and people who think that God should not be present in the world of human beings These people he says do not want religion to come back to the lives of many people in society

Prince Metternich of Austria once said that Italy was a geographic expression Basically he called it a place and not a country at all The people of Italy remembered and longed for the glorious days of the Roman Empire One Italian patriot said we need a new Italy a united Italy the Italy of all Italians But after the Congress of Vienna most of Italy had been broken up into small territories under foreign rule Many Italian Nationalists struggled for independence They lost the war terribly

Victor Emmanuel of Piedmont Sardinia saw a great vision of a unified Italy He wanted Piedmont Sardinia to be a model for the unification of Italy To do so he started many public works projects and political reforms Piedmont Sardinia was soon recognized as an emerging power The next step for Piedmont Sardinia s conquest was to get Austria out of the Italian Peninsula With the Crimean War breaking out between France and Britain on one side and Russia on the other Piedmont Sardinia saw a chance to earn some respect and make a name for itself Britain and France proved victorious and Sardinia was able to attend the peace conference As a result of this Piedmont Sardinia gained the support of Napoleon III

Being a police officer can be dangerous Police officers are sometimes killed or hurt by criminals when they are sent to incidents so that is why the police have to carry the equipment needed to defend themselves Police officers have the right to carry weapons such as a gun or a baton in order to stop crime even if the weapon laws are strict and limited to the general public

In different countries police officers are given different equipment to deal with the crime that is in their country All police officers are armed with weapons that they can use to defend themselves or other people that need help Most police officers carry these things

Police officers have to patrol and respond to emergencies as quickly as possible Some police officers will walk on foot patrol but often police officers will patrol in a police car This is so that they can get to emergencies faster and carry more equipment Sometimes officers patrol on bicycles motorbikes or on horses because they have chosen to work in that unit

An account is a record of something that has happened

The word account can be used in a few different ways

The Dutch are the people who live in the Netherlands or those that come from the Netherlands Often the Netherlands is called Holland but this is only part of the Netherlands The Dutch culture and ethnicity are also found outside of the Netherlands with large number of Dutch living in the United States of America South Africa Suriname Namibia

Many inventors were Dutch including Hans Lippershey Hans Janssen and his son Zacharias Janssen the inventors of the microscope and the telescope and the incubator Many famous painters have also been Dutch among them Rembrandt van Rijn Vincent van Gogh and Johannes Vermeer

The definition of the Dutch ethnicity is not always clear One can count all people living the Netherlands as Dutch but this is often not the case This is because many people who live in The Netherlands were not born there There are about 155 million people in the Netherlands who actually have the Dutch nationality So about 1 million people living in the Netherlands who do not even have the Dutch nationality But even more people in the Netherlands were not born there According to some definitions also people who were born in the Netherlands but whos parents were not can not be called Dutch This definition leaves almost 20 of the entire Dutch population to be foreign

Throughout the world there are about 30 million Dutch people

During the last 150 years the Netherlands saw a relative quick population growth as compared to the rest of Europe For comparison The Belgian population grew from 50 more inhabitants in 1850 to a third less in 2000 The population of the Netherlands grew from 3 million in 1850 to 5 million in 1900 to 10 million in 1950 to 16 million in 2000

The Dutch society in the present can be seen as a very multi cultural society About 20 of the entire Dutch population is not of Dutch origin Even most members of the Dutch Royal family are allochtoon This comes from the fact that the Netherlands were open to other nationalities and other religions since the Republic of the Netherlands In the 17th century it was not odd for instance Muslims to live in Amsterdam After the Second World War the Dutch hired many workers from Turkey and Morocco to rebuilt the Netherlands Many of these guest workers stayed in the Netherlands Therefore The Netherlands have a large Turkish and Moroccan community Immigration from especially Suriname and Indonesia also lead to the multi cultural society of the present Recent events have led to negative views on allochtonen by some Dutch people

The Dutch society is also famous for its liberal views The Netherlands were the first country to legalize same sex marriage The Netherlands have a strong gay rights movement Abortion and euthanasia are also legal in the Netherlands The Netherlands are also the only country in the world where marijuana is gedoogd This means it is not legal but the laws against it are not actively enforced 

The Netherlands are one of the busiest countries in the world Almost 165 million people live in the little country Thats why not many Dutch live in villages Most Dutch people live in cities with a city being a place with at least 25000 people living there 87 million Dutch live in agglomerations Thats about 54 of all the Dutch people About 15 of the Dutch people live in citys which are not in an agglomeration The other 30 live in villages

The Netherlands are a country where bicycles are used very much Almost 30 of all travel is done by bicycle in the Netherlands Bicycles are used so much that thoughout the Netherlands hundreds of bicycle paking lots are built In Amsterdam there even is 3 story high bicycle parking lot Train also is used very much The biggest railway company has 11 million travellers per day Thats 7 percent of the entire Dutch population each day

Liquid Paper also called white out and correction fluid is used to correct mistakes made in writing on typewriters and with ink It was originally called Mistake Out and was invented by Bette Nesmith Graham in 1951 who was working at a bank in the US state of Texas at time and had trouble when she typed on the typewriter which was part of her job She made in product in her blender and sold it to friends starting in 1956 She sold the product to the Gillette Corporation for 475 million US Dollars in 1979 When she died the following year her son Michael Nesmith a famous musician formally of The Monkees inherited the fortune

Now people still use the correction fluid but more seldom With more advanced technology people have computers allowing them to backspace easily not needing to use it Also there is also another recent invention of the correction tape To use the fluid you squeeze the bottle and let to fluid flow out to cover the mistakes Usually you have to shake the bottle before using it and after using you need to wait for it to dry for a few minutes which is considered quite fast Then you can write on top of the dried fluid 

Doris Mary Ann von Kappelhoff is an American singer actress and animal welfare activist She is known for her blonde wholesome image

Jack the Ripper is the name given to an unidentified serial killer He was active during the summer and autumn of 1888 in the Whitechapel district of London England which was known for its overpopulation and prostitution 

The main victims thought to be killed by the Ripper were five prostitutes

Newspapers and police in London around this time started to get taunting letters The letters were signed Jack the Ripper Other murders were reported around the same time but were not believed to be the work of Jack the Ripper

Who was Jack the Ripper 

Nobody knows who Jack the Ripper really was Some think he might have been a doctor or a butcher because of how he killed and cut up the women much like how a surgeon might perform surgery or how a butcher might dissect an animal All the murders happened on weekends so it could have been someone who did not live in London but visited the city on weekends or someone who worked during the week and was only free on the weekends

The Ripper was famous for the brutality of his murders He often mutilated his victims usually killing them by slashing their throats open almost to the point of decapitation and stabbing them multiple times especially in the abdomen At about 2300 on 30 August Mary Ann Nichols was seen walking the Whitechapel Road at 0030 she was seen to leave a pub in Brick Lane Spitalfields An hour later she was turned out of 18 Thrawl Street as she was lacking fourpence for a bed implying by her last words that she would soon earn the money on the street with the help of a new bonnet she had acquired She was last seen at the corner of Osborn Street and Whitechapel Road at 0230 an hour before her death by Nelly Holland Nichols claimed she had made enough money to pay for her bed three times over but had drunk it all away it was the last time she was seen alive an hour later she was found lying dead in front of a gated stable entrance in Bucks Row Whitechapel her throat cut and her abdomen ripped open nobody had seen or heard a thing the killer struck again on 8 September Annie chapman was seen talking to a man at about 530 am just beyond the back yard of 29 Hanbury Street Spitalfields Mrs Long described him as over forty and a little taller than Chapman of dark complexion and of foreign shabby genteel appearance He was wearing a deer stalker hat and dark overcoat carpenter Albert Cadosch had entered the neighbouring yard at 27 Hanbury Street seconds later and heard voices in the yard followed by the sound of something falling against the fence Chapmans body was discovered at just before 600 am on the morning of 8 September 1888 by a resident of number 29 market porter John Davis She was lying on the ground near a doorway in the back yard Her throat was cut from left to right and she had been disembowelled with her intestines thrown out of her abdomen over each of her shoulders The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing Chapmans protruding tongue and swollen face led Dr Phillips to think that she may have been asphyxiated with the handkerchief around her neck before her throat was cut

two weeks later a letter was sent claimed to have been written by the killer himself 

The letter received on September 27 1888 was signed Yours Truly Jack the Ripper The law enforcement and newspapers referred to him as the Ripper from that point on The letter read

Dear Boss I keep on hearing the police have caught me but they wont fix me just yet I have laughed when they look so clever and talk about being on the right track That joke about Leather Apron gave me real fits I am down on whores and I shant quit ripping them till I do get buckled Grand work the last job was I gave the lady no time to squeal How can they catch me now I love my work and want to start again You will soon hear of me with my funny little games I saved some of the proper red stuff in a ginger beer bottle over the last job to write with but it went thick like glue and I cant use it Red ink is fit enough I hope ha ha The next job I do I shall clip the ladys ears off and send to the police officers just for jolly wouldnt you Keep this letter back till I do a bit more work then give it out straight My knifes so nice and sharp I want to get to work right away if I get a chance Good Luck

Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes were killed in the early morning of Sunday 30 September 1888 Strides body was discovered at about 1 am in Dutfields Yard off Berner Street in Whitechapel The cause of death was one clear cut incision which severed the main artery on the left side of the neck Uncertainty about whether Strides murder should be attributed to the Ripper or whether he was interrupted during the attack stems from the absence of mutilations to the abdomen Witnesses who said they saw Stride with a man earlier that night gave differing descriptions some said her companion was fair others dark some said he was shabbily dressed others well dressed Eddowes body was found in Mitre Square in the City of London three quarters of an hour after Strides The throat was severed and the abdomen was ripped open by a long deep jagged wound The left kidney and the major part of the uterus had been removed A local man Joseph Lawende had passed through the square with two friends shortly before the murder and he described seeing a fair haired man of shabby appearance with a woman who may have been Eddowes His companions however were unable to confirm his description Eddowes and Strides murders were later called the double event Part of Eddowes bloodied apron was found at the entrance to a tenement in Goulston Street Whitechapel Some writing on the wall above the apron piece which became known as the Goulston Street graffito seemed to implicate a Jew or Jews but it was unclear whether the graffito was written by the murderer as he dropped the apron piece or merely incidentalPolice Commissioner Charles Warren feared the graffito might spark antisemitic riots and ordered it washed away before dawn  The Saucy Jacky postcard was postmarked 1 October 1888 and received the same day by the Central News Agency The handwriting was similar to the Dear Boss letter It mentions that two victims were killed very close to one another double event this time which was thought to refer to the murders of Stride and Eddowes It has been argued that the letter was mailed before the murders were publicised making it unlikely that a crank would have such knowledge of the crime but it was postmarked more than 24 hours after the killings took place long after details were known by journalists and residents of the area

The From Hell letter was received by George Lusk leader of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee on 16 October 1888 The handwriting and style is unlike that of the Dear Boss letter and postcard The letter came with a small box in which Lusk discovered half of a kidney preserved in spirits of wine Eddowes left kidney had been removed by the killer The writer claimed that he fried and ate the missing kidney half There is disagreement over the kidney some contend it belonged to Eddowes while others argue it was nothing more than a macabre practical joke The kidney was examined by Dr Thomas Openshaw of the London Hospital who determined that it was human and from the left side but he could not determine its gender or age Openshaw subsequently also received a letter signed Jack the Ripper

Mary Jane Kelly was seen with a man of Jewish appearance Kelly and the man headed for her room at 13 Millers Court Elizabeth Prater who was woken by her kitten walking over her neck and Sarah Lewis both reported hearing a faint cry of Murder at about 400 am but did not react because they reported that it was common to hear such cries in the East End She claimed not to have slept and to have heard people moving in and out of the court throughout the night She thought she heard someone leaving the residence at about 545 am Kellys gruesomely mutilated body was discovered the next morning lying on the bed at 1045 am on Friday 9 November 1888 The throat had been severed down to the spine and the abdomen virtually emptied of its organs The heart was missing

After the murder of Mary Jane Kelly the Ripper murders stopped suddenly To this day the identity of Jack the Ripper is unknown Although many historians have different opinions and theories on who Jack the Ripper was it will probably never be known who he was

The Dead Sea is a lake lying between the countries of Israel and Jordan At 418 m below sea level it is the lowest point on the surface of the Earth It is almost nine times as salty as the ocean 

The Dead Sea is very salty which makes it impossible for most life to exist in it This is the reason for its name However it is not completely dead as some types of bacteria are able to live in the water 

Because the water is so salty it weighs more than fresh water and a person is able to easily float in the Dead Sea without any effort Tourists come from around the world to float in the water

The American black bear is North Americas smallest and most common species of bear Black bears are omnivores Black bears usually live in forested areas but do leave forests in search of food Sometimes they become attracted to human activity due to a lack of food The American black bear is listed by the IUCN as Least Concern because the species has a large global population estimated to be twice that of all other bear species combined

American black bears usually hibernate during winter During this time the black bears metabolism and heart rate both decrease in relation to one another In fact during hibernation an American black bears heart can stop for twenty seconds The body temperature of black bears also decreases to 31 C during hibernation When hibernation is over the black bears body temperature returns to normal

Jackson Pollock was an American painter He became famous for painting in the abstract expressionist style Pollocks most famous paintings were made by dripping and splashing paint on a large canvas His nickname was Jack the Dripper Because of the method this style is often called action painting Pollock was helped by his wife artist Lee Krasner and his style was very new at the time 

Pollock was bitter and had serious drinking problems He was killed in a car crash at the age of 44 in 1956 His paintings are in museums all over the world and his work is rated very highly Pollock has been the subject of many movies because of his interesting life The most famous was a short documentary film directed by Hans Namuth in 1951 and the movie about his life called Pollock made by and starring actor Ed Harris

Pollock was introduced to the use of liquid paint in 1936 at an experimental workshop operated in New York City by the Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros He later used paint pouring as one of several techniques on canvases of the early 1940s such as Male and Female and Composition with Pouring I After his move to Springs New York he began painting with his canvases laid out on the studio floor and he developed what was later called his drip technique 

Pollock described this use of household paints instead of artists paints as a natural growth out of a need He used hardened brushes sticks and even basting syringes as paint applicators With this technique Pollock was able to achieve a more immediate means of creating art the paint now literally flowing from his chosen tool onto the canvas By defying the convention of painting on an upright surface he added a new dimension literally by being able to view and apply paint to his canvases from all directions 

Later Pollock turned to synthetic resin based paints called alkyd enamels which at that time was a novel medium In 1956 Time magazine called Pollock Jack the Dripper as a result of his unique painting style

Influences on his dripping technique include the Mexican muralists and Surrealist automatism Pollock denied the accident he usually had an idea of how he wanted a particular piece to appear His technique combined the movement of his body over which he had control the viscous flow of paint the force of gravity and the absorption of paint into the canvas It was a mixture of controllable and uncontrollable factors Flinging dripping pouring and spattering he would move energetically around the canvas almost as if in a dance and would not stop until he saw what he wanted to see

The worlds highest price for a work of art is Jackson Pollocks No 5 1948 which was privately sold by Sothebys for 1512 million dollars

Augustus was the first and one of the most important Roman Emperors He led Rome in its transition from a Republic to a great Empire 

Octavian as he was originally called was the adopted son of the dictator of the Roman Republic Gaius Julius Caesar Octavian came into power in the Second Triumvirate This was three men ruling over the Roman Republic The other triumvirs were Mark Antony and Lepidus 

All three were loyal to Julius Caesar the assassinated dictator killed in 44 BC Following his death a civil war broke out across Rome between those loyal to Caesar and the conspirators led by two of Caesars killers Brutus and Cassius

At first Octavian was the junior partner in the triumvirate Lepidus was more experienced in government and Mark Antony was a fine military leader The triumvirate defeated Brutus and Cassius at the Battle of Philippi 42 BC largely due to Antonys leadership Then they split the leadership of the Republic three ways Antony took the east Lepidus took Spain and part of North Africa and Octavian took Italy

Antony followed in Caesars footsteps by going to Egypt and becoming Cleopatras lover They had three children together His absence from Rome allowed the intelligent Octavian to build up support 

The triumvirate broke up in 33 BC and disagreement turned to civil war in 31 BC Antony was defeated by Octavian at the naval Battle of Actium and then at Alexandria He committed suicide as did his lover Cleopatra VII of Egypt in 30 BC

After winning this bloody power struggle Octavian was voted as Emperor by the Senate following the battle of Actium in 31 BC He took the name Augustus He ruled until AD 14 when his stepson and son in law Tiberius became Emperor in his place

During his reign some of those who were against his government were murdered He promised to make Rome a Republic again but instead proclaimed himself High Priest Many temples in the provinces set up statues of him as one of their gods The name of the month August in English comes from him

His main accomplishment was the creation of the Roman Empire a political structure that lasted for nearly five centuries more He first recruited and set up the Praetorian Guard

Historians often use the Res Gestae Divi Augusti as a source about Augustus It was written by him as an inscription for his tomb which recorded all his achievements 

The historian Tacitus is very often used by historians as it gives the an anti Augustan perspective whereas many other sources and histories were written about Augustus very positively An example of writers like these is Velleius Paterculus Virgil Ovid The most fameous work of Augustan propaganda is the Aeneid

Cassius Dio presents a quite impartial account of Augustus as emperor

Camels are mammals of the Camelidae family Camels form the genus Camelus They are also called Afro Asiatic Camelids There are two living species of camels

Camels live in deserts where it is hot and dry Camels have adaptations that help them live in deserts They have a thick coat of hair that protects them from the sun They have wide soft feet so they can walk a long time in the hot sand

Several adaptations help a camel save water When there is food and water a camel can eat and drink large amounts and store it as fat in the hump Then when there is no food or water the camel uses the fat for energy and the hump becomes small and soft A camels waste contains very little water Even the water from the camels breath flows back into its mouth

A camel has a naturally adapted thermostat  it can change its bodily temperature by six degrees Celsius either way It has two sets of eyelashes closing muscles in the nasal passages with slited nostrils hairy ears and tough leathery skin to protect the camels skin in vital emergencies such as a sandstorm It has thick rubbery lips to eat dry prickly plants and a large haired tail to swat pests such as mosquitos and flies

It has a long slender neck in order to reach high leaves such as palm trees and rubbery patches on the belly and knees to protect the skin when kneeling and sitting on the hot sand These form after five years of age

Camels live in groups with one male several females and their young calves 

An unborn camel gestates about 12 to 13 months There is usually one calf per birth A camel calf can run only a few hours after it is born Calves are weaned when they are about 1 3 years old

In the desert people feed camels with grass grains wheat and oats When camels are travelling in the desert food is often very hard to find So the animal might have to live on dried leaves seeds and thorny twigs If there is not any regular food camels will eat anything bones fish meat leather even their owners tent 

Camels are ruminants But a camels stomach has three sections instead of four Camels do not chew their food very well before swallowing The first stomach stores the food that is not completely chewed Later this food returns to the camels mouth and the camel chews it again Then the camel swallows the cud and it goes to the other parts of the stomach to be completely digested

Camels have been domesticated by humans for about 5000 years They are used for riding and to carry things and for meat milk and wool

As domesticated animals they are used in Africa Asia and since the 19th century also in Australia About 900 1000 wild Bactrian Camels still live in China and Mongolia There are no wild Dromedaries anymore but there are escaped domestic Dromedaries in Australia Today there are about 50000 Dromedaries living wild in the Outback in Australia

A Dromedary and a Bactrian Camel can have hybrid children that are called Tulus or Bukhts These hybrids are larger than the Dromedary or Bactrian Camel and have either one long hump or one small and one big hump

When a camel calf reaches one year of age the owner often teaches it to stand and kneel on command They also learn to carry small light packs around As they grow older the size of the pack also increases

Antibiotics are medicine that kills bacteria or slows the growth of bacteria They are used to cure diseases Antibiotics do not harm people Penicillin is a popular antibiotic Antibiotics started to be produced in 1939 Antibiotics can not stop a virus Antibiotics are not the same thing as antibodies

Today people fear that bacteria will not be affected by antibiotics because bacteria might become too strong This can happen when antibiotics are used too much If they are used a lot some bacteria may get used to them and not be harmed by them This is called resistance These bacteria could then multiply and make a large colony which would not be affected by antibiotics

Antibiotics must be used under supervision of a certified medical practitioner because the dose and frequency is different for treating various microbes They also can detect some side effects and give you treatment modification

Antibiotics are chemicals that kill or slow bacteria growth without harming body cells

Sexism is discrimination based on the gender of a person  looking down on people because they are male or female Sexism may also include stereotyped roles for men and women International laws such as Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women or Yogyakarta Principles demand to abolish any kind of sexism And it might affect the male or female attending a party getting a job that means being hired joining a game promotion being selected and so on 

Go is a board game called I Go in Japanese and Wei chi in Chinese It is played on a board with pieces of two colors called stones Players take turns placing a stone of their color on intersections of the 19x19 square grid A normal Go board has 19 rows and columns of lines Sometimes Go is played on smaller 9x9 or 13x13 boards instead of 19x19 

Stones do not move after they are placed but stones with no liberties are captured and removed from the board The goal of this game is to have more points when the game ends by placing pieces around the board to surround areas At the end of each game each players space prisoners or stones and komi are counted to see who has more points 

This game was invented in China but the specific time is not known The historian of board games HJR Murray said

Its original Chinese name is It is also popular in Japan and its common name Go comes from Japanese In Korea the game is called baduk In these three countries the game is an important part of the culture like chess is in many western countries

Go and chess are both board games and strategy games though both may be used as gambling games as well They share a tenuous connection to the art of war though this is most obvious in chess which was a war game in origin They both have no luck or secret information unlike some other classic games like backgammon or poker and other card games which also have secret information

There are many places to play Go on the internet as well as local clubs and national organizations in many countries around the world

A donkey or ass is a mammal of the Equidae family It is a domesticated animal that people use for transportation and other work such as pulling a carriage or plowing a field

Donkeys can have hybrid children with a horse The child of a female horse and a male donkey is called a mule The child of a female donkey and a male horse is called a hinny Mules are more common and have been used for transportation of people and things

Donkeys zebras and mules all look different from horses The biggest difference is the ears Donkeys ears are much longer than a horses The necks are straighter and the croup and rump are also a different shape The back is straighter

The mane and tail of the donkey are rough The mane is still and upright almost always standing up and the tail is more like a cows most of it covered with short body hair Because their mane sometimes fly away many donkeys wear their manes clipped short or shaved close to the neck

Hoof shapes are different as well donkey hooves are smaller and rounder with more upright pasterns The legs should have good bone but lots of donkeys have long thin legs with tiny feet Larger donkeys may appear opposite with big heavy legs and large round feet Good legs and feet are very important for mules that are trying to find a mate This is because a good foot is more liked than a large body on small legs and feet

The donkeys voice is a very raspy kind and it makes the Aw ee aw ee noise Although most people think donkeys are a gray color sometimes they can have stripes dark ear marks as well as the Light Points This means that it has a white muzzle and white rings around its eyes and a white belly and inner leg

Colors of the donkey may be from gray to brown Or sometimes they can be black both red and gray creamy white or a unique Spotted pattern Donkeys come in lots of different sizes Some like the rare French donkey has huge heads and ears and very thick shaggy curled black coat

Good grass hay and pasture is usually what donkeys enjoy to eat If the hay or grass is grained the protein is best to be lower than 12 However if a donkey is overfed it will have a roll on the neck A roll is when fat bunches up and stays in a part of a donkeys body and they usually happen on its neck or its hip If they develop on the donkey it will usually stay for its whole life If the neck roll of fat gets too heavy it will fall or break over to one side and never recover its balance again This is why donkeys should not be fed too much Most people do not like to work with donkeys They think that donkeys are too stubborn and will kick them However a donkey that is nicely trained can be as easy managed as many other horses

The Persian alphabet used in Iran and Afghanistan is very similar to the Arabic one but the language is in a different family than Arabic so their vocabulary and grammar are very different Since the 1930s in the countries which used to be in the Soviet Union like Tajikistan and Uzbekistan Persian has been written in an alphabet that is similar to the Russian one In the past all Persian speakers used the one based on Arabic

The Republic of Zambia is a country in southern Africa It shares its borders with the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north Tanzania to the north east Malawi to the east Mozambique Zimbabwe Botswana and Namibia to the south and Angola to the west It was called Northern Rhodesia and it is currently named after the Zambezi River

The capital of Zambia is Lusaka which is also the largest city in the country Its current president is Rupiah Banda and has been independent since 24 October 1964 Its motto is One Zambia One Nation and its national anthem is Stand and Sing of Zambia Proud and Free Its official language is English

Zambia originated from Northern Rhodesia which was a colony of Great Britain In 1965 Zambia became an independent country The first president was Kenneth Kaunda who ruled Zambia for 30 years with his party UNIP Zambia was a one party democracy UNIP was the only legal party and all other parties were banned 

After protests democratic elections were held in 1991 Kenneth Kaunda lost the elections and gave away his power in a orderly manner to his successor Frederick Chiluba a former union leader 

Zambia is now a multi party democracy It has had three democratic elections since 1991 The latest presidential election was in 2008 which was won by Rupiah Banda against Michael Sata

In the 1960s Zambia was making a lot of money because of the copper deposits that were mined in Copperbelt province When copper became cheaper in the 1970s the economy got worse because people in Zambia were not making as much money from selling copper 

Today Zambia is a poor country It does not have many industries Copper is still its main export Commercial farming in Zambia is starting to make more money

The country was occupied by the United States from 1916 to 1924 The Dominican Republic is a presidential democratic republic The country has a tropical climate but modified by elevation and the trade winds

The Hispaniola was discovered by Christopher Columbus on 5 December 1492 but the first time that he saw part of the present Dominican Republic was on 4 January 1493 when he saw a headland that he named Monte Cristi That mountain is called now El Morro and is near the city of Monte Cristi

From Monte Cristi Columbus went east along the north coast of the island and on 16 January after visiting the Saman Bay he went back to Spain In his second trip to America he founded the first European city in the continent La Isabela near the present city of Puerto Plata

Later Bartholomew Columbus founded the city of Santo Domingo the oldest permanent European city in the Americas From here many Spaniards went to conquer other islands because Cuba was closer to the continent many people move from Hispaniola to that island and then to the continent Because of that the population of the island grew very slowly By the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697 Spain gave the western third of the island to France and kept the eastern part and so the island had two different colonies the French Saint Domingue and the Spanish Santo Domingo In 1795 France got the whole island but they could only control the eastern part because Haiti became independent very soon In 1809 the French government gave back the old colony of Santo Domingo to Spain

On 1 December 1821 the Spanish lieutenant governor Jos Nez de Cceres declared the independence from Spain The new country had the name Estado Independiente del Hait Espaol But on 9 February 1822 the Haitian army occupied the country and stayed for 22 years Juan Pablo Duarte founded a secret society La Trinitaria to fight for the Dominican independence The Haitian occupation ended on 27 February 1844 when the inhabitants of the eastern part of the Hispaniola made a new country named Repblica Dominicana From 1861 to 1865 the country was again a Spanish colony On 16 August 1863 began the Restoration War when the Dominicans fought to be free again That war ended in 1865 when the Spanish left and the Dominican Republic was again an independent country

The country was occupied by the United States from 1916 to 1924 In 1930 Rafael Trujillo became the president of the country through a coup dtat Trujillo was a cruel dictator killing thousands of persons among them many Haitians Trujillo was killed in 1961 After the death of Trujillo Juan Bosch was elected in 1962 and became in 1963 the first elected president since 1930 But was Bosch was in power during only seven months In 1965 there was a civil war between those that wanted Bosch back on power and those that were opposed to him Then the country was invaded again by the United States

Since the end of the civil war the presidents of the Dominican Republic have been

The Dominican Republic is a presidential democratic republicThe government is divided in three branches the Executive the Legislative and the Judiciary The Executive branch is made up of the President the Vice President and the Ministers who are called Secretaries of State The President is chief of state and head of government and is elected every 4 years He nominates the cabinet The current president is Leonel Fernndez

There are other smaller valleys in the mountains Constanza Jarabacoa Bonao Villa Altagracia

The four most important rivers of the Dominican Republic are Yaque del Norte Yuna Yaque del Sur and Ozama There are many lakes the largest is the Lake Enriquillo located in the Hoya de Enriquillo

The country has a tropical climate but modified by elevation and the trade winds At sea level the average temperature is 25 C with small changes from one season to another In the highest mountains the temperature in winter can be as low as 0 C

There are two wet seasons April June and September November The most dry period is from December to March Rainfall varies greatly eastern regions like the Saman Peninsula get an average of over 2000 mm in a year but less than 500 mm fall in the southwest

From June to November hurricanes are frequent and can do much damage in the island

The Dominican Republic has a mixed economy based mainly on agriculture services trade and money sent from the many Dominicans that live in other countries Agricultural production was the main economic activity but now is in third place after tourism and manufacturing in zonas francas

Mining is also important mainly ferronickel and gold

The Dominican Republic suffers from poverty with 633 of the population living below the poverty line in 2004 The wealth distribution is uneven the richest 10 gets nearly 40 of national income

The culture of the Dominican Republic like in other Caribbean countries is a mix of Tano African and European cultures

There are not many Tano traditions in the modern Dominican culture many places keep their Tano names Dajabn Bnica Haina Yaque Saman etc Also many objects plants and animals have a Tano origin and their names have been included in other languages for example canoa hamaca maz yuca and batata

That mix of different traditions created a culture that is known as Creole common to all countries in the Caribbean Louisiana and some parts of South America and Central America

In the Dominican Republic only Spanish is spoken even though Haitian Creole is gaining importance because the massive immigration from Haiti

The official religion is Roman Catholicism but there is freedom of religion Protestant groups are important representing about 15 of the total population Each year major festivities called fiestas patronales are held They are Catholic festivities in honor of the Patron saints of the towns and villages it is a Spanish tradition to associate every town with a Catholic saint The festivities includes church services street parades fire works dance contests and other activities

African influences have the strongest influences in Dominican culture especially in language religion food and music

Notes

Navassa Island or La Navase in Haitian Creole is a small island without anyone living on it in the Caribbean Sea It is located ninety miles south of Guantanamo Bay Cuba The United States government claims the two square mile island as a territory of the United States and it is under control of the US Fish and Wildlife Service The island is also wanted by Haiti

Some sailors sailing with Christopher Columbus named Navassa in 1504 because no fresh water could be found there

A captain named Peter Duncan gave it to the US in the late 1850s for the purpose of guano mining After a rebellion in 1889 and the Spanish American War of 1898 the mining was put to an end

With the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 Navassa became important again because of a lighthouse being built there After World War II no one lived on it again

In 1996 Navassas light was put out of use and the island was transferred to the US Department of the Interior Three years later the Fish and Wildlife Service received ownership of the island

Navassa became a US insular area in October 1857 when a representative of the Baltimore Fertilizer Company took possession of the island in the name of the United States pursuant to the Guano Act of August 18 1856 In 1889 the islands actual operation passed to the Navassa Phosphate Company All operations were abandoned in 1898 when the island became effectively uninhabited

Navassa Island is three square miles in area Navassa lies about one hundred miles south of Guantanamo Bay Cuba about thirty miles west of Cape Tiburon Haiti at the southwest entrance to the Windward Passage east of Kingston Jamaica Navassas climate is marine and tropical

Its terrain is a raised coral and limestone plateau flat to undulating ringed by vertical white cliffs approximately nine to fifteen yards high Navassas environment is mostly exposed rock However it has enough grassland to support goat herds Dense stands of fig like trees and scattered cactus also exist Only one tenth of the islands land is meadows or pastures Navassa has no ports and only off shore anchorage

In 1976 the US Coast Guard determined that the lighthouse on Navassa was no longer of any value to the US Government and was ceasing its exercise of any interest in the island However the US Coast Guards ceasing to administer Navassas use did not have any bearing at all on the United States sovereignty over the island which remained constant regardless of the administering Federal agency or office Consequently under the provisions of Title 43 USCode section 1458 the Department of the Interior assumed responsibility for the civil administration of the US insular area

Acting under the authority that the Secretary of the Interior delegated to him in Secretarys Order No 3205 and Amendment No 1 to Secretarys Order No 3205 and in fulfillment of his responsibilities as the civil administrator of the United States insular area of Navassa Island the Director of the Office of Insular Affairs advises all persons interested in visiting Navassa Island that having made a preliminary review of the islands ecology he has decided indefinitely not to allow visits to the island and its surrounding waters until he has received a further assessment of the islands environment and conservation status As used in this notice the term surrounding waters includes the waters surrounding Navassa Island seaward to a line twelve nautical miles distant from Navassa Islands coastlines The Director of the Office of Insular Affairs intends that nothing in this notice shall deny or impair the right of innocent passage in the waters surrounding Navassa Island

On September 2 1999 the US Fish and Wildlife Service established the Navassa Island Wildlife Refuge as an overlay As of December 3 1999 the Office of Insular Affairs ceased to have any administrative responsibility for Navassa A Secretarys order of that date transferred full administration of Navassa from the Office of Insular Affairs to the US Fish and Wildlife Service

Television Movie

Current Series 26 March 2005 now

Doctor Who is a science fiction television series The series is about an alien time traveller known as the Doctor In his space and time ship the TARDIS the Doctor and his companions travel through space and time

The television series ran from 19631989 and started running again in 2005 It is the oldest and the longest running science fiction television series in the world

There were also two Doctor Who movies made in the 1960s Peter Cushing played the Doctor in these movies In 1996 there was a television movie starring Paul McGann There have also been many Doctor Who books comics etc 

The story is about a man who calls himself The Doctor He travels in his space time ship TARDIS with which he can go anywhere in time and space Because of an error in its chameleon circuit the outside of the TARDIS always looks like a 1960s style British police box but on the inside the TARDIS is much bigger 

The Doctor is an alien a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey At first he traveled only with his granddaughter Susan Foreman Later the Doctor took other people with him who are usually called companions or assistants The Doctor and his companions travel through space and time have a lot of adventures and often save many people 

An often made mistake is the name of the Doctor Many people think that the main character is named Doctor Who like the series but the character is just named The Doctor

Doctor Who was first shown in 1963 The actor William Hartnell played the First Doctor The series went on with different actors as The Doctor In 1989 the series stopped A television movie also called Doctor Who was made in 1996 Actor Paul McGann played the Eighth Doctor who had regenerated from the Seventh Doctor in the beginning of the movie In 2005 the show started again with Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor In the Guinness World Records Doctor Who is listed as the longest running science fiction television series in the world

The Doctor is the central character of Doctor Who He is an alien a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey The Doctor often takes other people with him who are usually called companions or assistants They are most often human the most recent companion was Amy Pond 

As a Gallifreyan The Doctor looks like a human on the surface but there are differences One well known difference is that he has two hearts As a Time Lord The Doctor can also regenerate if his body is badly hurt and he dies During the regeneration the body is healed and renewed which includes a different appearance and personality The regenerated person is the same person with the same memories and basic personality traits but the person also looks different and a changed personality Because of this the Doctor could be played by different actors This made it possible for the series to be filmed over a time of forty years without having to actually change the character Very lately Alex Urch went to receive an award after winning a drawing competition on the doctor who fan site

Up until now the Doctor has regenerated ten times and each incarnation was played by a different actor

The Doctor has been played by other actors in other media theatre plays parodies etc These are not officially part of the Doctor Who story The films DrWho the Daleks and Daleks Invasion Earth 2150 AD star Peter Cushing as a human scientist named Doctor Who Shortly after it was announced that the series would return from its nineties hiatus Richard E Grant voiced The Doctor in an animated serial The BBC issued press releases identifying Grant as the ninth Doctor but this was later disregarded by the revived BBC television series

The TARDIS is the Doctors time and space machine There are different types of models the best seen in the series is type 70 The Doctors TARDIS is in fact a type 40 It can travel through time and space It normally has a special feature called the Chameleon Circuit The Chameleon Circuit makes the TARDIS outside change shape so that it is disguised in whatever time and place it appears The Chameleon Circuit on the Doctors TARDIS is broken It is stuck in the shape of a police telephone box 

The farthest the Doctor has ever travelled in the TARDIS is to the Big Bang and 100 trillion years into the future The inside of the TARDIS is much bigger than its outside It has a lot of different rooms but the most important is the console room where the Doctor pilots the TARDIS

The TARDIS stands for Time And Relative Dimensions In Space

The Doctor usually takes other people with him who are usually called companions or assistants The Doctor and his companions travel through space and time have a lot of adventures and often save many people The character of the companion was there so that the people watching the series could identify and feel close to a character The companions were often present time humans so people could feel close to them and they knew as much as the viewers Because of this the Doctor could explain things to his companions and at the same time to the viewers Almost all the Doctors companions have been human or human looking aliens Two companions were robots

The Daleks are one of the most powerful races in the Doctor Who history and are the Doctors worst enemies They cry EX TER MIN ATE when they are about to kill someone They look like small tanks or very large pepper pots They first appeared in the first season episode of the series and they were last seen in the recent episode The Big Bang They are not robots but horrible aliens kept in a metal casing because they were mutated from Kaleds by their creator Davros during a war on their planet Skaro They can not be easily hurt by guns as their casing reflects or destroys the bullets

Cybermen are another of the enemies of the Doctor In the original series they come from the planet Mondas and in the new series they come from a parallel universe Cybermen travel across the universe taking people and turning them into machines They stomp around saying DELETE and kill by electrocution They change their look over time but stay recognizable by handlebars on their heads

The Doctor has faced them many times the first was in The Tenth Planet and most recently in The Big Bang They are one of his worst enemies

The Sontarans are a group of aliens that believe in war over anything else They must face their enemy in combat because of their weak spot on the back of their neck They have been mentioned to look like baked potatoes

The Doctor first met them in The Time Warrior They have been on the show and its spinoffs repeatedly

The Sea Devils and the Silurians lived in the time of the dinosaurs until the catastrophe of the Moons approach drove them into hibernation They slept longer than planned and emerged late in the 20th century The human scientist who discovered the Silurians estimated their era incorrectly in a later Doctor Who story its said that they should have been classified as the Eocines A second species of hibernating Earth reptiles lived primarily underwater They were labeled sea devils by a frightened superstitious construction worker who encountered them

The Time Lords are the alien race the Doctor comes from They have two hearts and can change their bodies when they get hurt There are only a couple of them left because many of them perished in the time war fighting against the Daleks The Doctor and The Master are the only ones that we know of aside from the Doctors Daughter who was created artificially so is not truly a Time Lord

All of the Time Lords except the Doctor and the Master were killed in the Time War a very big war with the Daleks The Doctor ended the war by blowing up his planet Gallifrey killing the Daleks and his own people It has made him sad ever since

The Master is a renegade Time Lord and the Doctors nemesis Conceived as Professor Moriarty to the Doctors Sherlock Holmes the character first appeared in 1971 As with the Doctor the role has been portrayed by several actors the first being Roger Delgado who continued in the role until his death in 1973 The Master was briefly played by Peter Pratt and Geoffrey Beevers until Anthony Ainley took over and continued to play the character until Doctor Whos hiatus in 1989 The Master returned in the 1996 television movie of Doctor Who played by Gordon Tipple in the ultimately unused pre credits voiceover then Eric Roberts and in the three part finale of the 2007 series portrayed by Derek Jacobi who then regenerated into John Simm at the conclusion of the episode Utopia More recently he appeared in the last episode of the Tenth Doctor

The Doctor has been played by eleven actors so far including William Hartnell Patrick Troughton John Pertwee Tom Baker Peter Davison Colin Baker Sylvester McCoy Paul McGan Christopher Eccleston David Tennant and Matt Smith  

In the story when Time Lords are dying they regenerate This causes a Time Lords body to completely change healing itself at the same time Each time this happens Time Lords have a different appearance and a different personality Even with such big changes Time Lords do not become different people and will keep their memories each time they regenerate This periodic change greatly extends their longevity

A Time Lord is believed to only be able to regenerate 12 times This means that Time Lords can have a total of 13 different incarnations It is not clear if this was a law that the government on Gallifrey made or if this is just the way Time Lord bodies work

A criminal incarnation of the Doctor was somehow spawned between his 12th and 13th lives It tried to sacrifice the sixth Doctor so that he could obtain more regenerations allowing himself to live even longer

The Master was already in his 13th life when he was introduced to the series His 14th and 15th incarnations were obtained by taking over the bodies of innocent victims When the character returned to the show in 2007 the Master was in his 16th incarnation Soon he regenerates into his 17th incarnation He later explains that the Time Lords resurrected him to be a great soldier when the Time Lords were fighting the Daleks in an event known as the Time War It is likely that having been resurrected he had 12 more regenerations available to him

A Time Lord can choose not to regenerate It appears that the process happens all on its own when a Time Lord is dying but it can be stopped if the Time Lord does not want to regenerate This was seen when the 17th incarnation of the Master chose to die from a gunshot wound instead of living on as a prisoner in the Doctors TARDIS

A Time Lords body makes a huge amount of energy when regenerating There is so much of this regeneration energy that a Time Lord can regrow a body part that gets removed as long as it happens soon enough after regenerating When the Doctor regenerated into his 10th incarnation his hand was cut off in a sword fight Because it had been less than 15 hours since he had regenerated into this incarnation he was able to quickly grow a new hand

If a Time Lord has kept a part of his or her body that had been removed it can be used to keep a Time Lord from regenerating The 10th incarnation of the Doctor kept the hand that was cut off in the sword fight in a jar on board the TARDIS Eventually he was shot by a Dalek and his body began the regeneration process After his body had finished healing but before his body could change into a new one the Doctor sent all of the extra energy into the hand in the jar

A concentration camp is a place which a government uses to keep people who are either against that government or who it thinks are too dangerous to remain free Sometimes these are called internment camps where a large number of people are put in prison without a trial

The people who are locked away in such a prison are not usually yet found guilty of a crime but may be politically against the leaders of a region people who are of a certain race or religion or non military prisoners of war

Many countries have used concentration camps often during wars or times of trouble and fighting

The first concentration camps were used by the British in the Second Boer War in Africa around 1900 The families of South African men fighting against the British were put in camps to stop them from giving food and help to the fighters Their houses and farms were burned At least 30000 people mostly children died in these camps from sickness or hunger

Concentration camps became more famous and hated after 1936 when Nazi Germanys leader Adolf Hitler thought certain groups of people should be killed and others were politically dangerous People were often sent to these camps to work After a few years some camps were set up to kill people These are now called extermination camps or death camps People were gassed shot or sometimes worked to death Some of these people were given a trial but these trials were very unfair

The Nazi gas chambers reportedly killed up to 20000 people a day towards the end of World War II Over half of the people who died in the Holocaust died at such concentration camps at least 11 million people at the camps of Auschwitz alone

In Italy or on its occupied territories were also concentration camps which were established by Benito Mussolini In these concentration camps were imprisoned especially Croats Slovenes and Jews 

Prison camps had been in use in Russia for many years especially in places in the Arctic or Siberia a long way from any cities From the 1920s under the Soviet Union many more people were sent to such camps and they were very badly treated there One might still die there but would most likely be used to work first That is called a labour camp These camps are sometimes called gulags the Russian name for them Anyone who was seen as a threat to the government was sent there In 1939 there were about 1300000 people working as slaves in these camps The Russian writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn wrote a book called The Gulag Archipelago by which many people realized what crimes the communist Soviet Union government had done

In the United States during the American Civil War in the 1860s soldiers who been captured were sometimes all crowded together in bad conditions These were meant to be prisoner of war camps with good conditions but many men died from sickness or hunger At Andersonville prison about 12000 men died This camp was not meant to be so bad and the man in charge was later tried and killed for war crimes

During the so called Indian Wars the United States made many enemies who were Native Americans These people were forced to leave their land and were often put into camps where they could not leave In some cases many people especially children died from hunger and sickness These camps were called reservations in that some land had been set aside or reserved for the Native Americans Again these camps were not meant to be so bad but many things went wrong

During World War II the United States placed many Japanese Americans in internment camps

A Ribosome is a part of a cell that creates protein 

A ribosome is a mixture of protein and RNA that starts its formation in the nucleolus of a cell The nucleolus is found in the center of the nucleus The nucleus is protected by the nuclear envelope and lets things out through the nuclear pores 

The job of the ribosome is to make new proteins It does this by moving along a strand of RNA and building a protein based on the code it reads Making a protein this way is called translation Ribosomes are usually found in the rough endoplasmic reticulum but can also be found throughout the cytoplasm

In the late 1930s Hitler began attacking many countries and taking over them Later on September 1st 1939 he attacked Poland With over a million troops he easily took over Poland while losing just around 59000 soldiers Poland lost over 900000

Hitler continued on and took over France in the Battle of France Afterwards on October 12 1939 Hitler sent a letter to the United Kingdom demanding they surrender and that if they do surrender the Germans wont do anything bad to them However Winston Churchill the Prime Minister at the time refused and the Battle of Britain began

The Battle of Britain lasted throughout July to October 1940 The battle resulted in heavy losses for the Luftwaffe and in early October they retreated back into Greater Germany Hitler was unhappy and furious with the failure of the Battle and demanded that Britain be taken over one way or another 

In 1941 Hitler gave orders to attack the Soviet Union The attack was codenamed Operation Barbarossa and lasted from June 22 to December 5 1941 until Hitlers soldiers couldnt last longer there Russia was a freezing cold place and many soldiers got sick from the cold weather Hitler lost 250000 men over 2000 aircraft and over 2500 tanks lost Hitler although a good politician had not thought this plan through and ended up losing over 20 of his army of 39 million 

After that the United States Britain France and the Soviet Union teamed up and fought Hitlers army In May 1945 the war was over and Hitler killed himself Nazi Germany was taken over by the four allied nations

A US state is one of the states of the United States of America Four states use the term commonwealth because they called themselves that when the United States was first formed but this is only tradition and they are still states

Tomato is a red fruit It is shiny and smooth and has many small seeds The tomato is green when it is unripe It slowly changes color from green to red as it gets more ripe There are many different types of tomatoes Most tomatoes are red but some special kinds are yellow or orange when they are ripe Also some tomatoes are as small as strawberries and some will become as big as apples Tomatoes are used a lot in Italian food They are also used to make ketchup Sometimes people mistake it for a vegetable

Pineapple is a plant and a fruit It is from Brazil Bolivia and Paraguay but is grown as a crop in other tropical areas most famously in Hawaii The plant is a short with 30 or more trough shaped pointed leaves surrounding a thick stem The fruit is is slightly acidic and very tasty some people like it on pizza or on ice cream

Pear is a fruit that resembles a teardrop Ripe pears have a flavor that is best when it is cool They are juicy Pears do not ripen well on trees They can be soft in the center It is harvested when it is fully ready to be picked They can be baked canned or frozen They can be made into jams jellies or juice They can also be made into pies and put into salads or baby food Pear trees grow on heavy soil It is eighty three percent water It has a green or red skin The pear came from Europe Africa and Asia

Pears are in the subfamily Maloideae with apples It is a subfamily of the family Rosaceae 

A melon is a word used for a number of members of fruit in the Cucurbitaceae family

The origin of the melon as we know it today is rather shrouded in mystery Of a surety they originated in Asia and Africa rather than in the US and brought to England around the sixteenth century AD Melons were first introduced to the New World by Columbus during his second expedition They were part of rations aboard the ships to help prevent scurvy in sailors Once his men had eaten them and discarded the seeds the crop quickly took hold in Haiti and spread from there Seeds were also brought to California by Spanish Conquistadors Navajos were farming the fruit by the 1800s from seeds brought from Latin America However melons did not gain prominence as a common food until it was brought again during the slave trade 

The melon belongs to the Kingdom Plantae and is classified as a fruit though in cooking it is used as both a fruit and a vegetable Its genus and species are both Cucunis Within these groups they are also distinguished by their Latin names into two groups Cucumis and Citrullus Aside from these classifications they are also separated into many varieties Exactly how many varieties is unknown Some biblical accounts say that there are thousands and others far fewer The three most common are the watermelon cantaloupe and honeydew The cantaloupe also called a muskmelon belongs to the Cucumis family It has beige netted skin and sweet orange flesh that is high in beta carotene Watermelons have green striped skin that free of netting and a moist red interior sprinkled with black and white seeds

Other types lean toward the exotic such as the Crenshaw A hybrid between the casaba and the Persian melon Crenshaws have a distinct spicy flavor Still stranger is the melon known as Santa Claus It is known as such because it matures in December in Brazil and Costa Rica The vine on which it grows is eight to ten feet in length The flesh is crisp and varies in color from yellow to green to white

Melons are a highly nutritious food It has been touted for centuries that they have numerous medicinal properties The seeds of cantaloupe were used in China to moderate fevers and the digestive system Elsewhere seeds were pulverized and used to treat tuberculosis Cantaloupes are particularly beneficial to people with heart disease as they contain large of amounts of an anticoagulant known as adenosine They also contain high levels of potassium which benefits those with high blood pressure Due to their high water content all melons are considered diuretics 

There is also evidence that suggests that consumption of melons can lower the risk of cancer USDA researches have discovers that melons contain lycopene an antioxidant found in a select group of fruits and vegetables Lycopene treats and prevents cancer by trapping free radicals in cells

Member of the gourd and pumpkin family melons are notoriously promiscuous meaning that they must be kept separate from other melons due to the fact that they readily pollinate each other They are not particularly hardy nor are they very frail They require about four months of warm weather and like lots of direct sunlight Unlike some vegetables indoor germination with plans to transplant outside does not work well Melons simply will not grow well that way For best results seeding them outdoors in early may works very well Since they are a vine fruit they require lots of space to spread out some dwarf or midget varieties can do well in planters such as large truck tires No matter how you plant them melons must be kept warm If the temperatures drop below fifty regularly the result will be small bitter fruit Two other requirements are fertile soil and lots of water Good dirt is imperative to grow melons These fruits also require copious amounts of water However as fruits grow nearer to harvest it is recommended to cease watering for one week prior to picking This will allow the sugars to develop

A raspberry is an aggreate fruit meaning it is many fruits joined together

It typically grows in forest clearings or fields where fire or wood cutting has produced open space The raspberry flower can be a source of nectar for honeybees As a cultivated plant in moist temperate regions it is easy to grow It has a tendency to spread unless cut back

Two types of raspberries can be bought in stores the wild summer bearing type which produces fruit in the summer and double or ever bearing plants which also bear fruit in the summerclarify

Leaves of the raspberry are used fresh or dried in herbal teas Leaves are found in groups of 3 or 5 and the undersides are silver white in color Blackberries have leaves that look similar to raspberry leaves but the undersides are green

A plum is a sweet fruit Its scientific name is Prunus When dried it is called a prune The color plum takes its name from the fruit Plum colored plums are called purple plums and are a deep purple color other plums are reddish purple Some other plums can be yellow red green or even white The fruit has a groove running down one side and a smooth stone The flesh of the fruit is brownish and is very juicy The skin can be eaten It can also be used to make jam and the juice can be used to make wine It is closely related to the apricot 

The Peach is a species of the Prunus persica and is a fruit tree of the rose family Rosaceae They grow in the warm regions of both the Northern and Southern hemispheres

Peaches are grown all over the world these days but they are becoming very expensive In Peru peaches are called panigwats which means sweet fruit

The Peach blossoms are from small to medium sized The tree is sometimes up to 65 m in height When it is grown by people though the height it is usually kept between 3 and 4 m by pruning Its leaves are green and pointy They usually have glands that make a liquid to attract insects

Peaches are also called stone fruits because they have a shell of hard wood around their seed called a stone or a pit The skin of a peach is an orange or yellow color and it is covered in small hairs called a peach fuzz A peach without the fuzz is usually called a nectarine The inside of a peach is a golden color It tastes sweet and sticky Because of this peaches are often part of dessert 

Peach first came from China It has been grown from at least since 1000 BCE In Chinese culture the peach tree is considered to be the tree of life and peaches are symbols of immortality Peach blossoms are carried by Chinese brides

Because of the cold winter diseases and pests peach trees can usually only live about 10 to 12 years However if a peach tree is fertilized properly and taken care of in the right way it may live more years

Brown rot is a very dangerous kind of peach disease It can attack the blossoms and stop the fruit from developing If it is not stopped quickly good quality fruit can not be produced from the peach tree

Peach leaf curl which is another very serious disease makes the leaves curl up and begin to die in Spring It can be stopped if it meets fungicide

Bacterial spot gives harm to the leaves twigs and fruit By the time the disease is recognized it is often too late to stop it However some kind of sprays may be used early in the next season to protect the peach tree

Cankers is a kind of disease that infects the twigs and branches They make large amounts of amber colored gum spill out from the infected branch Later the bark will crack open completely and the tissue of the twig turns black Cankers can be removed by pruning

There are several kinds of insect pests that can be great trouble to the peach The Oriental Fruit Moth can make the peaches filled with worms and young growing tips may die The Plum Curculio lays its eggs on the fruit and makes them drop off or become filled with worms Insects like the Tarnished Plant Bug and the Stink Bug eat up the fruit that is still developing Borers attack the base of the trunk and the branches

Fig is a soft sweet fruit Its skin is very thin and has many small seeds inside of it There are more than 850 species of Ficus the fig tree 

The fruits can be eaten when ripe and when dried Figs grow in warm climates Sometimes figs are made into jam Figs are also in a popular snack

Figs are pollinated by fig wasps

The fig fruit is called a synconium Many figs are grown for their fruit though only Ficus carica the Common Fig is cultivated to any extent for human consumption 

The fig is a false fruit or multiple fruit in which the flowers and seeds grow together to form a single mass Depending on the species each fruit can contain up to several hundred to several thousand seeds

A fig fruit is derived from a specially adapted type of inflorescence In this case it is a turned inwards nearly closed receptacle with many small flowers arranged on the inner surface 

Thus the actual flowers of the fig are unseen unless the fig is cut open It is a fruit without a visible flower 

The fig fruits important as both food and traditional medicine contain laxative substances flavonoids sugars vitamins A and C acids and enzymes However figs are skin allergens and the sap is a serious eye irritant 

Some parthenocarpic cultivars of Common Figs do not require pollination at all and will produce a crop of seedless edible figs without caprifigs or fig wasps

The syconium often has a bulbous shape with a small opening at the outward end used by pollinators The flowers are pollinated by very small wasps which crawl through the opening in search of a suitable place to lay eggs 

Without this fig trees cannot reproduce by seed In turn the flowers provide a safe haven and nourishment for the next generation of wasps This has led to a co evolutionary relationship 

Fig plants can be monoecious or gynodioecious Nearly half of fig species are gynodioecious and have plants with inflorescences with long styled pistillate flowers or have plants with staminate flowers mixed with short styled pistillate flowers The long flower styles tend to prevent wasps from laying their eggs within the ovules while the short styled flowers are accessible for egg laying

The Common Fig is a gynodioecious plant which means its fruits are either hermaphrodite and inedible figs or caprifigs In traditional culture in the Mediterranean region they were considered food for goats caprifig means goat fig In the female fig trees the male flower parts fail to develop they produce the edible figs

Fig wasps grow in caprifigs but not in the female syconiums The female flower is too long for the wasp to successfully lay her eggs in them Nonetheless the wasp pollinates the flower with pollen from the caprifig it grew up in When the wasp dies it is broken down by enzymes inside the fig This means you do not eat the wasp because it has been dissolved The wasp does not transmit any diseases harmful to humans

There is typically only one species of wasp capable of fertilizing the flowers of each species of fig For example in Hawaii some 60 species of figs have been introduced but only four of the wasps that fertilize them have been introduced so only four species of figs produce viable seeds there This is an example of mutualism in which each organism benefit each other in this case reproductively

The intimate association between fig species and their wasp pollinators and the one to one plant pollinator ratio are a clear example of co evolution Recent genetic and molecular dating analyses have shown a close correspondence in the evolution and speciation of these two clades figs and wasps

Grapefruit is a citrus fruit grown in sub tropical places It is bigger than an orange and is often more sour but many types of grapefruit have other flavors

The tree which the grapefruit grow on normally are 5 6 meters tall but can reach up to 15 meters tall It has dark green leaves that measure up to 150mm and has white flowers that grow 5cm in length The fruit itself can grow 10 15cm in diameter In 2007 there were about 5061023 tons of grapefruits made worldwide most of the tons coming from the US There are many different kinds of grapefruits with different color pulp The most popular colors are red white and pink There are also a wide range of flavors grapefruits have From highly acidic and bitter to sweet

Grapes are the fruit of a woody grape vine Grapes can be eaten raw or used for making wine juice and jellyjam Grapes come in different colours red purple white and green are some examples Today grapes can be seedless by using machines to pit the fruit Wild grapevines are often considered a nuisance weed as they cover other plants with their usually rather aggressive growth

Raisins are the dried fruit of the grapevine and the name actually comes from the French word for grape 

Since the early 21st century in the United States and other countries and the global functional food industry there has been a fast growing recognition of red grapes for their popularity nutrient content and antioxidant qualities This has given them commercial status as a superfruit

The leaves of the grapevine itself are considered edible They are used to make dolmades

Grapevines are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization 75866 square kilometres of the world is used to grow grapes About 71 of grapes are used for wine 27 are used as fresh fruit and 2 are used as dried fruit A part of grape production goes to making grape juice to be used as a sweetener for fruits canned with no added sugar and 100 natural The area dedicated to vineyards is increasing by about 2 per year 

The following list of top wine producers shows the areas used to grow grapes for wine making although of course country size is a limiting factor as well as the economic demand for their product 

Comparing diets among western countries researchers have found that although the French usually eat more animal fat than other countries the number of cases of heart disease remains low in France Many scientists think this is because the French drink more red wine than other countries Something in the grape helps lower the amount of cholesterol in the body This helps prevent clogging of the arteries Doctors do not recommend drinking a lot of red wine but three or four glasses a week is good and encouraged

Grapes of all colors offer benefits Red wine offers health benefits that are not found in white wine This is because many of the good nutrients are found in the skins of the grapes and only red wine is fermented with the skins

White grapes are derived from the red grape by evolution Changes in two genes turn off creation of anthocyanin Anthocyanin is what makes red grapes the color red

A raisin is any dried grape A currant is a dried Zante grape The name is a corruption of the French raisin de Corinthe A sultana was originally a raisin made from a specific type of grape of Turkish origin The word is now used for raisins made from common North American grapes and chemically treated to resemble the traditional sultana

Note that while raisin is a French loanword the word in French means the fresh fruit Grappe means the bunch

Note also that currant has also come to mean to the blackcurrant and redcurrant These two berries completely unrelated to grapes

A lychee is a tropical fruit in the genus Litchi It comes from southern China Since it is tropical it will only grow in a warm wet climate

The inside of a lychee is a clear pinkish white colour The outside of the fruit is a hard spiky shell Its seed is brown in colour and very hard The seeds are poisonous and should not be eaten The fruit is rare because dragonfruit climbs the bough on lychee plants causing them to die 

Cherry is a fruit that grows on a tree or a bush It belongs to the genus Prunus It is usually red with a seed in the middle It tastes slightly sour and is often used to flavour cakes and ice cream or is baked in a pie or cobbler Cherries are also a good source of Vitamin B

Blackcurrant is a small bitter tasting fruit It can be found in central and northern Europe and northern Asia

Blackcurrant has a lot of vitamin C in it Blackcurrant gets its name from its dark color It is also used to make jelly ice cream and cordial Blackcurrant is a popular flavor in the United Kingdom Blackcurrants are also used in salads and in baking similar to raisins

The word date can mean 

The Date Palm is a palm It has been cultivated for a very long time because of its edible fruit This fruit is called date The tree is between 15m and 25m high It has long leaves that look like feathers Such leaves are called pinnate The leaves can grow to 3 5 metres in length The leaves have visible spines There are about 150 leaflets Each leaflet can be up to 30 cm in length and 2cm in breadth The full span of the crown of the tree is 6 to 10 metres

The tree has one or more trunks that all come from a single system of roots 

World production of dates was approximately 67 Mio tonnes in 2004 The major producers are

The First International Date Conference was held in Tripoli Libya in 1959 In that conference it was decided to develop a special program under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to promote the commercial use of substandard or physically defective dates

Cherimoya is a sweet fruit that comes mostly from Peru Ecuador Colombia and Bolivia The inside of a cherimoya is soft and it is white in color The skin of the cherimoya fruit is green when it is ripe and brown if it becomes too ripe The cherimoya has large black seeds They are poisonous and should not be eaten like the skin The cherimoya is special because it can be grown in high places

A blueberry is a berry a very small fruit It grows in a type of tree called a shrub Many types of blueberries grow in North America and eastern Asia Blueberries are more common between May and October

Blueberries have a sweet taste with a little acidic hint Wild blueberries have a stronger taste Blueberries are good for making jelly jam pie muffins and many other foods 

Simply speaking momentum of an object is defined as the product of the mass and velocity of the object It is a vector quantity which has both direction and magnitude Its unit is kg ms or N s Momentum is sometimes referred to as linear momentum which is different from its related subject angular momentum

Momentum is a conserved object meaning that the total initial momentum of a system must be equal to the total final momentum of a system Total amount of momentum remains unchanged

Momentum can be considered the power when an object is moving meaning how much force it can have on another object For example a bowling ball pushed very slowly can hit a glass door and not break it while a baseball can be thrown fast and break the same window The baseball has a larger momentum than the bowling ball Because momentum is the product of the mass and the velocity of an object that both mass and velocity affect the momentum of an object As shown an object with a large mass and low velocity can have the same momentum as an object with a small mass and large velocity

The meaning is that the net force on an object is equal to the rate of change in momentum of the object

This equation also applies in special relativity but with m being the relativistic mass of the object

Impulse is the change in momentum cause by a net force

In understanding conservation of momentum the direction of the momentum is important Momentum in a system is added up using vector addition Under the rules of vector addition adding a certain amount of momentum together with the same amount of momentum going in the opposite direction gives a total momentum of zero

Malmo is the third largest city in Sweden About 265000 people live there It is in the south west part of the Sweden by the sea The resund bridge goes from Malm to Copenhagen In the 15th century Malm was one of Denmarks largest cities

Malm has the biggest Middle Eastern community in Sweden It is warm in the summer In winter it is not quite as cold as in other parts of the country

A skull or cranium is a set of bones that make up the head of a vertebrate and keep in place all body parts in the head Its hard bones keeps the brain safe Inside the skull are air pockets called sinuses which act like cushions for the brain When you have a headache in your forehead it is usually because the sinuses are filled with fluid due to allergies

In humans the adult skull is normally made up of 28 bones A skull is also used as a symbol of poison or death when used with crossbones

Sandstone is a sedimentary rock It is a rock made of compacted sand which is mostly quartz andor  feldspar the most common minerals in the Earths crust

Sand particles are cemented with either calcite quartz or clay Iron oxide often makes it a reddish colour 

Sandstone which is resistant to weathering is used for building in many countries It can be a very hard rock For example paving slabs can be made out of hard sandstone 

A pseudonym is a fake name a person uses instead of their real name Many people use pseudonyms including authors and performers People use pseudonyms for several different reasons to hide identity gender andor race People also use pseudonyms to match their stage personality better

There are three main types of pseudonyms pen names stage names and user names Pen names are used by authors usually to hide identity Many famous books such as The Outsiders and A Series of Unfortunate Events have been written by authors using a pseudonym Daniel Handler wrote A Series of Unfortunate Events under the pseudonym Lemony Snicket both because he wanted to make the author a character in the story and because he wanted to hide his real name When she published The Outsiders Susan Eloise Hinton decided to use her initials S E instead of her first and middle names because she did not want readers to guess her gender The Bront sisters used pseudonyms to hide the fact that they based many of their characters on their neighbors

Musicians actors and performers also use pseudonyms called stage names both to hide their identity and to give themselves a cooler name For example rapper Sean Combs is currently known by Diddy but used to call himself P Diddy and Puff Daddy He says that he changed his name from P Diddy to Diddy because the name caused confusion and he wanted to simplify things 

Many people on the Internet use pseudonyms There are many names for these pseudonyms including user names user IDs and handles These pseudonyms help people stay anonymous on the internet and they also protect people from identity theft and phishing When people log into an account on sites like Wikipedia MySpace or Facebook their user name helps identify them without entering their real name If people used their real name instead of a user name it would create confusion for two people with the same name Usernames make this simple because people create their own user names Also if someone used their real name it would make it easier for people to guess their passwords and for other people to find them in real life

A pen name also known as a pseudonym is a name an author uses in the place of their real name when they write and publish things For example the Bront sisters who were famous authors in the 19th century used them because they feared that people would make fun of a book written by a woman Charles Dodgson a math professor took the name Lewis Carroll when he wrote fantasy stories

A stage name is a name an entertainer like a movie star or a musician takes in the place of their real or birth name they might like this name better than their real one or its easier for people to remember Professional wrestlers use stage names also in their case its called a Ring name Actors and actresses choose stage names for a variety of reasons Their real names may be the same as or similar to those of other people or they may be difficult to say or spell

Fermats Last Theorem is a very famous idea in mathematics It says that

Pierre de Fermat wrote about it in 1637 inside his copy of a book called Arithmetica He said I have a proof of this theorem but there is not enough space in this edge However no correct proof was found for 357 years It is widely speculated amongst mathematicians everywhere that Fermat in fact did not have a good proof of this exciting and revolutionary theorem

The proof was made for some values of n Fermat Euler Sophie Germain and other people did this 

However the full proof must show that the equation has no solution for all values of n The proof was very difficult to find and Fermats Last Theorem needed lots of time to be solved

An English mathematician named Andrew Wiles found a solution in 1995 Richard Taylor helped him find the solution Wiles did a lot of secret work He wanted to be the first

After a few years of debate people agreed that Andrew Wiles had solved the problem Andrew Wiles used a lot of modern mathematics and even created new math when he made his solution This mathematics was unknown when Fermat wrote his famous note so Fermat could not have used it This leads one to believe that Fermat did not in fact have a complete solution of the problem

The Monica Lewinsky scandal was a famous scandal where United States President Bill Clinton was said to have had oral sex with 22 year old Monica Lewinsky Though he did not admit to the affair until the annual White House prayer on September 11 1998 in the presence of several ministers priests and his wife Hillary Clinton in his infamous I have sinned speech The speech was hand written by Clinton himself and was delivered on the day of publication of the first report by Independent Counsel Ken Starr which threatened to impeach President Clinton in the grounds of perjury and his sexual affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky

Guam is an island in Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean that is part of the United States It is a territory and not one of the 50 US States The people that first lived there are called Chamorros The capital of Guam is the city of Hagta The largest city is Dededo Guam has important United States Air Force and Navy bases which use a lot of Guams land Guam also has a lot of tourists

Guam was one of the first islands in the Pacific Ocean to be visited by Europeans In 1521 the first European to visit Guam was Ferdinand Magellan on his voyage around the World Spain took over Guam in 1668 and it was an important place for Spanish delivery boats every year going between Mexico and the Philippines known as the Manila Galleon During this time the people on Guam learned a great deal about the Spaniards

In 1898 the United States had a war with Spain and took Guam under the Treaty of Paris which also brought the giving of Cuba the Philippines and Puerto Rico from Spain Guam continued to be important due to its strategic location both for shipping and air travel in the Pacific During World War II Japan captured Guam in 1941 but the US fought to get it back in 1944 This meant that the Chamorro people on Guam were on a different side of the war than the Chamorro people on the nearby Northern Mariana Islands Even though the Northern Mariana Islands were also taken over by America they still feel different from the Chamorro people on Guam

In 1950 the US Congress passed a law making the people of Guam American citizens

Most people on Guam are happy to be Americans The American military bases make some jobs for a lot of Guam people Being part of America also helps bring visitors from Japan who spend money

But some people on Guam do not like Guam continuing its status as a US territory They want to be a more important part of America Some of these people want Guam to be a commonwealth like Puerto Rico A few others want Guam to be a US State or for Guam to be its own country But the United States does not think this would be a good idea Guam needs a lot of money from the US government which it would lose if it changed into a commonwealth a state or its own country Also changing Guam might mean the US would have to give up some of the important military bases

Guam gets most of its money from the United States government Much of that money is spent on the military bases but there are also federal grants given to the Guam government for various programs Because it is only a territory federal income taxes paid by Guam residents are given to the Guam government for its operations 

Guam also gets a lot of money from visitors on vacation Almost all of these visitors are from Japan Japanese tourists like Guam because it is closer to Japan than other American places Guam has lots of hotels and other fun places for people to visit Tumon Bay is Guams biggest beach It has lots of pretty white sand and the water has lots of fish Tumon is becoming a busy city

Today Guam has less visitors than it did a few years ago because Asia has had some trouble This means there are fewer jobs on Guam and it has lost money

Guam is 212 square miles large In the north part it has a flat area of coral and limestone rock The south part has mountains Around the island is a coral reef

Guam is next to the Marianas Trench which is the deepest part of the Earth and underwater It sometimes has earthquakes some of which have been very strong

Guam is a tropical island It is usually quite warm and wet and the temperature does not change very much From February to July it is dry but the rest of the year it is rainy Sometimes Guam has very strong and dangerous storms in October and November

After World War I he was elected on the promise to return the United States back to normal He supported limited government in the economy During his term he lowered taxes and believed that the economy should not be regulated too much

Warren G Harding made the mistake of appointing his friends to high political positions In result they corruptly abused their power for their personal gain and several scandals happened during his presidency 

He died of a heart attack in 1923 while he was the president His vice president Calvin Coolidge became president after he died 

Historians generally consider him one of the worst presidents due to his lack of political skill

Bangladesh is a country in South Asia It is next to the North east Indian provincial regions of India which converges with Southeast Asia to the east Its full name is The Peoples Republic of Bangla Desh The capital and the largest city is Dhaka Bangladesh is surrounded on all three sides by the Republic of India and is in close proximity to the Peoples Republic of China Bhutan Sikkim and Nepal Its independence was fully realised after it declared it self as independent most of 1971 from Pakistan after a bloody war in which over a million people died Later by Indian military intervention by that time the provisional government went into exile in Calcutta Bengal which they considered their homeland to be under Pakistani military occupation After the Instrument of Surrender the Bengali peoples became a sovereign nation and when its founder was released from political imprisonment had returned in 1972 Present day Bangladesh has an area of 55126 mi or It is bigger than Tajikistan but smaller than Nepal 

The local currency is called Taka The official language is Bengali

There are two main rivers in Bangladesh the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers are holy to Hindus There are often floods because of these two rivers 

Islam took in shape foothold in the 13th century Bangladesh used to be called East Bengal after they had fought hard for a Muslim homeland in 1947 and was made a part of United Pakistan However by 1955 its citizens were commonly referred to as East Pakistanis Dacca was then the legislative capital of Pakistani Bengal provincial region The peoples of East Pakistan were mostly ethnic Bengalis who had a different language and culture to the people of western Pakistani These differences eventually led to Liberation war On 16 December 1971 Bangladesh gained independence with the help of allied forces against West Pakistani forces 

After the birth of Bangladesh Bangla replaced Urdu and English as the sole national and official language and was the language taught in schools and used in business and government The Bangla Academy was important in this change In the 1980s British style education was maintained through private English language institutions attended by upper class children English continued to be taught in higher education and was offered as a subject for university degrees 

At first Arabic also lost ground in independent Bangladesh This trend ended in the late 1970s however after Bangladesh strengthened its ties with Saudi Arabia and other oil rich Arabic speaking countries An unsuccessful attempt was made in 1983 to introduce Arabic as a required language in primary and secondary levels Arabic is widely studied in Madrassas and Islamic institutions around the country for better understanding of the Quran Hadith and any other Islamic texts

Despite 30 years of independence Bangladesh is still a poor country and has problems with corruption and political troubles as the other country have Presently more than half of the people can read and write

Bangladesh has heavy cyclones and natural disasters which because of carbon release at a higher ratio by Rich Country and warming the world Due to this many lives are often lost The country is one of the most densely populated in the world Cyclones are very common in the Bay of Bengal during the middle of the year particularly in the south of country in areas like Sundarban Chittagong Coxs Bazaar or in neighboring Myanmar and Republic of India Despite the many storms Bangladesh does not have a very effective storm prevention system and cyclones usually inflict heavy damage Therefore the rich country should come forward and help Bangladesh to have a effective storm prevention system being they are liable for all these Cyclones

Yugoslavia was a country in Europe mostly in Balkan Peninsula its meaning South Slavs deriving from Slavs who came from area what is now Poland It existed in three forms during 1918 2003 From 1918 until 1928 it was called the Kingdom of the Serbs Croats and Slovenes From 1928 until World War II it was the Kingdom of Yugoslavia After the WW 2 it was renamed to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with six republics 2 autonomous provinces Bosnia Herzegovina Croatia Macedonia Montenegro Serbia and Slovenia and two autonomous provinces in Serbia Vojvodina in the north and Kosovo next to Albania North Kosovo always had majority Serbian Christian population It remains to this day under full SerbianBelgrade defacto control In 1991 came the independence of Slovenia Croatia in 1992 Macedonia Bosnia and Herzegovina causing the end of the country Serbia and Montenegro were the last two republics in the Socialist Yugoslavia In 1992 they formed a new Federal Republic of Yugoslavia On 3 February 2003 the FRY became the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro In mid 2006 the state union ended when Montenegro decided to be independent 55 of voters voted yes

Now Yugoslavia has been split up and made into these countries

Major League Baseball is the company in the United States and Canada that is in charge of professional baseball Both the American League also called AL and National League also called NL are part of the company Even though it is named major league the company is also in charge of much of the minor league of baseball The company owns everything that happens in major league baseball games It also includes MLB Productions and MLB Advanced Media which are in charge of major league baseball games on television and the teams and company web pages There are 30 different major league teams

The 30 teams in MLB are divided into two leagues and each league is divided into three divisions The AL West has four teams and the NL Central has six The other divisions all have five teams

Each team in Major League Baseball is scheduled to play a 162 game season This season begins in April and ends in October The teams play other teams in their own division the most and play very few games against teams in the other league Teams usually play each other in series of three or four games at a time If a game is cancelled because of bad weather it may be held again at a different date sometimes as part of a doubleheader Sometimes these games are not held again if it would not affect either teams place in the standings If teams are tied at the end of a season they may play an extra game to decide which one will play in the playoffs In July there are three days where teams do not play normal games and a group of players voted on by fans play in the All Star Game This period is called the All Star Break and it is thought of as the point where half of the season is over Lately some games at the beginning of the regular season have been played in other countries such as Japan

There is one difference between games played in the American League and games played in the National League The American League teams play with a designated hitter a player who bats in place of the pitcher and does not play in the field In the National League the pitcher must bat along with the other players In games played in teams from both leagues the rule that the home team usually plays by is used

At the end of every season eight teams play in the playoffs Four teams from the AL and four teams from the NL are in the playoffs The team from the West Central or East division from each league with the most wins makes the playoffs a team with the best record in its division is said to have won its division The next best team in the AL and the next best team in the NL also get to play in the playoffs They are called wild card teams The first playoff round is called the Division Series In the Division Series teams play best out of 5 The team with the best record in the AL plays the Wild Card team unless the teams are in the same division where the team with the best record will play the division winner with the third best record The division winner with the second best record plays against the division winner with the third best record The NL teams play the same way The teams that lose are out of the playoffs The Al teams that win play in the AL Championship Series The NL teams that win play in the NL Championship Series The Championship series is best out of 7 games When there is only one AL team and one NL team left the teams play each other in the World Series These teams play the final best out of 7 games in the World Series to decide who that seasons champion is

The company called Major League Baseball began in 2000 Before then the American League and National League were separate companies that people called the major leagues MLB says that its history began in 1869 when the first team to get paid for playing baseball the Cincinnati Red Stockings was created

The first league of professional baseball teams began in 1871 and was called the National Association This league did not play baseball the same way MLB does For example batters would walk after nine pitches instead of four Many of the teams had problems with money and split up after only one or two seasons However two teams are still playing today Those teams were the Boston Red Stockings which today is the Atlanta Braves and the Chicago White Stockings which today is the Chicago Cubs In 1876 a league that was run better the National League began and included the Red and White Stockings as well as six other teams Even though this league was run better many teams still would split up after only a few seasons though some like the teams that are now called the Philadelphia Phillies and San Francisco Giants are also still playing today There were other leagues also The American Association started in 1882 and was almost as good as the National League However many of its teams would go to the National League and the American Association disappeared in 1891 The National League had problems though Players and fans did not behave well and once a fire that destroyed part of Boston happened at a game

Henry Louis Gehrig was an American baseball player He played with Babe Ruth and the New York Yankees who were thought the best team of that time He played with the Yankees for most of his playing time which started in 1923 and ended in 1939 He played in 2130 games without a rest which was the most of any player until Cal Ripken Jr in 1995 When he stopped playing as well he went to a doctor who found out Gehrig had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis The doctor told Gehrig he had only a short time to live On July 4 1939 there was a special observation of Gehrig by the other Yankees and Gehrig gave a public talk that became well known When he spoke that day he said he was the luckiest man on the face of the earth The mayor of New York City congratulated him for his teamwork He died less than two years later

The United States Senate is part of the United States Congress which is a group of elected people who decide the laws of the country

Every US state chooses two people from the state to work in the Senate These people are called senators Since there are 50 US states there are 100 senators Senators serve six years at a time and one third of them are picked every two years Originally the legislature of each state decided who their senators would be After 1913 all the people of the state chose their senators by vote The Vice President of the United States is in charge of the Senate but only does anything when there is a tie vote or a special event

The Senate along with the United States House of Representatives votes on which laws the United States should have In most cases both of these groups have to agree on the suggested law before it becomes a law

The Senate is the side of Congress where every state has the same number of votes This is different from the House of Representatives where states with more people have more votes than states with fewer people This was decided during the time the United States Constitution was written because small states like Rhode Island and Delaware did not want the larger states to be able to decide everything Also only part of the Senate runs for election during elections Every two years 33 or 34 senators are elected For each state this means that after two elections to the Senate during one election no one will be elected to the Senate

The Senate is also in charge of agreeing to treaties with other countries The President has to ask the Senate to agree with his choices of candidates for certain jobs in his office or in the government If the Senate and President do not agree the President has to pick someone else the Senate will agree to

In order to be a senator a person has to be 30 years old or older and has to be a citizen of the United States for 9 years or more He or she must also be an inhabitant of the state they represent at election time

Right now the Senate is made up of 41 Republicans 57 Democrats 1 Independent and 1 Independent Democrat

Fair use is the idea that it should be okay for a person to copy small parts of something another person has created without breaking the law

In most countries art and other made up things like stories books TV shows and pictures are owned by the person that first made them This person can let someone else own the things they make sometimes for money The person that owns these things has a copyright for them which means that person can decide who can copy their work If someone else copies that work without asking the owner first that person is breaking the law The owner can take the person to court and try to get money from them because of what they did

Since a lot of creative work is popular people want to talk about them and they may want to talk about them on TV or in a book This might mean that they want to use a little bit of it when they talk about it The idea of fair use was added to most copyright laws to make sure that it would be OK do to this as long as only a little bit of someones work is used

Since a lot of creative work is now on computers and on the Internet it is very easy to copy things and send them to lots of people To make sure that people cannot always do this there are computer programs that try to stop people from copying other peoples work One problem with these programs is that they also mean that you cannot copy even a small part of someones work so you cannot do fair use without cheating the program In some countries cheating those software programs is also breaking the law

Soil erosion is the washing or blowing away of the top layer of soil 

This is a serious problem for people who want to grow crops Crops are the foods that farmers grow If the soil has eroded the crops will not grow very well 

Soil erosion was a big problem in the Midwestern United States in the 1930s dust bowl

Erosion also leaves large holes in the earth which can weaken buildings and even cause them to collapse 

Soil erosion can be prevented several ways 

Compost is a type of fertilizer that is made from rotting plants It is easy and cheap to make as all it really requires is vegetable waste The vegetable waste is broken down by bacteria and made into compost

To make a compost heap you need some space fairly far from anyone who might have a problem with the smell The bottom corner of a garden or some other place a distance from the house is a good place Compost heaps should also be placed on soil or grass a paved yard or concrete are bad places The compost heap should not be in a dark or closed corner

The best base for a compost heap is a layer of sand bricks or gravel about 1m long by 1m wide This is not needed but it can be a good idea If using bricks leave spaces to allow the air to move through It also allows for the water to run away The best compost heaps have lots of little spaces inside to allow air to move around

Once the first layer is down one can begin adding the waste 

Some good types of waste are

Adding meat scraps is a bad idea as they rot slowly smell bad and attract rats and other vermin Human or pet feces is also a very bad idea as this can transmit disease Waste from plants that have died of disease is also bad The disease can spread to the plants that the compost is used with

When making a compost heap different types of waste should be layered A layer of cut grass can be followed by a layer of vegetable waste and table scraps

Watering the compost heap is a good idea especially in dry areas The water helps encourage the waste to rot and turn into compost

In anywhere from 3 to 6 months the compost will be ready The compost is ready when it smells like thick earth with no smell of decay or rot Of course if you have been adding waste all this time the compost will all be at the bottom of the heap and will have to be dug out

The stuff that has not rotted can be used as part of a new compost heap

It has a tropical climate and is called in French La Perle des Antilles because of its natural beauty It is very mountainous but is no longer covered with forests as it once was It is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere

Haiti is divided into ten departements There are two official languages French and Haitian creole or Kreyol The main religion is Roman Catholic however Voodoo derived from African folk beliefs in Benin is still widely practised also There are many holidays the largest and most important is the Mardi Gras

Haiti has a total area of 27750 km most of it is in the western third of the Hispaniola island and the rest are smaller islands that are near the Haitian coast such as tels que Gonve le de la Tortue Les Cayemites le Vache and La Navase

There are many mountains in Haiti with only some coastal plains and few valleys the largest valley is the Cul de Sac where Port au Prince is found in its western end The main Haitian river is the Artibonite which is also the longest of the Hispaniola The biggest city is Port au Prince with more than 3 millions of inhabitants in its metropolitan area the second city is Cap HatienHaiti has a tropical weather The rain season is from April to June and from October to November Tropical cyclones are common during summer and made a lot of damage and many people die

The native Arawak Amerindians  who lived in the island of Hispaniola when it was discovered by Columbus  were brutally killed by Spanish conquistadors within twenty five years 

In the early 17th century the French established a colony on Hispaniola and in 1697 Spain sold to the French the western third of the island Haiti The French colony based on forestry and sugar related industries became one of the wealthiest in the Caribbean but only through bringing many African slaves and destroying much of the environment In the late 18th century Haitis nearly half million slaves revolted under Toussaint LOuverture and after a hard and bloody struggle became the first black republic to declare its independence in 1804 University of Louisianaref Today there are many historic monuments remembering this one of the largest is La Citadelle Laferriere

On January 12 2010 at 2153 UTCthe island was struck by a magnitude 70 earthquake the countrys most severe earthquake in the past 200 years The epicenter of the quake was just outside the Haitian capital Port au Prince It has been estimated by numerous media that the death toll could reach 200000

Haiti is made of ten regions known as departments These departments are further divided into 41 arrondissements and 133 communes second and third level units of administration

The 10 departments with their capital cities in parentheses are

Haiti is currently the least developed country in the Americas The country is among the worlds poorest and least developed There are certain economic indicators that can be calculated to compare the social and economic situation of different countries Some of these indicators show that Haiti fell behind other low income developing countries since the 1980s In 2006 Haiti ranked 146th of 177 countries in the United Nations Human Development Index About 80 of the population were estimated to be living in poverty in 2003 Haiti is the only country in the Americas on the United Nations list of Least Developed Countries Economic growth was negative in 2001 and 2002 and flat in 2003

About 66 of all Haitians work in the agricultural sector Most of them do small scale subsistence farming but this activity makes up only 30 of the GDP In the last ten years very few jobs were created but the informal economy is growing Mangoes and coffee are two of Haitis most important exports Haiti has consistently ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world on the Corruption Perceptions Index

Foreign aid makes up approximately 30 40 of the national governments budget The largest donor is the United States followed by Canada and the European Union also contributes Venezuela and Cuba also make various contributions to Haitis economy especially after alliances were renewed in 2006 and 2007

US aid to the Haitian government was completely cut off in 2001 2004 after the 2000 election was disputed and President Aristide was accused of various misdeeds After Aristides departure in 2004 aid was restored and the Brazilian army led the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti peacekeeping operation Corruption is also very common on the island

Haiti is expected to receive debt forgiveness for about 525 million of its debt through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative by mid 2009

The population of Haiti is about 10090190 as of 2009 The ethnic groups of the population is 938 African descent 54 Mulatto and 08 other There is also a Asian minority and Arabs

1901 was a common year starting on Tuesday of the Gregorian calendar It was the first year of the 20th century

The university consists of 38 colleges and another 6 private halls All of these colleges have their own buildings and their own staff making Oxford quite different from most modern universities where all the students live on a campus Oxford does not have a campus although it does have some central places where students from different colleges can come together either to study or to enjoy themselves

Many people who study history think that there was a university in Oxford in the 11th century and the University of Oxford grew bigger in 1167 after English students studying in Paris France were not allowed to continue studying after St Thomas Becket was murdered on the orders of King Henry II of England There were fights between the students in Oxford and the people who lived there in the early 13th century Some students and teachers left the university in 1209 and made a new university in Cambridge These two universities are now great rivals and together are sometimes known as Oxbridge

Until 1920 women were not allowed to take degrees at Oxford although some women studied at Oxford before that time Nowadays all the colleges allow both men and women as students and the number of male and female students is roughly equal

One of the most famous teachers at the university was Lewis Carroll author of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass nonsense stories for children

There are 38 colleges at Oxford and 6 permanent private halls

A college will normally offer the students accommodation for the first and last years of their time at University Many also offer accommodation for other years A college will also have space for teaching and socializing When most of the older colleges started they were only for people of one sex but St Hildas College the last college to allow only women to study there recently allowed men as well

A permanent private hall is slightly different to a college They were normally started by religious groups to educate their members in philosophy and theology but some have since grown and offer a broader range of subjects Some halls are run by monks and will only accept male students

Most colleges will teach at both undergraduate and postgraduate level There are also some special colleges who are more restrictive Five college only offer space to postgraduate students Harris Manchester college is only for Mature Students All Souls college does not take students  all of its members teach students or do research 

Oxford like Cambridge is very popular with students and therefore it is harder for students to get into these universities The colleges look for the students with the best school results in the subjects for which they are applying

Winter storms or snowstorms happen when warm wet air meets with cold air The warm wet air mass and the cold air mass can each be 1000 km or more in diameter Snowstorms affecting Northeastern United States often get their moisture from air moving north from the Gulf of Mexico and cold air from air masses coming down from the Arctic In the Northwest United States warm wet air from the Pacific Ocean cools when it is pushed upward by the mountains Many different things can affect the direction of movement broken wikt linkmoistmoisture content and temperature of air masses All of these differences affect the type and severity of the snowstorm

Winter storms and blizzards can make several feet of snow that blow into big drifts Sometimes the drifts can be over ten feet tall They could even cover a house

Lots of popular winter storms are part of North Americas history In 1846 the Donner Party traveled away by covered wagons from Illinois headed for Sutters Fort near Sacramento California As a answer of bad decisions and slow going they tried to go across the big Sierra Nevada Mountains in the late October Usually California is still warm at that time of the year As the party crossed the Sierra Nevada Mountains they did not see any snow and was not worried However after they left a huge snowstorm hit The party was forced to camp near Truckee California The snow was so deep that the wagon wheels became stuck so they could not move anyplace They tried to wait the storm out but when one blizzard ended another began immediately before they had time to escape Their food became short so some of the people decided to hike out and find help rather than to starve to death Most of them died in the freezing weather and many of those who stayed behind in the camp survived Of the 87 people who started in Illinois only 47 lived

Reptile is the common name for one of the main groups of land vertebrates It is not used so much by biologists who use more accurate terms

The name reptile comes from Latin and means one who creeps All living reptile species are cold blooded have scaly skin and lay cleidoic eggs They excrete uric acid and have a cloaca A cloaca is a shared opening for the anus urinary tract and reproductive ducts Reptiles also share an arrangement of the heart and major blood vessels which is different from that of mammals

Many important groups of reptiles are now extinct The great marine reptiles of the Mesozoic era the ichthyosaurs plesiosaurs and mosasaurs are extinct We used to say the dinosaurs were extinct but they survive in the form of their feathered descendents Ancient reptiles that do survive include the turtles the crocodiles and the Tuatara the lone survivor of its group The great majority of present day reptiles are snakes and lizards

The study of living reptiles is called herpetology

Reptilia is an evolutionary grade rather than a clade The main reason is that the term reptile does not include birds the descendents of theropod dinosaurs Thus instead of Reptilia as a taxonomic class today most experts use Class Sauropsida Class Synapsida includes mammals and all their forebears Reptile is still the usual informal term to describe living Sauropsids Mammals are a genuine clade and hence Mammalia remains the taxonomic term 

Since reptiles are not monophyletic reclassifying them is one of the key aims of researchers Some taxonomists such as Benton make Sauropsida and Synapsida as class level taxa The two groups split in the Lower Carboniferous from stem group Amniotes

A snake is a member of about 19 reptile families that has no limbs voice ears or eyelids They also have a long slender body

About 2900 snake species are known to exist and most of them live in the tropics Their skin is covered with scales They can see well and they can taste the air with their tongues by flicking them in and out Though they do not have a voice they hiss instead Most live on the ground others live in the water and some live under the soil Snakes do not have legs Like all reptiles snakes need the heat of the sun to control their body temperature Thats why most snakes are in the warm humid tropical regions of the world

Snakes have lots of colors on their scales Snakes that have dull coloured skin use it for camouflage Those that have brightly coloured skin are usually poisonous They use their bright colors to warn predators to stay off Some non poisonous snakes pretend to be poisonous by having the same patterns and bright colors of poisonous snakes to fool predators 

Snakes need to shed their skin regularly while they grow This is called moulting Snakes shed their skin by rubbing their head against something rough and hard like a piece of wood or a rock This causes the skin which is already stretched to split open The snake keeps on rubbing its skin on various rough objects until the skin peels off from its head This lets it crawl out turning the skin inside out

All snakes eat other animals Some snakes are venomous They use the poison in their teeth to help them bite and capture an animal at once Constrictors are not venomous so they simply strangle their prey They move by pushing and pulling themselves with the muscles on the bottom of their bodies and are very fast They swallow their food whole sometimes by dislocating their jaws Once the snakes prey is in its body its internal muscles crush it so the animal can be digested They are cold blooded carnivores and some eat large prey Some feed on rodents such as mice others may feed on birds fish eggs lizards or even other snakes They capture their prey in many ways

Even though snakes seem to eat a lot they can go without eating for several days or longer People who own pet snakes feed them as infrequently as once per month Some snakes can go as long as six months without a good meal

A mouse is a rodent which is a kind of mammal These small animals are often used in science experiments or sometimes kept as pets Some mice carry diseases This causes some people to think of mice as disgusting pests Many other people think mice are cute and fun animals Mice are rodents therefore they are related to squirrels rats and beavers The words rat and mouse are sometimes used to mean the same animal but that is not correct Mice eat weeds seeds berries and more They are eaten by owls foxes and cats amongst others

The common House Mouse is thought of as a pest They are found in the cars and houses of humans

These are short tailed mice Female voles may have 17 litters a year with 4 9 babies in each litter

These mice live in forests 

The aggressive grasshopper mouse sometimes eats other mice

Two mice found in popular culture are Disney characters Mickey and Minnie Mouse Though they are mice they can walk talk and act like people

Chuck E Cheese is another famous mouse He is the mascot of Chuck E Cheeses pizza restaurants

Advance Wars is a video game for the Game Boy Advance It is based on earlier games for Nintendo systems such as the Famicom and Game Boy It is a strategy game players must think of ways to win

The game can be played with two three or four players at a time Each player takes turns controlling their military style playing pieces called units Every unit can move along the playing field which is split up into squares The amount of squares a unit can move in one turn is different for each unit

Most units can attack other units Each unit has its own strength and defense Strength is how much damage the unit can do to another unit Defense is how much damage it can avoid taking whenever it is attacked For example the tank unit has more defense than the soldier so even though the helicopter always has the same amount of attacking power it can do more damage to the soldier than the tank

The Solomon Islands are a group of islands in the South Pacific They are known for their beauty and for the many languages spoken there The capital of the Solomon Islands is Honiara

The intestines of an animal are like a hollow tube so that food and bile from the stomach can reach the rectum They also take any useful compounds from the digested food through small villi or tiny microvilli These are very small hair like structures in the walls of the intestine It is also called bowel and is part of the alimentary canal between the stomach and the anus

A chemical equation is a way to predict the way that two or more chemicals will work together Using what chemists know about the way chemicals act we add the letter symbols together just like a math problem In this way we can correctly guess if we will get a new chemical when we mix two or more chemicals together and what that chemical will be

Chemical equations are either worded or written using the elements symbols how much of the element and in what state it is in

For example An aqueous solution of Sodium Chloride and another aqueous solution of Silver Nitrate These mixed together forms Sodium Nitrate and Silver Chloride

Which in symbols is

NaCl AgNO3 NaNO3 AgCl

The solutions formed a solid named AgCl This formation can be called a precipitate and the reaction between the two solutions a precipitation reaction because the solid produced is not dissolved whereas all the other products are dissolved

Subtropical describes those parts of the world that are north and south of the tropical zone The edge of the tropical area in the north is the Tropic of Cancer at latitude 235N and in the south it is the Tropic of Capricorn at 235S The subtropical area is between 20 and 40 degrees of latitude in both hemispheres It has a mild climate

Lucifer is another name for Satan This is because people interpret a passage in the Book of Isaiah of the Bible in a certain way Lucifer is Latin It is made of two parts lux lucis and ferre There are two mentions of Lucifer in the Latin Vulgate It is used to refer to the morning star the planet Venus that appears at dawn once in bibleverse2Peter119 to translate the Greek word which has exactly the same literal meaning of Light Bringer that Lucifer has in Latin and once in bibleverseIsaiah1412 to translate which also means Morning Star

Lucifer is the Latin name for the Morning Star both in prose and poetry as seen in works by Marcus Terentius Varro Cicero and other early Latin writers

Cicero wrote

And Pliny the Elder

Poets also used the word Lucifer Ovid has at least eleven mentions of the Morning Star in his poetry Virgil wrote 

And Statius

Lucifer is very evil in the Christian religion He is also the symbol for not obeying Lucifer is believed by some to be Satans name when he was still an angel but it is Latin for light bringer and not originally in the Bible The word Lucifer was also used in Latin to mean the morningstar the planet Venus and this word was used in the Latin version of Isaiah 14 where the Hebrew version was speaking to a king of Babylonia  

The reason people came to think this was a name of Satan has been argued about for many years Some people think that it is a misnomer or a wrongly given name Others believe that he was the best out of all the angels before he rebelled against God

Astrobiology is the study of life in outer space The field of astrobiology looks for conditions necessary for life like liquid water a good temperature or the presence of oxygen

Three possible places to find life in the solar system are Europa and Ganymede moons of Jupiter and Titan a moon of Saturn These places may have liquid water They are may be too cold to support life on their surfaces but if they have liquid water the water must be warm enough to support life

A castle is a fortified structure made in Europe and the Middle East during the Middle Ages People argue about what the word castle means However it usually means a private structure of a lord or noble This is different from a fortress which is not a home and from a fortified town which was a public defence For about 900 years that castles were built they had many different shapes and different details

Castles began in Europe in the 9th and 10th centuries They controlled the places surrounding them and could both help in attacking and defending Weapons could be fired from castles or people could be protected from enemies in castles However castles were also a symbol of power They could be used to control the people and roads around it

Many castles were built with earth and wood at first often using manual labour and then had their defences replaced by stone instead Early castles often used nature for protection and did not have towers By the late 12th and early 13th centuries though castles became longer and more complex

Europe began using gunpowder in the 14th century It did not stop castle building at first But by the 15th century shots became powerful enough to break through stone walls Castles were still built but new ways to protect castles from cannons and guns made them uncomfortable places to live in Because of this people stopped building true castles Instead country houses or military forts were built From the 18th century people began building castles again from new interest in Gothic architecture but they were not used for fighting

The word castle comes from the Latin word castellum which is a diminutive of the word castrum meaning fortified place The Old English castel French chteau Spanish castillo Italian castello and many other words in other languages also come from castellum The word castle became a part of the English language soon after the Norman Conquest to describe this new type of building However though these words all came from the same basic meaning they can describe different types of structures For example the French chteau can simply be used to describe a great country house in the middle of an estate

A castle is seen by most to be a private fortified residence This makes it different from earlier fortifications such as walled cities like Constantinople and Antioch in the Middle East Castles were not made to protect the community They were built and owned by lords either for themselves or for their ruler

A castles main defense was a wall A wall was used to block the offensive side from breaking into a castle The tops of the walls were cleverly made Imagine a mouth smiling but with every other tooth missing The soldiers could hide behind the stone teeth and be safe while they fired down at the soldiers attacking the castle This feature was called battlements The rooms inside the castle sometimes had small holes or slits cut in the walls so the soldiers could fire out through them without being hit These were called arrowloops The way a person or thing got into a castle was through a gate A gate was a mostly wooden structure with a heavy metal gate behind it This was used for two purposes To let allies in or out To keep enemies out If the offense did get past a gate the offense would be littered with missiles and other objects through a murder hole in the upper part of the gate The gate was also one of the most protected objects in a castle Some castles also had moats which were water filled ditches encircling the whole castle where the only way in was over a drawbridge which was a heavy wooden door that could be pulled up by chains to protect the main gate and let down to act as a bridge over the moat to allow access to the castle You could also pour oil that was hot down a hole The soldiers attacking the castle sometimes tried to knock down the castle walls or dig under them A siege was when the attackers just sat outside and waited When the people inside were starving they had to give up and come out which is called surrender A siege could go on for months if the castle had plenty of food and water

Castles were built for defense until about 500 years ago at the end of the Middle Ages After that people still built very big stone buildings They looked like castles but they had bigger windows and more fireplaces and were much more comfortable Really they were just great big houses When castles were built to be homes instead of fortresses the word Castle was often put at the front of the name One example is Castle Oliver in Ireland This had 215 windows and 65 chimneys as well as dozens of bedrooms It was built about 150 years ago It is very light and bright inside because it was built to have parties not to keep out soldiers

Many castles are very beautiful and are public Sometimes you can see furniture and clothes armour musical instruments carpets cannon and other weapons that once belonged to the people who lived there Some castles have legends of ghosts Some had very famous owners like mad King Ludwig of Bavaria Some only a very few are still lived in by the families who built them Many others have become hotels or museums

Castles seem romantic and mysterious to us now but they were cold dark places to live often damp Because the walls were so thick sometimes 12 feet or more they never got warm Their windows also had no glass in them Castles might have been safe but they were not very comfortable

The Republic of Bulgaria is a country in southeastern Europe

The capital and the biggest city is Sofia The currency is the Bulgarian leva The Bulgarian government is a member of the European Union and NATO It is preparing to join the Euro zone Therefore Bulgaria would change over to the euro after several years The current president is Georgi Parvanov The population of Bulgaria is reported between 7094 up to 7351 million people

Bulgarias official language is Bulgarian The Bulgarian language is a Slavic language It is related to languages like Serbian and Russian Bulgaria became independent in 1908 from the Ottoman Empire Bulgaria borders Romania Serbia the Republic of Macedonia Greece Turkey and the Black Sea One of the national heroes of Bulgaria is Vasil Levski His real name is Vasil Ivanov Kunchev He was born in Karlovo in 1837

In what became todays Bulgaria many cultures took place including Neolithic Hamangia culture Vina culture eneolithic Varna culture and the Bronze Age Ezero culture The thracians inhabited of modern Bulgaria King Tere united the people in Odrysian kingdom around 500 BC Alexander the Great had influence over the people on the 4th century and later by the roman empire 46 AD Slavic people settled all over the territory of modern Bulgaria during the 6th century

The first Bulgarian empire was established in 681 AD But the first Bulgarian Empire came to fall under the pressure of the Byzantine Empire The second Bulgarian empire was ruined by the Ottoman empire for about 500 years until the Bulgarians rebelled against the Turkish rulers and exclaimed independence but still the power was under ottomans controls After the first balkan war Bulgaria pulled away from Ottoman Empires influence But after the war it remained unclear in the management of southern Macedonia and no diplomatic solution arrived on time and the war on landmark erupted when Bulgaria wake up war against the alliance of Serbia and Greece which have allied together When Serbia and Greece attacked Bulgaria the bulgarian army could resist them But Romania arrogantly joined the alliance against Bulgaria and pushed Bulgarias land troops back 

In a successful appearances in the first world war in alliance with the Central Powers and the countrys administration and landmarks where largely unaffected 

During the first year of World War II Bulgaria said it was neutral and refused to join pacts with Germany Balkan or Soviet But the increased tension in the war made the leadership to sign the three powers pact with Germany in March 1941 Which led to that German forces could entering through Bulgaria to reach Greece

Bulgaria had signed the three powers pact with Germany in March 1941 But Bulgaria did not follow Hitlers wishes Bulgarias troops refuse to participate in the military coups and also refused to take part in the holocaust This made Adolf Hitler very suspicious

In 1944 when it became clear that the allied will win the war so now Bulgaria had to find and looking for another solution whose leadership declared that they withdrew from the Axis forces and opened up their borders to Soviet troops But the Soviet Union didnt respect Bulgarias transformation in to neutrality and therefore the red army was making an coup against Bulgaria and they took over the control of the country The Soviet Union replaced the royal monarchy with a communist regime in 1947 before they withdrew from Bulgaria

In the early 1990s as the Soviet Union began to collapse Bulgaria grew more independent of Soviet policy 

Within a few years of the fall of the Berlin Wall Bulgaria experienced serious economic problems under the socialist government that took power after the communists fell in 1989 Since that time Bulgaria has recovered in some ways After some real economic reform and responsible fiscal planning the government has become more stable Problems in the administration a weak court system and organized crime are the biggest issues for Bulgaria

Bulgarias economy was dependent on the COMECON market but succumbed in 1989 Living standards fell by 40 percent and a lot of newborn babies where sent to orphanages United Nations sanctions against Yugoslavia affected Bulgarias administration negatively

In 1994 Bulgaria had a temporary economic boom But that slowed down in 1996 due to the nature of bad international collaboration and unstable banks Since 1997 the economy has grown steadily Foreigners investors took place in Bulgaria and took for the whole trade In addition very large privatization of the business

Bulgaria have Europes lowest income and corporate tax 10 percent for both individuals and businesses This makes Bulgaria a very attractive country to do business in In addition Bulgaria has a skilled and educated workforce The average monthly salary in Bulgaria is 400 euro or 541 USD The state does not respond anymore to free health care or other care This system has been replaced by a contributory health insurance scheme and drug costs are based on income Private health care is encouraged nowadays General unemployment compensation does not exist but some compensation is based on family status and length of unemployment

The retirement age for men is 63 years and for women 60 years

The Alps is the greatest mountain range of Europe It reaches from Austria and Slovenia in the east through Italy Switzerland Liechtenstein and Germany to France in the west The original meaning of the word was white

The highest mountain in the Alps is Mont Blanc at convert4808mft0 on the ItalianFrench border

The Alps stretch from Austria and Slovenia in the east through Italy Switzerland Liechtenstein and Germany to France in the west

The mountains are divided into the Western Alps and the Eastern Alps The division is along the line between Lake Constance and Lake Como following the Rhine The Western Alps are higher but their central chain is shorter and curved they are located in Italy France and Switzerland 

The Eastern Alps belong to Austria Germany Italy Liechtenstein Slovenia and Switzerland The highest peaks of the Western Alps are Mont Blanc 4808 metres Mont Blanc de Courmayeur 4748 metres the Dufourspitze 4634 metres and the other summits of the Monte Rosa group and the Dom 4545 metres The highest peak in the Eastern Alps is Piz Bernina 4049 metres Perhaps the most famous location for tourist to the Alps are the Swiss Alps

The main chain of the Alps follows the watershed from the Mediterranean Sea to the Wienerwald defining the northern border of Italy It then passes over many of the highest and most famous peaks in the Alps From the Colle di Cadibona to Col de Tende it runs to the west before turning to the northwest and then to the north near the Colle della Maddalena Upon reaching the Swiss border the line of the main chain goes about northeast a heading it follows until its end near Vienna

The Alps do not make an impassable block they have been traveled by for war and commerce and later by pilgrims students and tourists Crossing places by road train or foot are called passes These are depressions in the mountains into which a valley leads from the plains and hilly pre mountainous places

The Union Internationale des Associations dAlpinisme has defined a list of 82 official Alpine 4000 meter peaks The list has many sub peaks with little prominence but good for mountaineering Here are the twelve four thousanders with at least 1 km prominence

Karl Blodig was the first person to climb all the main four thousand meter peaks round 1900

The reason mountains form is usually the moving together of continental plates of the Earths crust The Alps rose as a result of the slow but gigantic pressure of the African plate as it moved north against the stable Eurasian landmass

This all took place in the Tertiary period mostly in the Miocene and Pliocene Thats about 35 to 5 million years ago

The Alps are just a part of a larger orogenic belt of mountain chains called the Alpide belt It reaches through southern Europe and Asia from the Atlantic Ocean most of the way to the Himalayas 

A gap in these mountain chains in central Europe separates the Alps from the Carpathians off to the east Subsidence is the cause of the gaps in between

A great and ancient ocean was once between Africa and Europe the Tethys Ocean Now sediments of the Tethys Ocean basin and its Mesozoic and early Cenozoic strata sit high above sea level Even metamorphic basement rocks are found high on Mont Blanc the Matterhorn and other high peaks in the Pennine Alps and Hohe Tauern

The formation of the Mediterranean Sea is a more recent development

The Alps are popular both in summer and in winter The Alps as a place for sightseeing and sports Winter sports can be learned in most regions from December to April In summer the Alps are popular with hikers mountain bikers paragliders and mountaineers There are also alpine lakes which attract swimmers sailors and surfers The lower places and bigger towns of the Alps are well served by motorways and main roads but higher passes and by roads can be bad even in the summer Many passes are closed in winter Many airports around the Alps as well as long distance rail links from all bordering countries afford large numbers of travelers easy access from abroad The Alps normally has more than 100 million visitors a year

The typical treesoak beech ash and sycamore maple have a natural height limit the tree line Their upper limit matches the change in climate which comes with increasing height The change from a temperate to a colder climate is also shown true by a change in the wild flowering plant life This limit normally lies about convert1200mft 1 above the sea on the north side of the Alps On the southern slopes it often reaches to convert1500mft 1 sometimes even to convert1700mft 1

The Alps do not always have the typical trees People have felled them in many places Except for the beech forests of the Austrian Alps forests of the typical deciduous trees are hardly found Where such woods were Scots pine and Norway spruce now grow These trees are less sensitive to the attacks of goats who eat the saplings of deciduous trees

Above the tree line there is often a band of dwarf pine trees which is taking place of dwarf shrubs These shrubs are Rhododendron ferrugineum or Rhododendron hirsutum

Rwanda is a country in Africa It is near Burundi Congo Kinshasa Uganda and Tanzania The official language is Kinyarwanda The country has three ethnic groups Bahutu Batutsi and Batwa It is now known mostly because it is the place where the most efficient genocide in history happened

During the Scramble for Africa Belgium conquered Rwanda The Belgians then began to divide Rwandans into groups Bahutu and Batutsi The Belgians picked people that they thought looked more European to be abatutsi The rest became abahutu The Belgians told Rwandans that Batutsi were superior to Bahutu They allowed Batutsi to rule over Bahutu

In 1962 Rwanda became independent and Bahutu were given power Thus anti Tutsi purges occurred frequently Many abatutsi fled to Uganda where they formed the Rwandan Patriotic Front or RFP which tried to invade Rwanda in 1990

On the night of April 6 1994 dictator Juvnal Habyarimanas plane was shot down but it is still not clear who did it Within a half hour roadblocks manned by the Interahamwe militia were seen all over the capital Kigali The Rwandan Genocide had begun It would last for about 100 days and it would leave over one million Tutsi and moderate Hutu dead The main weapon used was the machete or umupanga Other countries paid little attention to the killing On July 2 1994 the RPF captured Kigali

Rwanda has now put behind its genocide history and now concentration on building the economy through tourism and other means Rwanda is famous for the mountain gorillas in Parc De Volcans Tourism is one of the top foreign exchange earners in Rwanda More information on Rwanda Safaris Guide

Fillmore became president in 1850 when the 12th president died The Whig party did not pick him to run for president in 1852 He ran for president in 1856 for the Know Nothing Party but lost

Millard Fillmore grew up in a poor family He worked hard to do well in school and went to college He got a job as a lawyer in 1823 In 1828 he was voted to be part of the New York congress and made friends in the Whig Party This helped him get chosen to run for vice president in 1848

When he was vice president Millard Fillmore was in charge of the United States Senate while it was fighting over a decision about slavery involving Texas and New Mexico 

When he became president the slavery issue was very intense

Fillmore signed the Compromise of 1850 Although the Compromise of 1850 made the northern states and the southern states get along the peace did not last forever In the late 1850s the north and the south stopped getting along

His decision to sign the Compromise of 1850 made many of the people in his Whig Party upset at him They stopped him from running for president in 1852

He started the first library at the White House

After Fillmore Franklin Pierce became the 14th president Fillmore got a job in charge of the University of Buffalo Fillmore joined the Know Nothing Party and tried to run for president again but the Know Nothing Party was not very successful

There is a statue of Millard Fillmore at City Hall in Buffalo New York

John Tyler was the 10th President of the United States of America from 1841 to 1845 He was the first vice president to become president after the president before him died He lived from March 29 1790 to January 18 1862

Tyler grew up in Virginia and became a lawyer His father was also a lawyer who later became governor of Virginia Tyler became a state representative in the United States Congress and then also became governor of Virginia like his father

Tyler started in government as a member of the Democratic Party but later he changed to the Whig Party which was very new He was chosen to run as vice president next to William Henry Harrison Whig Party people used to say Tippecanoe and Tyler Too to get people to vote for them

Harrison and Tyler won the election but Harrison died one month later Tyler then became president

Some people thought that Tyler was not the real president because he had not been elected But the United States Constitution says that the vice president takes over if the president dies and Tyler said that meant he was the new president At first the rest of the government agreed and declared him the new president But the Whig Party did not want Tyler to be president and a lot of people called him the accidental president or His Accidency

Tyler made the Whig Party angry when he picked people from the other party to work in his government He wanted to bring the two Parties to work together but instead this made him unpopular He rejected many of the Whigs ideas The Whig Party decided not to pick him to run for president in 1844

While he was president Florida became a new state Texas was its own country after winning a war against Mexico Tyler wanted Texas to be a US state and tried to make this happen while president but it did not happen until a few months afterwards

The Whig Party did not want Tyler to be president again and did not pick him to run for president in 1844 He had some friends in the Democratic Party who sometimes asked him for ideas but that Party did not like him enough to be president either Tyler was sometimes called the President without a party since both groups did not want him

When the Confederate States of America was created Tyler thought that states should be allowed to make their own laws even about slavery He did not want a civil war Instead he tried to get the United States to agree to let the southern states keep slavery But the United States Congress said no and Tyler decided that Virginia had to join the Confederacy He later was elected to the Confederate congress but died before taking the job

Kentucky Fried Chicken or KFC is a chain of fast food restaurants known for their fried chicken It was started by a man named Colonel Harland Sanders in Corbin Kentucky in 1952 They are now all over the world They not only sell chicken but other things like salads and french fries Its Finger Lickin Good has been their slogan since it was created

KFC has been criticised for different things Greenpeace accused KFC of destroying the Amazon Rainforest This is because KFC bought their soy they use for chicken food from Cargill The soy has been traced back to the European KFC Cargill has reportedly been exporting soy illegally for several years The Greenpeace organization researched the issue and brought it to the attention of the parent company YUM Brands Inc The parent company denied the illegal operation and said that their supply of soy is grown in parts of Brazil Greenpeace has called on KFC to stop purchasing soy from Cargill to avoid contributing to the destruction of the Amazon

Since 2003 animal rights and welfare organizations led by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals have been protesting KFCs treatment of the animals used for its products These groups claim that the recommendations of the KFC Animal Welfare Advisory Council have been ignored Adele Douglass a former member of the council said in an SEC filing reported on by the Chicago Times that KFC never had any meetings They never asked any advice and then they touted to the press that they had this animal welfare advisory committee I felt like I was being used

KFC responded by saying the chickens used in its products are bought from suppliers like Perdue Farms Tyson Foods and Pilgrims Pride and that these suppliers are routinely monitored for animal welfare violations Several PETA undercover investigations and videos of these and other KFC suppliers purport to show chickens being beaten ripped apart and thrown against walls contradict KFCs claims PETA has criticised some of the practices of chicken breeders such as beak trimming and overcrowding but KFC says its suppliers meets UK legal requirements The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs recommends a maximum stocking density of 34 kgaround 30 chickensper square metre and say that in circumstances where beak trimming needs to be carried out to prevent the birds injuring each other only one third of the beak should be trimmed measured from the tip towards the entrance of the nostrils PETA states that they have held more than 12000 demonstrations at KFC outlets since 2003 because of this alleged mistreatment of chickens by KFC suppliers

In June 2008 KFC Canada agreed to PETAs demands for better welfare standards including favoring suppliers who use controlled atmosphere killing of chickens and other welfare standards as well as introducing a vegan sandwich at 65 of its outlets PETA has called off its campaign against KFC Canada but continues to demonstrate against KFC elsewhere in the world

When the Crusades happened Muslims controlled the Holy Land The Holy Land is a place that is very important for the three major monotheistic religions Islam Judaism and Christianity There are many important religious sites in the Holy Land This is the land now called Israel or Palestine 

Muslims got control of Nazareth Bethlehem and other religious sites during the Caliphate of Omar

There were many different crusades The most important and biggest Crusades happened from the 11th century to the 13th century There were 9 big Crusades in this time They are numbered 1 through 9 There were also many smaller Crusades Some crusades were even within Europe The smaller Crusades continued to the 16th century until the Renaissance and Reformation

The word Crusade is related to the word Cross and means a Christian holy war There is also the Arabic word Jihad referring to a holy war fought by Muslims All sides believed very much in their religions They also had political reasons for fighting The strong belief made people less able to understand other people during times when there was no peace The Crusades and Jihads caused very much loss of life and property for all sides Much of the conflict between religions today is still partly from the Crusades and Jihads The Crusades led to the bloodshed of many innocent people and it affected peoples views forever

Alexius I was a ruler of the Byzantine Empire When Alexius called for help to defend his empire against the Seljuk Turks in 1095 Pope Urban II asked all Christians to join a war against the Turks The Pope told the Christians that fighting the war would repay God for their sins and that if they died on a crusade they would go straight to heaven The Christian soldiers were called crusaders The armies marched to Jerusalem attacking several cities on their way In 1099 they won the battle for Jerusalem and killed many As a result of the First Crusade several small countries were created One was named the Kingdom of Jerusalem A main cause of the crusade was the desperate need for land and retaking Jerusalem gave them both their Holy Land and land to live on

After some years of peace a man named St John of Clairvaux called for a new crusade when the town of Edessa was attacked by the Turks French and German armies marched to Asia in 1147 but were defeated

In 1187 Saladin recaptured Jerusalem Pope Gregory VIII started a new crusade led by several of Europes kings Philip II of France Richard I of England and Frederick I Holy Roman Emperor Frederick drowned in Cilicia in 1190 Richard left in 1192 after agreeing to stop the fighting with Saladin On Richards way home his ship was wrecked leading him to Austria In Austria his enemy Duke Leopold captured him and Richard was held

The Fourth Crusade was started by Pope Innocent III in 1202 with the idea to attack the Holy Land through Egypt The Venetians changed this crusade and went to the Christian city of Constantinople where they attempted to place a Byzantine exile on the throne After a series of misunderstandings and outbreaks of violence the city was sacked in 1204

The Albigensian Crusade was started in 1209 to eliminate the Cathars of southern France

The Childrens Crusade is a crusade of 1212 The story is that an outburst of the old popular enthusiasm led a gathering of children in France and Germany A boy from either France or Germany said that Jesus had visited him and told him to peacefully convert Muslims to Christianity Following this vision many children formed bands and marched to Italy There they were put onto ships which either capsized in a storm or which went to Morocco where the children were sold into slavery There are several versions of the story This had led some people to believe that this did not really happen but most people do believe

It looks like there were really two groups of people who moved in 1212 Both movements were very similar For this reason those who wrote the chronicles put them together as a single movement

In the first movement Nicholas a shepherd from Germany led a group across the Alps and into Italy in the early spring of 1212 About 7000 arrived in Genoa in late August However their plans did not bear fruit when the waters failed to part as promised and the band broke up Some left for home others may have gone to Rome while still others may have travelled down the Rhne to Marseille where they were probably sold into slavery Few returned home and none reached the Holy Land

The second movement was led by a shepherd boy named Stephen de Cloyes near the village of Chteaudun In June of that year the boy said that he had a letter for the king of France from Jesus He could gather a crowd of over 30000 and went to Saint Denis There he was seen to work miracles On the orders of Philip II on the advice of the University of Paris the crowd was sent home and most of them went None of the contemporary sources mentions plans of the crowd to go to Jerusalem

Later chroniclers elaborated on these events Recent research suggests those taking part were not children at least not the very young In the early 1200s bands of wandering poor started cropping up throughout Europe These were people displaced by economic changes at the time which forced many poor peasants in northern France and Germany to sell their land These bands were referred to as pueri in a condescending manner in much the same way that people from rural areas in the United States are called country boys

In 1212 a young French puer named Stephen and a German puer named Nicholas separately began claiming that they had each had similar visions of Jesus This resulted in these bands of roving poor being united into a religious protest movement which transformed this forced wandering into a religious journey The pueri marched following the Cross They associated themselves with Jesuss biblical journey This however was not a prelude to a holy war 

At that time chronicles were mostly kept by the Catholic Church They were written in Latin

Thirty years later chroniclers read the accounts of these processions and translated pueri as children without understanding the usage So the Childrens Crusade was born The resulting story illustrates how ingrained the concept of Crusading was in the people of that time the chroniclers assumed that the pueri must have been Crusaders In their innocence they returned to the foundations of crusading characteristic of Peter the Hermit and met the same sort of tragic fate

According to Matthew Paris one of the leaders of the Childrens Crusade became Le Matre de Hongrie the leader of the Shepherds Crusade in 1251

During 1213 AD Pope Gregory IX pushed Frederick II into leading the Fifth Crusades The Church tried another crusade to attack the Holy Land A crusading force from Hungary Austria and Bavaria captured Damietta a city in Egypt in 1219 The crusaders had to surrender due to a losing the battle for Cairo This crusade only last for one year From 1228 1229

In 1228 Emperor Frederick II set sail from Brindisi for Syria He did this after the Pope excommunicated him By talking to the Turks he had success and Jerusalem Nazareth and Bethlehem was given to the Crusaders for ten years without fighting This was the first major crusade not initiated by the Papacy a trend that was to continue for the rest of the century

The Templars argued with Egypt in 1243 In 1244 Egypt attacked Jerusalem Louis IX of France started a crusade against Egypt from 1248 to 1254 It was a failure and Louis spent much of the crusade living in Acre In the midst of this crusade was the first Shepherds Crusade in 1251

The Eighth Crusade was organized by Louis IX in 1270 to help the Crusader states in Syria However the crusade was diverted to Tunis where Louis spent only two months before dying

Before he was king Edward I of England started a crusade in 1271 He retired the following year after a truce The Crusader states lost everything after this

In time the people went on Crusades for other purposes They had become sad because they had often lost lost people they loved and had to pay lots of tax to help the Crusades The Crusades ended two centuries after they had begun

Although the Crusades did not do their first purpose and there were lots of bad results there were some good results People learned to be more understanding to others They brought back new ideas new materials for clothing lots of cultures and new spiritual views Many Catholics began to think that gentle ways should be used to make people believe in Catholicism Monks helped people of all religions Sometimes two religious groups fought together and also held their services in the same building

A sultan al ad Dn Ysuf ibn Ayyb was a famous arabic Sultan during the Crusades People in Europe and the United States also call him Saladin Many Muslims consider him a hero for defeating the Crusaders over twenty years worth of battles

He founded the Ayyubid dynasty of Egypt Syria Yemen Iraq Mecca Hejaz and Diyar Bakr Salah ad Din is a title which translates to The Righteousness of the Faith from Arabic

Many books were written about Saladin the things he did and the battles he won Daastaan Imaan Farooshoon Ki is one book in Urdu written by Althamash that says very good things about Saladin

In Buddhism enlightenment is when a Buddhist discovers the truth about life Bodhi means Enlightenment You can become Enlightened by following the Middle Way 

Buddhists generally achieve this using meditation whilst deeply concentrating and clearing their minds 

Siddhartha Gautama left the palace on the day his son was born and went to seek the Shramana teachers for guidance On his way he saw a poor man an old man a corpse and finally a sadu This made the Buddha believe that material goods mean little since we all die eventually and although this is sad and he felt almost nothing he was still content

His birth was said to be miracle His mother the queen was walking through the woods and two trees bent down for her to hold onto The birth was quick and painless 

The Buddha touched His goal of enlightenment after meditating for forty days under his bodhi tree This idea came to him after the ascetic ways of the Shramana teachers had failed to work for him and he remembered sitting under a tree as a child During this time he learned of his past lives and saw the past lives of other people Siddhartha Gautama became enlightened at the age of 35 and was called the Buddha

During his enlightenment he pointed towards the earth as a witness of his enlightenment he was offered to be free from nirvana but his decision was to stay on earth and teach others about the path to enlightenment He taught his first sermon in the deer park at Sarnath After his teachings he died at the age of 80

Ancient Greek was the language spoken by the people of Ancient Greece from the 9th to 4th century BC Ancient Greek and Latin are the most important ancient languages for speakers of English today This is because a very large number of English words come from Greek and Latin

The Greek language had many different dialects but the Attic Greek which was spoken by the people of Athens is thought to be the purest of the forms Because the Greeks became very powerful in the countries around the Mediterranean Sea their language spread very quickly Alexander the Great even took it into Asia Later in the Roman world children were taught Greek as a second language in the same way that many non English speakers today learn English as their second language

The great poems of the Ancient Greek poets like Homer were written in Greek The poems of the Iliad and the Odyssey tell exciting stories about warfare travel and the Greek gods In the 5th century BC some great plays were written by Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides This was the Golden Age of Ancient Greece the so called Hellenistic period These works of Ancient Greek literature inspired people for centuries and are still read today

All languages change with time and Greek has changed a lot since 25 centuries ago Modern Greek is often said to have started in the year 453 AD

Unlike Latin the Ancient Greek language is not considered a separate language from Modern Greek language but a different period in the history of the language up to the present day

Autobahn is the name for freeways in Germany Austria and Switzerland Those in Germany are famous because in many parts of the roads there are no speed limits and drivers can drive as fast as they want to

Usually an autobahn consists of two lanes in each direction Sometimes there may be more than two lanes for one direction

All drivers are supposed to drive on the outer most right lane unless they overtake other cars or trucks

Many autobahns in Germany have no speed limit There is only a speed recommendation of convert130kmmi1abbronlkon per hour However drivers going faster than 130kmh can be made responsible for an accident that they are involved in The German traffic law says that it is only permitted to drive as fast as the track conditions allow

An emergency phone is located at a German autobahn every convert2kmmi1abbrofflkon Junctions between two autobahns are called Dreieck if one autobahn ends there or Kreuz Junctions with normal roads are called Anschlussstelle All junctions of an autobahn are numbered sequentially

Driving on a German autobahn is free for cars and bikes Trucks do have to pay a toll of about a twelve cents per kilometre

On autobahns in Austria there is a general speeding limit of 130kmh However there were some test sections where 160kmh was allowed before April 2007 It is legal to drive with a car truck motorbike if you can drive with it more than 60kmh

Austrian autobahns are not free of charge Car drivers have to buy a vignette Trucks do have to pay a distance dependent toll On some sections you have to pay toll and need no vignette like big tunnels and other expensive buildings in the mountains

Junctions among Austrian autobahns are called Knoten and there is often a speeding limit of 100kmh

On the Wiener Sd Ost Tangente are about 200000 cars every day There is the most traffic in Austria and it is an important autobahn of the capital city Vienna

Autobahns in Switzerland have a speed limit of 120kmh Until 1997 they were called Nationalstrassen As in Austria car drivers have to buy a vignette which is always valid for one year Junctions between autobahns in Switzerland are called Verzweigung

Arnold Franz Walter Schoenberg was an Austrian born composer He was known for his twelve tone system of writing music

Schoenberg came from a strict Jewish family who had moved to Austria from Hungary They were quite poor and Schoenberg taught himself about music When he was grown up he had to do a lot of teaching to try and earn enough money to live In later life he went to live in the United States It took a long time before he was recognized world wide as a great composer His two most famous pupils were Alban Berg and Anton Webern He taught them how to write twelve tone music and they became famous composers

When Arnold Schoenberg was a young man he was living in the late 19th century In art and music the 19th century is often called the age of Romanticism If you look at the way composers wrote music at this time you will find that their compositions became more and more chromatic This means that more and more sharps and flats were used during the piece and the music went from one key to another very quickly Richard Wagner wrote very chromatic music especially in his opera Tristan and Isolde

Schoenbergs early works are mostly Late Romantic His piece Verklrte Nacht has very beautiful harmonies which go quickly from one key to another Gradually Schoenbergs music changed It became so chromatic that it was no longer in any key at all Music like this is much harder to understand His Five Orchestral Pieces were played by the conductor Sir Henry Wood at a Promenade Concert in 1912 The audience did not like it at first and took some time to get used to the sound

In 1923 Schoenberg developed the twelve tone system for which he is famous This is music which is based on a particular row of notes Twelve tone music is atonal because there is no feeling of being in any key because of the equal use of every pitch

The Anglican Church is the Church of England and its overseas offshoots Anglicanism is a Protestant form of Christianity It is sometimes seen as being the middle way between Roman Catholicism and extreme Protestantism This is because in the English Reformation the English Church kept the early Catholic ministry of bishops priests and deacons The critical point which led to the Anglican Church was the outright rejection of the Pope and so of the Catholic Church as an organisation

The main worship of Anglicans includes prayer Bible reading singing preaching Also the sharing of the bread and wine which represents the body and blood of Jesus Christ in a ceremony called Holy Communion 

Anglican beliefs range from the bread and wine becoming the actual Body and Blood of Christ in the course of worship to the idea of these two being shared at Holy Communion only as a memorial of the life that Jesus Christ gave for all humanity on the Cross The first is in the minority It is similar to the belief of Roman Catholicism and Orthodoxy The second is like the belief of most Protestants It is fundamentally a Protestant church because the Bible is the source of authority not the Pope

The name Anglican for this Church comes from the Latin word for English because the Church started in England In the British Isles Anglican has been the official or State religion in all parts at one time or another Anglican Church leaders and the State worked together in what is called the alliance of Throne and Altar or Church and State Together they tried to make the Anglican denomination as broad and welcoming as possible to a wide range of Christian believers 

They did this to try to get as many citizens as they could to worship in the official church 

In the British Isles and early British colonies this was done to try to defeat both the followers of the Roman Catholic Church and all the kinds of Protestants too by including their best ideas traditions and practices in the Anglican Church Now the only place in the United Kingdom where Anglicanism is still the official religion is England where the monarch Queen Elizabeth II is the Supreme Governor on Earth of the Church of England The effective government of the Church is by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the legal Church Parliament known as the General Synod

In the rest of the world Anglicanism was spread by overseas colonisation settlement and missionary work It functions there as an ordinary denomination of Christianity without special status Anglicans around the world join together in a group of national churches in countries where there are Anglican Churches to make the world wide Anglican Communion There are more than 80 million Anglicans in the world today Most live in Africa and Asia and are not of British ethnic heritage anymore

The Anglican Communion is struggling today with questions about the role of women and gay people in the Church There is a great chance that the Anglican Communion will not survive the stress of these serious issues and will split into liberal and conservative groups Already there are Anglicans who have broken from the main Churches to form their own separate groups of believers Some use the term Anglican combined with the word Catholic Christian Reformed or Episcopal 

At the same time leaders from the Anglican Communion hold talks with the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches to try to work toward Christian unity At times there has been some progress Also the Anglican and Lutheran Churches have agreed to a high level of shared beliefs leadership and practices called intercommunion

A leaf is an above ground plant organ Its main functions are photosynthesis and gas exchange A leaf is often flat so it absorbs the most light and thin so that the sunlight can get to the chloroplasts in the cells Most leaves have stomata which open and close They regulate carbon dioxide oxygen and water vapour exchange with the atmosphere 

Plants with leaves all year round are evergreens and those that shed their leaves are deciduous Deciduous trees and shrubs generally lose their leaves in autumn Before this happens the leaves change colour The leaves will grow back in spring

Leaves come in many shapes and sizes The biggest undivided leaf is that of a giant edible aroid This lives in marshy parts of the tropical rain forest of Borneo One of its leaves can be ten feet across and have a surface area of over 30 square feet

A leaf is a plant organ and is made up of a collection of tissues in a regular organisation The major tissue systems present are

The epidermis is the outer layer of cells covering the leaf It forms the boundary separating the plants inner cells from the external world 

The epidermis is covered with pores called stomata part of a stoma complex with a pore surrounded on each side by chloroplast containing guard cells and two to four subsidiary cells that lack chloroplasts Opening and closing of the stoma complex regulates the exchange of gases and water vapor between the outside air and the interior of the leaf and plays an important role in allowing photosynthesis without letting the leaf dry out 

Most of the interior of the leaf between the upper and lower layers of epidermis is a tissue called the mesophyll This assimilation tissue is the main place photosynthesis takes place in the plant The products of photosynthesis are sugars which can be turned into other products in plant cells

In ferns and most flowering plants the mesophyll is divided into two layers 

Leaves are normally green in color which comes from chlorophyll found in plastids in the chlorenchyma cells Plants that lack chlorophyll cannot photosynthesize

The veins are a dense network of xylem which supply water for photosynthesis and phloem which remove the sugars produced by photosynthesis Many leaves are covered in trichomes which have a wide range of structures and functions

What leaves look like on the plant varies greatly Closely related plants have the same kind of leaves because they have all descended from a common ancestor The terms for describing leaf shape and pattern is shown in illustrated form at Wikibooks

Different terms are usually used to describe leaf placement

Leaves form a helix pattern centered around the stem with the same angle of divergence There is a regularity in these angles and they follow the numbers in a Fibonacci sequence This tends to give the best chance for the leaves to catch light 

Two basic forms of leaves can be described considering the way the blade is divided 

Some leaves have a petiole Sessile leaves do not the blade attaches directly to the stem Sometimes the leaf blad surrounds the stem giving the impression that the shoot grows through the leaf 

In some Acacia species such as the Koa Tree the petioles are expanded or broadened and function like leaf blades these are called phyllodes There may or may not be normal pinnate leaves at the tip of the phyllode

A stipule present on the leaves of many dicotyledons is an appendage on each side at the base of the petiole resembling a small leaf Stipules may be shed or not shed

There are two subtypes of venation

In the course of evolution many species have leaves which are adapted to other functions

War on Terrorism or War on Terror is a campaign that the United States and some of its allies started to remove terrorist groups and to punish the states that sponsor terrorism The former US President Bushs argument was that the countries like North Korea Cuba Iran Iraq Afghanistan and Libya were a direct threat to America and its allies The term was typically used with a particular focus on militant Islamists and al Qaeda

Alkali metals are the chemical elements in group one of the periodic system They are silver coloured when pure soft and have only one electron in the outermost shell They like to make reactions in which they give up this single electron and then have a charge of 1 They react strongly with water and because of this they have to be stored in petrol Alkali metals are the first group in the periodic table They are never found in nature uncombined because they are unstable and they react fast to other elements They bond well with all elements except the noble gases When they are in air they turn black They have a one valence electron 

The alkali metals are Lithium Sodium Potassium Rubidium Cesium and Francium Lithium is the least reactive and francium is the most reactive although it is very rare

Sodium is the most important alkali metal One of the most important salts of sodium is sodium chloride It also forms a hydroxide sodium hydroxide which is commonly called caustic soda It is a very strong base

In spite of its critical success this movie had a mediocre run at the box office mostly because of a much bigger rival Steven Spielbergs E T

Many fans and critics have called NIMH Don Bluths most important work and magnum opus and masterpiece Even though this movie was not a big box office success An American Tail and 1997s Anastasia became his most successful works in later years

Marxist economics comes from the ideas of a philosopher named Karl Marx applied to economics He created it to explain the rules of motion of production and exchange under capitalism This theory was used to argue against the middle class theories of economics common at that time Marx wanted this to be a tool for the working class to use to overthrow capitalism and replace it with socialism then with communism Socialism would be a step towards the disappearance of the state and communism would be according to Marx a society where goods and services would be distributed to each according to his need from each according to his ability

Marx used the Labor Theory of Value which says that the value of a commodity is determined by the labor required to produce it More specifically Marx defined the value of a commodity as the Socially necessary labor time required to produce it the average time required to produce a given commodity under the average conditions of production It follows from this that the working class is responsible for the production of all of the value consumed by all members of society

Marx viewed the capitalist class those who control the means of production as leech like and unnecessary they are not necessary for the production of the goods society must consume in order to meet human needs and reproduce itself Rather Marx saw the capitalist class as getting wealth for itself by the exploitation of the working class Marx argued that wages under capitalism are determined not by the value created by workers during a given period of time but by the cost of their labor power He argued that the cost of labor power is determined by the cost of the goods and services necessary to maintain and reproduce workers So capitalists do not pay workers for the value they create they extract Surplus value the difference between the value created by a worker and the cost of their labor power from the working class In other words surplus value is unpaid labor performed by the working class for the capitalist class which Marx termed exploitation

Marx argued that because the capitalist class enriches itself by the exploitation of the working class the economic interests of the two classes are opposed and therefore irreconcileable He saw the dispossession of the capitalists and the seizure of control of the means of production by the working class as historically progressive in that it would bring about the end of class society remove the contradictions inherent under capitalism and qualitatively increase the scope of human development in myriad arenas

Victoria was the scene of much volcanic activity which started 40 million years ago The Western Volcanic Plains which cover 10 of the state are the third largest volcanic plains in the world Most of the plains were formed about six million years ago There are about 400 volcanoes on the plains

It is unknown exactly when humans settled in Victoria A site near Keilor has evidence of Australian Aborigines living near on the Maribyrnong River more than 31000 years ago Victoria was one of the most populated areas of Australiarp7 The Aborigines used fire stick farming to burn the volcanic plains regularly and they became some of the biggest grass plains in the world This supported large numbers of animals such as kangaroos and wallabies The Kulin federation were a large language group that lived on the plains and included the Watha wurrung Boon wurrung Woi wurrung Daung wurrung and Djadja wurrung people Other groups in Victoria included the Jari Jari Ladji Ladji Wemba Wemba Wergaia Jardwadjali Gunnai Waywurru and the Taungurungrp8 In the rivers creeks and wetlands the Aboriginals had built large fish traps to catch both fish and eels In the Yarra River wetlands some of these traps had stone walls about convert4ftcm0lkonabbron highrp6

Within ten years of the British settlement at Sydney in 1788 explorers began looking at the coast of Victoria The first settlement in Victoria was at Sorrento just inside the entrance to Port Phillip Bay A small group of 51 soldiers 308 convicts 17 free settlers 12 officials one missionary and his wife led by Lieutenant Governor David Collins set up camp at the end of 1803 They had come from England to set up a colony because the British government was worried that the French may try to claim the area However they were unable to find water and gave up the settlement within six weeks They went further south and began the settlement of Hobart Tasmania While at Sorrento a convict named William Buckley escaped He lived with Aboriginal tribes until meeting with Europeans again when Melbourne was settled in 1835 On 12 December 1826 Captain Samuel Wright Lieutenant Burchill explorer William Hovell and 21 convicts tried to start a settlement near Corinella on Westernport Bay This was also unsuccessful and the group went back to Sydney on 19 February 1828

Although the two official attempts to settle in Victoria had failed there were a number of unofficial settlements along the coast From 1820 small groups of people lived at various places along the south coast including Phillip Islandrp10 They were hunting seals and Southern Right Whales The Launceston Fishing Company had a base at Portland Bayrp11 These hunters were often in conflict with the Aboriginal communities The Europeans often captured Aboriginal women to use a slaves and for sexrp13 Edward Henty moved to Portland Bay and began sheep farming in December 1834rp12 These settlements were against the law as the British government was trying to restrict the areas of settlement They argued that they did not have the ability to provide support to remote and isolated settlements Repeated requests for official permission to settle in Victoria were refused by the governmentrp35

In 1835 a group of settlers farmers and government officials from Tasmania formed the Port Phillip Associationrp52 Led by John Batman who had heard about the grass plains from William Hovell the group decided to ignore the British government and move flocks of sheep to Victoria Batman landed at Indented Head Victoria on 29 May 1835 He began exploring Port Phillip Bay On 6 June 1835 he met with Aboriginal leaders near Merri Creek and made a treaty Under this treaty the Aboriginals agreed to allow Batman to use their land for his sheep In return they could continue to stay on the land they would be provided with food and goods and they would receive protection from other Europeansrp63 This was the only treaty ever made with the Australian Aborigines On 26 August 1835 the Governor of New South Wales Sir Richard Bourke said the treaty was against the law The land belonged to the crown and did not belong to the Aboriginals

At the end of 1835 the British government changed its policy on settlement in eastern Australia People were allowed to use large areas of the country for sheep farming If people paid a 10 fee they could settle wherever they liked These farmers became known as squatters as they sat on the land which they did not own The effect of this new policy meant that between 1835 and 1838 more land was settled than had been since 1788 It has been described as the fastest land occupation in historyrpIX By 1849 just 1019 squatters had taken over 177 million hectares of landrp202

The effect of the fast land occupation had terrible consequences for the Victorian Aborigines The squatters moved their sheep onto the grasslands that had once been the Aborigines main source of food The squatters built their farms near the waterholes and creeks where the Aborigines had camped for thousands of years The Aborigines began to kill sheep to eat and attempted to stop people from taking their land The early settlers tried to remove the Aborigines from the land Sometimes they were chased away and sometimes they were murdered For example at Murdering Creek near Camperdown 35 40 men women and children were shot dead by the manager of Glenorminston Station Frederick Taylor and several of his farm workers

Gold was found in Victoria at Clunes on 28 June 1851 With further discoveries at Ballarat Bendigo and Castlemaine there was a huge increase in the population as people came from all around the world
