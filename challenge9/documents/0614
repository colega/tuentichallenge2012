A prison is a building where convicted criminals are held 

Prisons are run by the government Other words for prison include penitentiary jail or gaol and correctional facility 

A person who has been charged with a crime but has not yet been convicted for it in a court may be sent to prison if

People held in prisons are called inmates or prisoners The word convicts may also be used but only if they have been sentenced to prison because of a crime 

People who have been sentenced to death are also kept in prison until their execution

In some countries prisons are also used for political prisoners In times of war prisoners of war may also be held in prisons 

Male and female inmates are usually kept in separate locations or in separate prisons Prisons are usually surrounded by walls and gates There are usually many locked gates inside the prison to control the inmates 

The inmates sleep in small locked rooms called cells Cells have a bunk bed a toilet and a sink Inmates are allowed to leave their cell every day for exercise Some inmates work in the prison during the day either in a factory or doing cooking or cleaning Law enforcement officers called prison guards watch the inmates The manager of a prison is called the warden

Prisons usually also include other buildings and facilities such as a chapel a library an exercise yard a gymnasium an infirmary visiting rooms kitchens and accommodation for prison staff

There are special prisons for people under the age of 18 who commit crimes These inmates are called young offenders or broken wikt linkjuvenilejuvenile offenders 

Prisons are a controversial topic that people have different views about 

As of 2006 there are currently nine million people in prison in the world The United States currently has the most people in prison it has more than 2 million people in prison In 2002 both Russia and China also had over 1 million people in prison In 2003 the United Kingdom had 73000 people in prison France and Germany had a similar number of people in prison

There are many books and poems about prisons or prison life such as The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas pre and The Ballad of Reading Gaol by Oscar Wilde 

There are also films that depict prison life including

There have also been television programs such as Prisoner Cell Block H and Prison Break

Mexico is a country in North America The United States is north of Mexico Guatemala and Belize are south of Mexico Mexico is between the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico

People living in Mexico or who are from there are called Mexicans Most Mexican people speak Spanish There are also Mexicans who speak Native American languages like Nahuatl Maya and Zapotec The capital of Mexico is Mexico City

Before the Europeans came many great Native American cultures existed in Mexico The earliest was the Olmec culture The Olmecs are famous for the large stone heads they made On the Yucatan peninsula lived the Mayans The Mayans lived in city states ruled by kings The Mayans were most powerful between 200 and 900 AD Another powerful culture was the one of Teotihuacan Teotihuacan was a very large city one of the largest at that time After Teotihuacan declined the Toltecs became powerful Toltec influence has been found from the southern parts of the US all the way to Costa Rica A famous Toltec god is Quetzalcoatl The Toltec culture declined too and it was succeeded by the Aztecs The Aztecs called their own empire Mexico A famous Aztec king was Moctezuma II

In 1519 the Spanish explorer Hernn Corts came to Mexico The Aztecs thought he was the returned Quetzalcoatl so they did not want to fight against him Cortes allied himself with the enemies of the Aztecs In 1521 they conquered the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan The Aztec Empire became part of Spain It was called New Spain

In 1810 the Mexican priest Miguel Hidalgo started the Mexican war of independence In 1821 the Spanish finally retreated and Mexico became independent The first leader of independent Mexico was Agustin de Iturbide he became emperor But the Mexicans were not happy with him and in 1823 the country became a republic

A man who was very important in Mexico in the early 19th century was Antonio Lpez de Santa Anna He was the president of Mexico 11 times When he was president Texas declared independence In this war the famous Battle of the Alamo took place Between 1846 and 1848 there was war between Mexico and the United States again In this war Mexico lost many areas After this war Santa Anna was sent away to Venezuela

Between 1858 and 1861 there was war again between liberals and conservatives The liberal Benito Jurez won the war and became president afterwards Juarez stayed president until France invaded Mexico and made Maximilian of Habsburg emperor But Maximilian was very unpopular He was executed in 1867 and Juarez became president again

Conservatives thought Juarez had too much power In 1876 they ousted him and made Porfirio Diaz a general who had won a battle against the French president Porfirio Diaz made the country wealthier but the poor people became poorer Franciso I Madero started the Mexican Revolution in 1910

The next 10 years the country was in chaos There were many presidents who ruled for a short time and all kinds of people fought against each other Famous people from this period are Emiliano Zapata Pancho Villa and Francisco I Madero When lvaro Obregn became president in 1920 the fighting calmed down

In 1929 President Plutarco Elas Calles founded the National Mexican Party PNM The party was later renamed Institutional Revolutionary Party PRI The party would rule for a very long time Most PRI presidents were not popular it was said that they were only president to become richer themselves An exception was president Lzaro Crdenas He was president between 1934 and 1940

After several decades more and more people became unhappy with the PRI In 1968 security forces shot at protesters this caused several hundred deaths and became known as the Tlatelolco massacre Another uprising was in 1994 when Zapatistas rebelled in the province Chiapas

Mainly through ballot box fraud the PRI managed to stay into power until 2000 when Vicente Fox of the National Action Party PAN was elected president In total the PRI had governed Mexico for 71 years

Mexico is a constitutional federal democracy ruled by a president The president is elected every 6 years The current president is Felipe Caldern He has spoken against American plans to build a wall between the two countries to slow illegal immigration

Mexico is in the southern part of North America and is roughly shaped like a triangle Mexico is more than 3000 km long from northwest to southeast Mexico is between two large seas the Pacific Ocean in the West and the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea in the East Mexico has two large peninsulas Baja California in the Northwest and Yucatan in the Southeast In central and western Mexico are the Sierra Madre mountains In the Sierra Madre is the Pico de Orizaba the highest mountain of Mexico In central Mexico there are also a few volcanoes like the Popocatpetl and the Iztacchuatl The Pico de Orizaba is also a volcano In the north of Mexico are deserts in the south are tropical rainforests Some rivers in Mexico are the Ro Bravo the Ro Grijalva the Ro Balsas the Ro Pnuco and the Ro Yaqui

Mexico is the most populous Spanish speaking country in the world It is also the second most populous country in Latin America 60 of the Mexicans have Native American and European forefathers they are called mestizos Almost 15 of the Mexicans are pure Native American and 10 are European Most Mexicans speak Spanish 10 of the Mexicans speak a Native American language like Nahuatl the language of the Aztecs Maya or Zapotec Most people in Mexico are Roman Catholic 6 are Protestant

The Atlantic Ocean is the body of water which is bordered

Scientists say that millions of years ago there was only one ocean and that most of the land in the world was joined together over where the Atlantic Ocean is now Eventually they think an enormous crack developed in the ground due to volcanic forces and that the continents started ever so slowly drifting away from each other The crack would have filled with water from rivers and eventually the sea might have broken through from the north and the south Even to this day the east coast of the Americas is shaped somewhat like the west coast of Africa but the difference is actually much greater than it might appear so it is not really an exact fit or even a close one The Atlantic Ocean is still growing now because of sea floor spreading from the mid Atlantic Ridge while the Pacific Ocean is said to be shrinking because the sea floor is folding under itself

The Atlantic Ocean has important ocean currents One of these called the Gulf Stream flows across the North Atlantic Water gets heated by the sun in the Caribbean Sea and then moves northwest toward the North Pole This makes France Ireland Britain Iceland and Norway in Europe much warmer in winter than Newfoundland and Nova Scotia in Canada Without the Gulf Stream the climates of northeast Canada and northwest Europe might be the same because these places are about the same distance from the North Pole

There are currents in the South Atlantic too but the shape of this sea means that it has less effect on South Africa This is also the place where foreignism takes place

Mercury means more than one thing

Mercury also known as quicksilver or hydrargyrum is a chemical element Its symbol on the periodic table is Hg and its atomic number is 80 Its atomic mass is 2006

The symbol Hg stands for its Latinized Greek name hydrargyrum meaning watery or liquid silver 

No one has the credit for finding mercury It was found in ancient history Mercury was found in Egyptian tombs that are from 1500 BC Chinese people also knew it from long ago In China and Tibet people thought using mercury would make them live longer and have better health One of Chinas emperors Qn Sh Hung D is said to have been buried in a tomb with rivers of flowing mercury He was killed by drinking a mixture of mercury and powdered jade because he wanted to live forever However this only made him die of liver failure poisoning and brain death The ancient Greeks used mercury in ointments The Egyptians and the Romans used it in cosmetics These cosmetics sometimes hurt and made faces uglier

Mercury is a silvery white liquid post transition metal The reason for mercury being a liquid is quite complex It is quite heavy a chunk of iron can float on mercury Compared to other metals it does not conduct heat well However it conducts electricity fairly well Mercury is the only metal with a known melting point lower than caesium Mercury is one of the two elements that are liquids at room temperature and normal pressure Bromine is the other one

Mercury may be seen as a transition metal but it is normally seen as a post transition metal It is in Group 12 of the periodic table Mercury has seven stable isotopes 202Hg is the most common isotope Mercury makes a blue to ultraviolet color in a tube when a spark is passed through it The ultraviolet light can kill germs

Mercury is an unreactive metal It does not corrode in air unless hydrogen sulfide is also there similar to silver Mercury can oxidize to mercury oxide when heated in air If it is heated further it decomposes into mercury and oxygen again It does not dissolve in ordinary acids but can dissolve in oxidizing acids to make mercury salts It can make amalgams when mixed with most metals like aluminium gold and zinc Iron tantalum tungsten and platinum do not make amalgams with mercury Iron flasks were used to trade mercury because of this

Mercury can dissolve large amounts of aluminium metal making it dangerous to transport in aluminium containers The thin layer of oxide on aluminium stops it from amalgamating aluminium but the oxide coating can be damaged to expose the metal Then the aluminium metal is dissolved and oxidizes to aluminium oxide The aluminium oxide forms a solid and releases the mercury which amalgamates more aluminium This process keeps repeating until a large amount of aluminium is dissolved

Mercury forms chemical compounds in 2 oxidation states 1 and 2 Mercury compounds are weak oxidizing agents and weak reducing agents Most of them are colorless They easily disproportionate to mercury compounds and mercury metal They react with oxygen in the air to make mercury compounds Many mercury compounds do not dissolve in water Mercury chloride is one of the most common mercury compounds Mercury compounds are strong oxidizing agents and very corrosive Mercury compounds are red yellow or colorless Mercury oxide and mercury chloride are the most common mercury compounds in the laboratory

Mercury is a rare metal It is about as common as silver Mercury is not expensive like silver because the mercury is very easy to get from the places where it is found Mercury can be found in elemental form in nature but this is not common Mercury as an element is the only liquid that is recognized as a mineral by the International Mineralogical Association It is most often found in the form of cinnabar a mercury sulfide mineral The biggest deposits of cinnabar used to be found in Spain but now are found in China It also occurs in other minerals like calomel a mercury chloride mineral

China and Kyrgyzstan are the two main makers of mercury Mines in Italy the United States and Mexico have been closed China is opening more mines because the European Union wants to use fluorescent lights which need mercury

Mercury is made by roasting cinnabar in a furnace The sulfide is oxidized to sulfur dioxide leaving mercury behind

Mercury is used in dental fillings They are an amalgam of mercury with another element An organic mercury compound called thiomersal is used to preserve vaccines Merbromin another organic mercury compound is used as an antiseptic It has been banned in some countries like the US

Mercury chloride has been used as a diuretic skin disinfectant and laxative Together with other mercury compounds Mercury chloride was used to treat syphilis The problem with this was that mercury chloride is very toxic Sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat It is also used as a disinfectant Blue mass a pill or syrup in which mercury is the main ingredient was prescribed throughout the 1800s for different conditions such as constipation depression child bearing and toothaches In the early 20th century mercury was given to children once a year as a laxative and dewormer Teething powders for infants also had it in them 

Since the 1930s some vaccines have contained the preservative thiomersal In the body this is changed to ethylmercury At first it was thought that this mercury based preservative can cause or trigger autism in children but scientific studies could not show such a link Because of this thiomersal has been removed from most US vaccines recommended for children six years of age and under There are certain exceptions to this rule for influenza vaccines In some cases vaccines may still have very small amounts of thiomersal in them

Cinnabar is still an important component of traditional Chinese Tibetan and Ayurvedic medicine Certain countries do not allow the use of mercury or its compounds in drugs For this reason cinnaber has recently been replaced with less toxic products 

Today the use of mercury in medicine has greatly declined in all respects especially in developed countries Thermometers and blood pressure devices using mercury were invented in the early 18th and late 19th centuries respectively Now their use is declining and has been banned in some countries states and medical institutions In 2002 the US Senate passed legislation to phase out the sale of non prescription mercury thermometers In 2003 Washington and Maine became the first states to ban mercury blood pressure devices Mercury compounds are in some over the counter drugs including topical antiseptics stimulant laxatives diaper rash ointment eye drops and nasal sprays The FDA has inadequate data to establish general recognition of the safety and effectiveness of the mercury in these products Mercury is still used in some diuretics although other things can be used for most therapeutic uses

Mercury is also used

Mercury is liquid at room temperature and fumes of mercury are very poisonous Ingested elemental mercury is less dangerous The biggest problems are organic mercury compounds which are eaten with food However inorganic compounds such as mercury nitrate are also highly toxic by ingestion or inhalation of the dust Mercury can cause both chronic and acute poisoning

In the year 1810 over 200 people died of mercury poisoning on the ship Triumph because a barrel of mercury had leaked 

Mercury is extremely poisonous and has to be used carefully When mercury is spilled there are special ways to clean it up Smaller drops should be combined to a larger drop on hard surfaces to be removed more easily Vacuum cleaners and brooms should not be used This is because they can spread mercury even more Afterwards elements such as sulfur or zinc powder should be sprinkled over the place then collected and cleaned away It is not easy to clean mercury entirely off clothing so it is better not to use them anymore Breathing in mercury vapor is also very dangerous

Africa is the second largest continent in the world It makes up about a fifth of the worlds land It is surrounded by large areas of water There are 61 countries in Africa and about a billion of the worlds population live there It is thought to be the continent where the first humans evolved

From north to south Africa has most types of climate In sequence from the north

Running north east to the south is the East African Great Rift Valley This has mountains volcanoes deep rifts and valleys rivers and lakes

In fact Africa has examples of most of the Earths climate types

Much of North Africa is dry and hot it is dominated by the Sahara Desert and does not receive much rain In Saharan Africa there are few rivers or other water sources Underground water sources such as springs are very important in the desert These often form oases An oasis is an area of vegetation surrounded by desert

In that part of the world the wind comes mostly from the east That does bring rain but the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau blocks the monsoon rain and prevents it getting to North Africa Also the Atlas Mountains near the north coast of Africa prevent rain from coming in from the north That is another rain shadow

These two rain shadows are mainly responsible for the Sahara desert

Conditions and winds are different further south where huge amounts of rain falls near the equator The equator runs across the middle of Africa That means much of Africa is between the two tropics

Slavery was long practiced in Africa Between the seventh and twentieth centuries the Arab slave trade took 18 million slaves from Africa via trans Saharan and Indian Ocean routes 

Between the fifteenth and the nineteenth centuries the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated 712 million slaves to the New World 

Between 1808 and 1860 the British Navy captured approximately 1600 slave ships and freed 150000 Africans who were aboard

In the late nineteenth century the European powers occupied much of the continent creating many colonial and dependent territories They left only two fully independent states Ethiopia and Liberia

Egypt and Sudan were never formally incorporated into any European colonial empire However after the British occupation of 1882 Egypt was effectively under British administration until 1922

The African Union is a 53 member federation consisting of all of Africas states except Morocco 

The African Union not to be confused with the AU Commission aims to transform the African Economic Community a federated commonwealth into a state under established international conventions 

The African Union has a parliamentary government known as the African Union Government consisting of legislative judicial and executive organs It is led by the African Union President and Head of State who is also the President of the Pan African Parliament A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP

In the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo neighbouring African countries became involved Since the conflict began in 1998 the estimated death toll has reached 5 million

Political associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co operation and peace between the continents many countries Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa often under the oversight of the state 

Most of such violations occur for political reasons often as a side effect of civil war Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include Uganda Sierra Leone Liberia Sudan Zimbabwe and Cte dIvoire

These are the countries of Africa

This list leaves out some islands

Countries with significant African descendents outside Africa

Africa has a lot of wildlife There are many types of animals there Some are cheetahs elephants lions snakes giraffes and a lot more Over 2000 types of fish live in African lakes and rivers

Butter is a dairy food product made by moving the cream obtained from whole milk for a long time The fat separates from the liquid It is commonly used as a spread on bread and a main ingredient in biscuits as a shortening agent in some baking and cooking recipes and sometimes as a frying medium

The Cold War was the tense relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union during the 46 year period following the World War IIs end but before the end of the Soviet Union It refers to the time between 1945 and 1991 The war was unlike any other war because the two countries armies never directly went to war with each other Many people feared that the relations would end in a nuclear war but that never happened 

Both the United States and Soviet Union had multiple countries on their sides These countries were known as satellite states or client states

The United Kingdom France New Zealand Australia West Germany Canada and the Netherlands are examples of countries on the American side East Germany Czechoslovakia Romania Hungary Poland were on the Soviet side Cuba North Korea China Mongolia and numerous other countries were friendly to the Soviets at various times 

The outbreak of the Cold War was due to the different ways of thinking  known as ideology  both in economy and government The United States had adopted Capitalism as their economic and governmental system while the Soviet Union chose Communism The United States was a democracy while the USSR was a dictatorship These differences led to a tense relationship between the two countries

The USSR and the United States were friends during World War II only because both countries did not approve of Nazi Germanys ideology While they were friends both the USSR and the United States still did not agree with each other in terms of government but both thought that it was more important to work together fighting against Germany

After WWII left Germany in tatters the Allies split it into four parts One part was given to the United Kingdom one part to France one part to the USSR and one part to the United States The Eastern German city Berlin also separated even though Berlin is located in the Eastern part of Germany which was the Soviet compartment The three Western countries compiled their sections of the country together to form a country known as the Federal Republic of Germany The USSR then named their section of Germany the German Democratic Republic The Western parts of Berlin were like the country placed together to form West Berlin a BRD enclave inside of the DDR

A proxy war is when two powerful countries fight indirectly There were some proxy wars during the Cold War For example when a third world country was in a civil war the United States might support the army which was anti communist and the Soviet Union would support the army which was pro communist For example author Michael Lind wrote that the Vietnam War was a proxy war between the United States the Soviet Union and China which had become a Communist country The Soviet Union and China worked together to help North Vietnam while not directly fighting in the war The United States directly fought in the war against North Vietnam

In 1953 Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin died and Nikita Khrushchev took his place A period of DeStalinization began and Khrushchev was trying to reverse many of the evil things Stalin did

During the 1950s there was a red scare in the United States During the Cold War many Americans were worried about Communists becoming powerful in the United States Many Americans were accused of being Communists especially Actors Artists and Political figures Accusing someone of being a communists was very serious because the Communists were the enemy of the United states at that time This was often done as a political attack Many actors were Blackballed and were not allowed to act in any movies after they were accused of being Communists The McCarthy Era was a period when many important or powerful Americans were accused of being communists Most of them were political opponents of McCarthy who had a powerful position in the government Many science fiction Hollywood movies were made in the 1950s and a lot of these films reflected the Red Scare that took place at the time Typically aliens from another planet began taking over small towns and the people in them and turning them into aliens too The aliens and creatures in these films reflected communists and the fear of them taking over 

The 1950s were the beginning of a space race between the US and USSR It began with the USSR putting the Sputnik satellite in space The US responded by starting NASA and soon sent up its own satellites

In the 1950s the United States created a policy called New Look which meant to reduce military defense spending while rapidly increasing the amount of nuclear weapons it had It was a policy of nuclear deterrence

United States Vice President Richard Nixon engaged in several talks with Nikita Khrushchev during the 1950s One of these was called the Kitchen Debate because it happened in a kitchen at the Worlds Fair These debates highlighted the political and economic differences between the US and the USSR As the end of the decade a United States plane which spied on the Soviet Union called U2 crashed This was very bad for US Soviet relations and the tensions between the two countries increased

After the United States tried to invade Cuba and failed the Soviet Union supplied Cuba with nuclear missiles The United States sent a large amount of ships around Cuba to stop the Soviet Union from delivering them nuclear weapons The United States and Soviet Union came to agreement that the Soviet Union will no longer give nuclear weapons to Cuba as long as the United States does not invade Cuba again This was the highest period of tension during the Cold War and it was the closest the world was to having a nuclear war Something that would have caused a chain reaction that could have spread around the whole world

This time period began after the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 and ended around 1980 The word detente means less tension between two countries In this case it meant an improved relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union During this time period as China began to dislike the Soviet Union the United States built a good relationship with China giving the Soviet Union a disadvantage during the Cold War During the 1970s the United States and the Soviet Union both signed several treaties which reduced the amount of nuclear weapons each country had

The policy of dtente ended in 1981 when president Ronald Reagan ordered a massive military build up to challenge the Soviet Unions influence around the world The United States began to support anti communists all over the world who wanted to overthrow their communist governments

The Soviet Union had a bad economy during this decade and was trying to keep up with the United States in military spending but could not The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979 and the Soviet Union was having a very difficult time winning against the Afghanistan freedom fighters The Soviet Unions failed invasion of Afghanistan is often compared to the United States failure during the Vietnam War

In the late 1980s the new Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev made an effort to make an ally of the United States to fix the world problems caused by the war However this did not take place under Gorbachevs presidency because the people of the Soviet Union chose to abolish Communism in their country due to its 80 year long failure the many global and local difficulties it caused and lack of freedom that they were forced to endure 

After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and without Communist rule holding the countries that compiled the Soviet Union together the USSR broke into many smaller countries like Russia Ukraine Lithuania and Georgia The nations of Eastern Europe became democratic governments and the period of the Cold War was over The Soviet Union ended in December 1991

Not all historians agree on when the Cold War ended Some think it ended when the Berlin Wall fell Others think it ended when the Soviet Union ended

Mainland China is the part of China not including the Republic of China controlling Taiwan Kinmen Matsu and the Pescadores The term also excludes Hong Kong and Macau 

In the Qing Dynasty all of Mainland China Hong Kong Macau Taiwan Kinmen Matsu the Pescadores and Mongolia were part of the Chinese Empire Taiwan Hong Kong and Macau were given to foreigners for some years

By the end the Qing Empire China became Nationalist China and it got Taiwan back in 1945 After the Communists took over most of China the Nationalists kept only Taiwan Kinmen Matsu and the Pescadores Mongolia became an independent state later

Since then Communist China only includes the part on the continent and some small islands that are very near This region is Mainland China

Later Hong Kong and Macau returned to the government of China but sometimes they are still not thought of as part of Mainland China

The endogenetic processes are the processes that shape the land by forces coming from within the earth 

There are 3 main endogenetic processes folding faulting and volcanism They take place mainly along the plate boundaries which are the zones that lay on the edges of plates These zones are weak Endogenetic processes cause many major landform features

The capital city is a city where the central government of a country or part of a country such as a state province or county is located

The leaders and officials work in the capital city

Capitals are usually large cities For example Montevideo is Uruguays biggest city and Uruguays capital However a capital is not always the largest city in a country For example the capital of the Republic of India is New Delhi which is smaller than Mumbai and the capital of Pakistan is Islamabad which is smaller than Karachi

Some countries have more than one capital like Bolivia which has two and South Africa which has three Some countries even claim their capitals as just the country itself like Monaco Nauru is a country that does not have a capital Some countries change capitals from time to time

Capitals can be in cities that are already there like London or new cities can be built and made the capital like Canberra

Climates mean the usual condition of the temperature humidity atmospheric pressure wind rainfall and other meteorological elements around a part of the earths surface for a long time Climate is different from weather Weather is the condition of these elements right now for shorter periods of time that are up to two weeks

The latitude ground and height can change the climate of a location It is also important to note if there are large bodies of water nearby Climates are most commonly classified by temperature and precipitation The most commonly used classification was first made by Wladimir Kppen The Thornthwaite system which was used from 1948 not only uses temperature and precipitation information evapotranspiration too This is why it is used in studying how many different kinds of animal species there are and about the things that could happen when climates change The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus more on where the air masses which help make climates come from

Climates can change after a long time Recently the world may be becoming warmer as is discussed in global warming

The climate of a place is given names such as Temperate Arid Cold Dry Tundra Tropical Equatorial Mediterranean Savanna etc 

Regions having a subarctic climate are characterized by long usually very cold winters and brief warm summers

Temperate climates have four seasons Some of the countries which have a temperate climate are Turkey and most of the European countries

Arid climates are hot climates like deserts They just have one or two seasons such as Saudi Arabia and most of the African countries

Tropical climates have warm temperature and only two seasons Wet and Dry

The Mediterranean climate is usually hot and dry in summer and is cool and wet in winter

The savannas climate is often tropical wet and dry See also Kppens climate classification scheme

The term fold is used in geology when one or a stack of originally flat level surfaces such as sedimentary strata are bent or curved as a result of pressure and high temperature The basic cause is likely to be some aspect of plate tectonics 

When two forces act towards each other from opposite sides rock layers are bent into folds The process by which folds are formed due to compression is known as folding Folding is one of the endogenetic processes it takes place within the Earths crust 

Folds in rocks vary in size from microscopic crinkles to mountain sized folds They occur singly as isolated folds and in extensive fold trains of different sizes on a variety of scales A set of folds distributed on a regional scale constitutes a fold belt a common feature of orogenic zones 

There are large scale and small scale folds Large scale folds are found mainly along a collision boundary between two tectonic plates 

The upfold is called an anticline The downfold is called a syncline

The imaginary line joining the highest points along the upfold is called the crest line 

The flanks of a fold are known as the limbs

The central line from which the rock strata dip away in opposing directions is called the axis of fold

According to the degree of folding of the layers folds can be classified into five main types

Large depressions called geosynclines form between plates Seas filled the geosynclines and rivers flowing into them carried sediments which build up on the sea bed Over millions of years the sediments were compressed by their own weight into sedimentary rocks eg sandstone limestone etc

Large scale folding will develop parallel ranges of round top mountains along destructive plate boundaries These mountains are known as fold mountains 

Examples of fold mountain ranges

Vulcanicity is one of the endogenetic processes 

Magma under the crust is under very great pressure When folding and faulting occur cracks or fractures which are lines of weakness When these lines of weakness develop downward in the crust and reach the magma they will release the pressure in the magma

This allows magma to rise up along the lines of weakness and intrude into the crust Some magma may even reach the Earths surface 

There are two types of vulcanicity intrusive and extrusive

Intrusive vulcanicity refers to magma being forced into the rocks that make up the Earths crust 

It occurs when there are lines of weakness such as faults joints or bedding planes in the crust Then magma enters these lines of weakness When it cools and become solid while still underground different features called plutons are formed The rock formed is intrusive igneous rock

These plutons will be exposed at the surface of land when the overlying rocks are removed after a long time of denudation

Major features formed by intrusive volcanicity include batholith laccolith dike pipe and sill

The magma under great pressure with molten materials forces its way through the fissure of the underground rocks and reaches the Earths surface to form igneous extrusion When the molten materials reaches the surface it is called extruded materials and such volcanic activity is known as extrusive or surface vulcanicitySome people classified extrusive vulcanicity into vent eruption and fissure eruption depending on how the magma rising to the ground

Major extruded materials include gasliquid and solid

Gas  sulphurhydrogencarbon dioxide and hot steam When uprising magma decreases in pressure suddenlygases within magma explode to the Earths surface and cause destruction

Solid  pyroclastMainly composed of fragments of country rocksolidified lava and fine materials of volcanic ash and dustIt can be classified in term of size into volcanic bombsvolcanic blockslapillivolcanic ash and volcanic dust

The Pacific Ocean is the body of water between Asia and Australia in the west the Americas in the east the Southern Ocean to the south and the Arctic Ocean to the north It is the largest named ocean and it covers one third of the surface of the entire world It joins the Atlantic Ocean at a line drawn south from Cape Horn ChileArgentina to Antarctica and joins the Indian Ocean at a line drawn south from Tasmania Australia to Antarctica

As the Atlantic slowly gets wider the Pacific is slowly shrinking It does this by folding the sea floor in towards the center of the Earth  this is called subduction This bumping and grinding is hard so there are many earthquakes and volcanoes when the pressure builds up and is quickly put out into a big explosion of hot rocks and dust When an earthquake happens under the sea the quick jerk causes a tsunami This is why tsunamis are more common around the edge of the Pacific than anywhere else Many of the Earths volcanoes are either islands in the Pacific or are on continents within a few hundred kilometers of the oceans edge Plate tectoncis are another reason which makes Pacific Ocean smaller 

It is the largest Ocean on Earth

 Antarctica 

Antartica in relation to other continents The portion in red shows an area once claimed by Nazi Germany 

Antarctica is the Earths southernmost continent It lies on the South Pole It is almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle Around Antarctica is the Southern Ocean At 140 million km2 it is the fifth largest continent in area after Asia Africa North America and South America About 98 of Antarctica is covered by ice This ice averages at least 16 kilometers in thickness 

Antarctica on average is the coldest driest and windiest continent It is also the highest of all the continents Antarctica is considered a desert It has yearly precipitation of only 200 mm near the sea and far less inland No humans live in Antarctica permanently However about 1000 to 5000 people live through the year at the research stations in Antarctica Only plants and animals that can bear cold live there The animals include penguins seals nematodes Tardigrades and mites Plant life includes some grass and shrubs algae lichen fungi and bacteria

The first known sighting of the continent was in 1820 Antarctica was mostly forgotten for the rest of the 19th century This was because of its hostile environment few resources and isolation The first official use of the name Antarctica as a continental name in the 1890s is said to have been used by Scottish cartographer John George Bartholomew 

The Antarctic Treaty was signed in 1959 by 12 countries More countries have signed the treaty since then So far 46 countries have signed the treaty The treaty declares that military activities and mineral mining are against the law However it supports scientific research It also helps the continents ecozone More than 4000 scientists from different nations and different interests experiment together

Antarctica is covered by an ice sheet about four kilometres thick Under the ice it is mostly land except at places such as the Ross ice shelf which has no land underneath Antarctica has some important features hidden by the ice One is Lake Vostok which has been covered by ice for at least 15 million years The lake is 250 km long and 50 km wide Another is the huge Gamburtsev mountain chain which are the size of the Alps yet entirely buried under the ice

The only plants that grow on the land in Antarctica are mostly moss and lichen This is because Antarctica does not have much moisture sunlight good soil or a warm temperature Plants usually only grow for a few weeks in the summer The most important plant in Antarctica is the plankton that grows in the ocean

The largest land animal of Antarctica is the Midge It is very small compared to the other water animals but does seem like an insect but lots of animals that live in the sea may sometimes visit land The most important creature in the Arctic is the Krill because every animal eats it including whales penguins seals and even some of the birds that live in the Antarctic

Whales are the largest animals in the ocean and in Antarctica They are mammals not fish That means that they breathe air and do not lay eggs Many different kinds of whales live in the oceans around Antarctica The whales that eat krill do not have teeth Instead they have broken wikt linkbaleenbaleen in their mouths Baleen is long hard strips that act like a strainer The whale takes in a mouthful of water and it goes through the baleen Any krill in the water is trapped and swallowed while the water goes back out

Men have hunted whales for hundreds of years Whale meat is used for food Whales have a thick layer of fat or blubber that can be melted down to make oil The oils are used to light lamps

Penguins only live south of the equator Several different kinds live in and around Antarctica The biggest ones can stand nearly 4 feet tall and can weigh almost 100 pounds The smallest kinds are only about one foot tall Penguins are large birds that swim very well but cannot fly They have black backs and wings with white fronts They look rather like fat little men in suits as they broken wikt linkwaddlewaddle over the ice The penguins have a thick layer of blubber that keeps them warm Their feathers are very tightly packed and they are on top of each other to make another thick cover They also have a layer of woolly down under the feathers The feathers themselves are coated with a type of oil that makes them waterproof The penguins eat krill or fish and are at home in the ocean They come up on the land or ice to lay their eggs and raise the chicks The animals nest together in a huge group that is called a broken wikt linkrookeryrookery They usually make shallow nests on the ground out of rocks or mud

For a long time people had believed that there was a great continent in the far south of Earth They thought this Terra Australis would balance the lands in the north like Europe Asia and North Africa People have believed this from the times of Ptolemy He suggested this idea to keep the balance of all known lands in the world Pictures of a large land in the south were common in maps In the late 17th century people discovered that South America and Australia were not part of the mythical Antarctica However geographers still believed that Antarctica was much bigger than it really was

European maps continued to show this unknown land until Captain James Cooks ships HMS Resolution and Adventure crossed the Antarctic Circle on 17 January 1773 in December 1773 They crossed it again in January 1774 In fact Cook did come within about convert75mikm of the Antarctic coast However he was forced to go back because of ice in January 1773 The first confirmed sighting of Antarctica were by three different men According to different organizations ships captained by three men saw Antarctica in 1820 Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen Edward Bransfield and Nathaniel Palmer Von Bellingshausen saw Antarctica on 27 January 1820 This was three days before Bransfield saw land and ten months before Palmer did so in November 1820 On that day the two ship journey led by Von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev reached a point within 32 kilometers of the Antarctic broken wikt linkmainlandmainland and saw ice fields there The first recorded landing on mainland Antarctica was by the American sealer John Davis He landed in West Antarctica on 7 February 1821 However some historians are not sure about this claim

People began discovering different parts of Antarctica and mapping them This was slow work because they could only work in the summer At last a map was made and people began to talk about exploring the land not only the sea However this would have been very hard work They would have to break through the ice that was around Antarctica Then they would have to land on it and bring in enough things to live on while they explored the land

The first man to begin more serious exploration of the Antarctic land was a person named Robert Falcon Scott the most well known from all of the explorersHe wanted to be the very first man to reach the South Pole At the same time another team from Norway lead by Roald Amundsen had started They both raced each other to the North Pole but in the end Amundsen won because he had made a good use of the animals by using using sleigh dogs Scott had used ponies and motor sleds but he had not succeeded and when he got to the North Pole he was greeted by the message from Amundsen showing that he had beaten Scott

On his way back Scott and three companions met a blizzard and froze to death while waiting for it to finish The people who found him eight months later also found his records and diary which he had written to the day he died

People of the Antarctic live in there for a short time to learn more about Antarctica so most of the people who live there are scientists They study the weather animals glaciers and the air around our earthSome scientists broken wikt linkdrilldrill into the ice to find out about the weather long ago People who work in the Antarctic must be very careful because a blizzard can start any time and any where When they go far away from their shelter they must always take lots of food just in case

Today people explore Antarctica using snowmobiles which are faster than dogs and can pull heavier loads Many come to Antarctica just for a short visit as a trip There are companies in South America that have vacations to Antartica so people pay to take a ship down there Some people may just take their own boats

The South Pole is the most southern point on the Earth It is in Antarctica

In fact there are two main south poles One is fixed and one moves around

The Magnetic North and South Poles are where a magnetic compass points These poles move from year to year People can tell they are near these poles by looking at a compass From the South pole everywhere is North

The Geographic North and South poles are the poles the earth spins around the ones people see on a globe where all the northsouth lines meet These poles stay in the same place and are usually the ones we mean if we just say North or South Pole People can tell that they are at these poles by looking at the stars

Antarctica is a very cold place For many weeks in the middle of winter the sun never rises In the middle of summer late December through late March the sun never sets

At the pole itself there is a six month winter where the sun never rises Once the sun does come up it is the beginning of a six month summer where a person can stand there at any hour on the clock and observe the sun above the horizon appearing to slowly travel counter clockwise around him

The South Pole is hard to reach Unlike the North pole which is covered by the sea and flat sea ice the South Pole is on a mountainous continent This continent is called Antarctica It is covered by thick ice The south Pole is very high up and is very windy It is far from places where people live and ships going there often have to find their way through thick sea ice Once ashore land travelling explorers have to travel more than a thousand miles to get to the pole They must cross a floating ice shelf then up onto the ice covered land up steep mountain glaciers covered in broken twisted ice slowly sliding to the sea and across a high level land covered in ice and swept by strong freezing winds

Two expeditions in the early years of the century led by Robert Falcon Scott and then Ernest Shackleton failed to reach the South Pole but returned safely Shackleton turned back quite close to the pole but it was late in the season and supplies were low He knew that he would be risking the lives of his men to his credit he turned back

The first men to reach the South Pole were a group from Norway led by Roald Amundsen They arrived at the Pole on December 14 1911 and left the Norwegian flag Amundsen and his men returned home safely Amundsens story is one of excellent planning good leadership and willingness to learn from others this made extreme endurance unnecessary and perhaps made the successful expedition less of a story and therefore perhaps less famous than the next one

The most famous South Pole expedition is perhaps the one that failed badly This was the British expedition led by Robert Falcon Scott Scott and four other men dragging their equipment on sledges had hoped to be first to the Pole When they arrived there they saw a Norwegian flag A letter left for Scott showed that Amundsen and his men had beaten them by a month by using dogs to pull their sledges

On their journey back from the Pole Scotts team found that food dumps were short of supplies particularly kerosene Kerosene was very important not just for cooking but for melting ice Once it ran out they would have no water to drink One man collapsed and died while walking Oates knew his frostbitten feet could not carry him back to base and that he might delay his companions and risk their lives He committed suicide by walking out of their tent into the cold Scott and his remaining two companions died of starvation thirst and cold  trapped in the tent by bad weather until their supplies ran out Next spring the three bodies in the tent were found by a team from the main part of the expedition  who had spent the winter in the expeditionss hut by the sea Scotts letters to his wife written in the tent when he knew he was going to die have just been made public

Apart from Shackletons expedition to cross the Antarctic this was the end of the heroic age of exploration Motors Planes Radios and GPS ensured that following expeditions were never truly unsupported

Today there is an American science base at the South Pole It is named the Amundsen Scott South Pole Station to honor the two explorers

The Indian Ocean is the ocean surrounded by Asia to the north Australia and the Pacific Ocean to the east the Southern Ocean to the south and Africa and the Atlantic Ocean to the west It is so named because the river Indus from the native word Sindhu means ocean that empties out from the southern Asian country of Pakistan because its is located on its shore which was Ancient India The Bay of Bengal the Arabian Sea the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea are all parts of this ocean

The deepest point in the Indian Ocean is located in Java Trench it is 25344 feet deep The average depth is 13002 feet deep The Indian Ocean is 28350000 square miles in size

The Arctic Ocean is the ocean around the North Pole The most northern parts of Eurasia and North America are around the Arctic Ocean Thick pack ice and snow cover most of this ocean An icebreaker or a nuclear powered submarine can use the Arctic Ocean to go between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans

The oceans area is about 14056 million km2 which is the smallest of the worlds four oceans and it has convert45389kmmi0lkonabbroff of coastline The central surface covered by icepack about convert3mft1lkonabbroff in thickness The biology there is quite special Some endangered animals there include walruses whales and polar bears The Arctic ocean is melting quicker then usual as a result of global warming

The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is convert1038mft0abbroff The deepest point is in the Eurasian Basin at convert5450mft0abbron

The Inuit are one of many groups of First Nations who live in very cold places of northern Canada Greenland the Arctic and Alaska 

They are sometimes called Eskimos a word which likely comes from the Algonquin language and may mean eater of raw meat Some Inuit do not like to be called Eskimos but some do Inuit in Canada and Greenland like the name Inuit because it is a name they made Inuit means more than one one person is an Inuk The native Greenlanders are related to the Inuit The language of the Inuit is Inuktitut and it is one of the official languages of Nunavut and of the Northwest Territories in Canada

Eskimos did not have any wood to burn fires and that is why they ate raw meat The little bit of wood they rarely found was too important to burn and it had to be used for other things The only fire they had was blubber lamps These burned low and gave off only a little heat It took a long time to cook a meal over one So the Eskimos often ate their meat without cooking it

Eskimos were also nomads but they did not domesticate any animals except for dogs which they used to pull their sleds and help with the hunting They were huntergatherers living off whatever they found or killed They were very careful to make good use of every part of the animals they killed

Eskimos lived in tents made of animal skins during the summer In the winter they lived in sod houses and igloos They could build an igloo out of snow bricks in just a couple of hours Snow is full of air spaces which helps it hold in warmth With just a blubber lamp for heat an igloo could be warmer than the air outside The Eskimos made very clever things from the bones antlers and wood they had They invented the broken wikt linkharpoonharpoon which was used to hunt seals and whales They built boats from wood or bone covered with animal skins They invented the kayak for one man to use for hunting the ocean and among the pack ice

Eskimo sleds could be built from wood bone or even animal skins wrapped around frozen fish Dishes were made from carving soapstone bones or musk ox horns They wore two layers of skins one fur side in the other facing out to stay warm

Eskimos had to be good hunters to survive In the winter seals did not come out onto the ice They only came up for air at holes they chewed in the ice Eskimos would use their dogs to find the air holes then wait patiently until the seal came back to breathe and kill it with a broken wikt linkharpoonharpoon In the summer the seals would lie out on the ice enjoying the sun The hunter would have to slowly creep up on a seal to kill it

The Eskimos would use their dogs and spears to hunt polar bears musk ox and caribou Sometimes they would kill caribou from their boats as the animals crossed the rivers on their migration The Eskimos even hunted whales From their boat they would throw harpoons that were attached to floats made of broken wikt linkinflatedinflated seal skins The whale would grow tired from dragging the floats under the water When it slowed down and came up to the surface the Eskimos could keep hitting it with more harpoons or spears until it died

During the summer months the Eskimos were able to gather berries and roots to eat They also collected grass to line their boots or make baskets Often the food they found or killed during the summer was put into a cache for use during the long winter A cache was created by digging down to the permafrost and building a rock lined pit there The top would be covered with a pile of rocks to keep out the animals It was as good as a freezer because the food would stay frozen there until the family needed it Eskimos did not have a government or laws They learned early in life to help each other in order to survive They always shared food since it was often so hard to find They usually moved around in small groups looking for food and sometimes they would get together with other groups to hunt for larger animals such as whales The men did the hunting and home building and also made weapons sleds and boats The women cooked made the clothes and took care of the children

Today most Eskimos live in modern houses built by the government of their country Many still hunt or fish for some of their food and income They use rifles and broken wikt linksnowmobilesnowmobiles when they go They sell some of the fish they catch or the beautiful things they make for extra money In Alaska many of the people have received money from the oil discovered in that state However there are not many jobs for people in the Arctic Often they must have help from the government to survive The Arctic is very different from the rest of the world that the way of life in the south does not work well in the north

A basket is a container It is usually light

Basket makers use a wide variety of materials to create a basket such as bark willow rods leaves wire plastic paper and rope There are three basic kinds of baskets coiled twined or woven A woven basket is made of spokes and weavers the spokes run up and down and the weavers go over and under the spokes A coiled basket is made by sewing rings of a fibrous material to the previous ring Twined baskets have flexible weavers that are twined around the spokes in a variety of patterns 

Basketmaking is so old that it features in myths from various cultures Baskets are used to carry babies plants fruit cotton and Easter eggs Coroners once used a basket coffin to collect bodies thus the expression a basket case which meant the person was dead 

See also basketry 

  

In basketball the basket is an open net fixed to a metal ring in which players try to throw the ball

 Computer software is a type of computer program It means the applications and operating systems used with computers 

The term software was first used in the late 1960s to show the difference from computer hardware which are the fixed parts of a machine Before compact discs or Internet downloads software came on soft media like magnetic discs and magnetic tape

A container is an object used for holding something People put things in a container

South America is the continent to the south of North America These two continents are separated by the Panama Canal It is bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the east by the Atlantic Ocean

South America is attached to Central America at the boundary of Panama Geographically all of Panama including the part east of the Panama Canal in the isthmus is usually included in North America alone and among the countries of Central America This long continent is from the Caribbean Sea almost to Antarctica It separates the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans South America can be divided into four parts The Caribbean Republics include Colombia Venezuela Guyana Suriname and French Guiana The Andean Republics include Bolivia Chile Ecuador and Peru The River Plate Republics have Uruguay Paraguay and Argentina Brazil the largest country is a alone

The climate in most of South America is usually tropical It is humid tropical and tropical savanna in the north It is humid subtropical in the southeast Rainfall is different according to the places In some places it has zero inches but there are about 80 inches in the mountains Temperatures can also be very different The usual temperature in the mountains is 59 degrees while temperatures in the Tropics can be more than 100 degrees

The soil in Argentinas Pampas is among the best in the world Brazils soil is very good for growing coffee A great number of minerals have been found Few however have been mined Among those that were mined are iron manganese gold and gemstones The tropical forests are rich in valuable trees like mahogany ebony and rubber Oil is also a resource in some places

A bed is a piece of furniture that people sleep on It normally has sheets

Asia is the largest continent on Earth It is in the northern hemisphere Asia is connected to Europe in the west Together Asia and Europe are called Eurasia Some of the oldest human civilizations began in Asia such as Sumer China and India

The Asian continent is the largest of all continents Covering about 30 of the worlds land area it has more people than any other continent with about 60 of the worlds total population Stretching from the icy Arctic in the north to the hot and steamy equatorial lands in the south Asia contains huge empty deserts as well as some of the worlds highest mountains and longest rivers 

Asia is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea the Black Sea the Arctic Ocean the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean It is separated from Europe by the Pontic Mountains and the Turkish Straits A long mainly land border in the west separates Europe and Asia This line runs North South down the Ural Mountains in Russia along the Ural River to the Caspian Sea and through the Caucasus Mountains to the Black Sea Worlds most intelligent people are from Asia

Some European countries are also partly in Asia About three quarters of Russia is in Asia while the rest is in Europe Small parts of four other Asian countries are in Europe 

A wall is a vertical dividing surface It divides space in buildings into rooms or protects buildings It is usually made of stone or brick Walls have 2 main purposes to support the top part of buildings and to divide space giving protection from invasion and weather

Before artillery was invented many cities in Europe had protective walls Since they are not suitable for defense any more the walls have been destroyed

The term the Wall usually referred to the Berlin Wall built during the Cold War which fell in 1989

Coordinated Universal Time is the standard time zone of the world The standard before was Greenwich Mean Time UTC and GMT are almost the same It is also called civil time and Zulu time

Some websites like Wikipedia use UTC because it does not make any country look more important than the others It offers one time for all the internet 

Timezones are often named by how many hours they are different from UTC time For example UTC 5 is 5 hours behind UTC If the time is 0700 UTC the local time is 0200 in New York and 1000 in Moscow

0700 UTC is also written more simply as 0700Z

Note that UTC uses the 24 hour clock That means there is no AM or PM For example 400PM would be 1600 or 1600

A television is a machine with a screen Televisions receive broadcast signals and turn them into pictures and sound The word television comes from the words tele and vision

Sometimes a TV can look like a box Older TVs had large wooden frames and sat on the floor like furniture Newer TVs are much lighter and flatter A television can show pictures from many places At first all televisions used an antenna This would pick up shows from broadcast television stations A TV station could be many miles away and still be picked up TVs can also show movies from VCD and DVD players or VCRs Cable TV and Satellite TV can provide more programs at once than broadcast can Video game consoles connect to most modern TVs Some computers can also use a TV as a monitor

All TVs have screens where the picture is viewed Before the 1970s these were usually black and white which made everything look grey but all modern TVs show colors Screens also used to have rounded corners but now they are usually flat rectangles with straight edges It is a wider rectangle that looks more like the shape of a movie theatre screen This is called widescreen If a widescreen set was 30 cm tall it would be 53 cm wide For this to work best TV shows also need to be made in widescreen Widescreen sets can still be any size but they have the same widescreen shape

All TVs used to be made with cathode ray tubes These are like heavy glass jars with one side facing out to form the screen Today there are also Liquid crystal display Plasma rear projection and organic light emitting diode TVs

Sociology is the study of societies and how humans act in groups Sociology is a social science People who study sociology are called sociologists

Auguste Comte was first to use the term The problems caused by the change to an industrial society where many people moved to cities and worked in factories was an early focus of sociology Karl Marx Max Weber and mile Durkheim were leading figures in the study of social phenomena Themes included community authority status alienation and lack of power 

In the 2000s sociology looks at such things as race ethnicity class gender the family and social interaction It also studies the breakdown of social structures crime and divorce Sociology can also be looked at as the study of the worldwide society A society is the community of people living in a particular country or region and having shared customs laws and organizations

Sociologists research the structures that organize society such as race gender and social classes They study the family and examine problems such as crime and drug abuse 

Most sociologists work in one or more specialty areas or sub fields Sociology includes many sub fields that examine different aspects of society For example social stratification studies inequality and class structure in society The field of demography studies changes in a population size or type The field of criminology examines criminal behavior and crime Political sociology studies government and laws Sociology of race and sociology of gender examine how people think about race and gender 

Many sociologists also do research outside of the university Their research helps teachers lawmakers and government administrators to make better institutions government programs and rules

Sociologists often use statistics to count and measure patterns in how people act or behave Sociologists also interview people or hold group discussions to find out why people behave in certain ways Some sociologists combine different research methods

Social analysis has been done since the time of Plato Sociology became a type of science in the early 1800s European cities were changing as many people moved into cities and began working in factories Sociologists tried to understand how people interacted and how groups interacted

The word sociology was invented by a French thinker called Auguste Comte in 1838 Early thinkers who wrote about sociology included Karl Marx and Max Weber 

Sociology was taught in a university for the first time at the University of Kansas in 1890 The first European department of sociology was founded in 1895 at the University of Bordeaux by mile Durkheim The first sociology department to be established in Britain was at the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1904 In 1919 a sociology department was established in Germany at the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich by Max Weber

The sky is what we call the appearance of a hemisphere over our heads On a clear day it appears blue The deepness of the blue increases as we move from the horizon to the point above our head 

The sky which is made up of gas molecules is blue because of the random scattering of sunlight by the molecules Rayleigh scattering defines the amount of scattering of light rays Since all colors of the rainbow create a white light we should see a white sky but blue light scatters much more than red That is why the sky appears blue

In a tone language different tones will change the meaning of the words even if the pronunciation of the word is the same otherwise English and almost all other European languages are not tone languages at all

Many East Asian languages are tone languages such as all the Chinese languages Vietnamese a small number of Korean dialects 

In some languages pitch accent is important That means a words meaning could be different depending on which syllable is stressed Examples include Swedish Norwegian Serbo Croatian and Lithuanian Japanese has a similar system

An example of tone language in Mandarin ma ma ma ma mean four different things If we include numbers that mean the tones it can be written like ma2 ma1 ma4 ma3 which means the hemps mother scolds the horse Some Romanizations write each tone with a different spelling so ma2 ma1 ma4 ma3 would be ma mha mah maa in Gwoyeu Romatzyh Romanization Most use numbers or accent marks

Some tones may sound alike to people who do not speak a tone language and are easy to forget So tone is the most difficult part of learning a tone language for many people

A dollar is a type of currency Many countries have named their money the dollar so in an encyclopaedia article it is important to say which country the dollar is from that is being talked about for example the United States dollar or the Canadian dollar The symbol for the dollar is a capital letter S pierced by one or two vertical lines 

The dollar is named after the thaler The thaler was large silver coin first made in the year 1518 The thaler named after the Joachimsthal mine located in Bohemia

Beer is an alcoholic drink It is made with water hops barley and yeast A process called fermentation turns sugar into alchool using yeast Another product of the fermentation is carbon dioxide 

In general all alcoholic drinks where yeast turns sugar into alcohol are called beer In these cases destillation is not used The different to wine is that with wine sugars from plants such as fruit sugar or that made by animals is used As an example mead is a wine made from honey Japanese sake is made from rice and uses yeast for fermentation so even if some people call it rice wine sake is really a kind of beer

The act of making beer is called brewing Beer is made by adding warm water to malted barley and other grains The enzymes in the barley change the malted barley and other grains into simple sugars This is called the mash The water is then sparged from the grain The water is now called wort The wort is boiled and hops are added Hops provide flavour and preserve the beer After boiling the wort is cooled and yeast is added The yeast turns the sugars into alcohol and the wort into beer

Different beers can have different natures depending on the ingredients used for example an ale uses top fermenting yeast Top fermenting yeasts eat more sugar and produce more alcohol A lager uses bottom fermenting yeast Bottom fermenting yeasts eat less sugar and produce a crisper cleaner taste Adding hops makes the beer more bitter and aromatic Specialty malts produce different flavours and colours These flavours and colours are most notable in dark beers like Porter and Stout

Different countries have different ways to make beer In Germany Austria Switzerland Czech Republic and Slovakia beer is usually made from just hops malt water and yeast This is because of the Reinheitsgebot The Reinheitsgebot was a law that said says that beer can only be made from hops malt and water Yeast was discovered after the Reinheitsgebot The law was overturned by the European Union in 1992 In Belgium however beers are also have always been made with wheat sugar fruit and other ingredients

The type of yeast used determines the kind of beer made

The earliest records of beer were written around 7000 years ago by the Sumerians It is said that the Sumerians discovered the fermentation process by accident It is not known exactly how this happened but it could be that a piece of bread or grain became wet and a short time later it began to ferment and made a pulp that caused people to become drunk A seal around 4000 years old is a Sumerian Hymn to Ninkasi the goddess of brewing This hymn is also a recipe for making beer A description of the making of beer on this ancient engraving in the Sumerian language is the earliest account of what is easily recognised as barley followed by a pictograph of bread being baked crumbled into water to form a mash and then made into a drink that is recorded as having made people feel wonderful and blissful It could even be possible that bread was first baked to be a way to make beer that is easy to carry around The Sumerians were probably the first people to brew beer They had found a divine drink  they felt it was a gift from the gods

Normal beers have around 4 6 alcohol In brewing beer the amount of alcohol can be made more or less quite easily The Belgian types of beer are made by adding more sugar Through the fermentation this will then turn to alcohol Today there are beers with between 2 and about 16 of alcohol Some beer labels say there is no alcohol in them because it was taken out later This is not completely true though Beers without alcohol usually do have less than 1 of alcohol

Eurasia is a continent in the northern part of the Earth Eurasia is made of Europe and Asia which are on the same tectonic plate and do not have a sea between them so they are scientifically one continent The word is made by adding Eur to Asia to make Eurasia

Some geographers say its all just one continent because unlike the Americas or Africa Europe and Asia are not divided by sea The Ancient Greeks divided the world they knew into Europe Asia and Africa  Since then people have been talking about Asia and Europe as two continents so it is now a tradition   

Some other continents are not completely divided by sea and are joined together and by a thin strip of land like North America and South America However Europe and Asia are not divided by sea at all

Sometimes Eurasia is divided into West Eurasia and East Eurasia West Eurasia is Europe and the Middle East Historians sometimes add North Africa to West Eurasia because the Sahara Desert divides North Africa from the other parts of Africa and it is as difficult to cross as a sea

The North Pole is the point that is farthest north on the planet Earth It is the point on which axis of Earth turns It is in the Arctic Ocean and its cold there because the sun does not shine there for about half a year The ocean around the pole is always very cold and it is covered by a thick sheet of ice 

There is also a Magnetic North Pole It is near the above North Pole A compass points toward the magnetic North Pole

There is a star called the North Star or the Pole Star that always appears in the sky above the North Pole For hundreds of years sailors were able to tell how far north they were by seeing how high the North Star appeared in the sky

Plural is a form of the noun that shows that there are more than one The opposite of the plural is the singular which means there is only one 

In some languages a suffix is added to a word to show that the word means many For example English usually uses s to mark the plural For example cat is singular but cats is plural 

All European languages have plurals Some languages also have duals like Arabic ancient Hebrew and Inuktitut Other languages even have

These different numbers will have different suffixes from the plural suffix

Some languages do not have plural endings at all Some of these are the East Asian languages of Chinese Korean and Japanese So native speakers of these languages can easily forget to use plurals

Alexander Gottfried Friedrich Gode von Aesch or simply Alexander Gode a German American linguist and translator He helped create Interlingua

Oceania is a name used in geography for the continent made up by Australia New Zealand New Guinea and several other island nations in the surrounding area Some people call this part of the world Australasia instead

Sometimes people use the name Oceania to include only the Polynesian and Melanesian islands in the Pacific Ocean as separate from Australasia

The Southern Ocean is the ocean around Antarctica It was a new term in geography officially created in 2000 It means the waters of the Atlantic Pacific and Indian Oceans around the continent of Antarctica out to sixty degrees south latitude Some people call this ocean the Antarctic Ocean

The total area is 20327000 km and the coastline length is 17968 km

The Catalan language is a Romance language spoken in Catalonia Valencia the eastern part of Aragon the Balearic Islands a small zone of Murcia Andorra North Catalonia and in the Italian city of LAlguer These places are often called the Catalan Countries 

The language most like Catalan is Occitan It is also a bit similar to Spanish Italian French and Portuguese

Australasia was the name of the joint team of Australia and New Zealand in the 1908 London and 1912 Stockholm Olympic Games

Pop music is commonly defined as popular music listened to purchased nominated for special events Styles of pop music in the 2010s include rock music electronic dance music and hip hop

There are also many more people working on pop music who are not seen on the stage or in the video These people include the studio staff production staff distribution staff and retail staff 

Tour staff help the band to travel around the country for their concert tours Some tour staff help by carrying heavy musical instruments onto the stage Other tour staff drive buses or cars so that the band can get to the concert Some tour staff operate sound equipment such as the large amplifiers and loudspeakers that are used to amplify the bands music for the audience

Promotional staff help to market or promote the bands music so that more people will know about the band and buy the bands CDs Some promotional staff travel to radio stations and give the bands CD to radio station managers or DJs Other promotional staff write press releases about the band which are sent to newspapers

Pop music came from the Rock and Roll movement of the early 1950s when record companies recorded songs that they thought that teenagers would like Pop music usually uses musical from the other types of music that are popular at the time Many different styles of music have become pop music during different time periods Often music companies create pop music styles by taking a style of music that only a small number of people were listening to and then making that music more popular by marketing it to teenagers and young adults 

In the 1950s recording companies took blues influenced rock and roll and rockabilly and promoted them as pop music In the late 1960s and early 1970s record companies took folk music bands and musicians and helped them to create a new type of music called folk rock or acid rock Folk rock and acid rock mixed folk music blues and rock and roll In the 1970s record companies created several harder louder type of blues called blues rock or heavy metal which became a type of pop music

In the late 1970s and early 1980s a type of nightclub dance music called Disco turned into a popular type of pop music Record companies took an experimental strange sounding type of music called New Wave music from the 1980s and turned it into pop music bands such as The Cars In the 1990s record companies took an underground type of hard rock called Grunge Michael Jackson was also a very influencial artist for pop music His album Thriller is the best selling album of all time He also wrote some other very influential songs such as Bad Give in to Me Will You Be There Heal the World We Are the World Black or White and Billie Jean just to name a few

General semantics is a philosophy that deals with how people react to things that happen around them based on meaning It was created by Alfred Korzybski during the 1920s and early 1930s 

The goal of general semantics is for people to know that when we simplify something either mentally or in language that simplification is not the same thing as the thing simplified How people understand reality is not the same as what reality is because people do not know everything about reality General semantics teaches that there is always more to something than what is seen heard felt or believed 

Semiotics is a theoretical framework for the study of the meaning of language signs and symbols It was first developed in the early 20th century separately by the Swiss Ferdinand Saussure and Charles Sanders Peirce of the USA It can be described as both a science and a technique a science because it has its own theories and a technique because it is a way of studying systems of representation and meaning

Semiotics is usually divided into three parts

The major branches of semiotics include

Nitrogen is a nonmetal chemical element It has the chemical symbol N and atomic number 7 Its stable nuclei typically contains 14 nucleons It has 5 electrons in its outermost shell 

Nitrogen is a colorless odorless gas at normal temperature It is normally bonded to another nitrogen atom making a nitrogen molecule The bond is very strong That is why many explosives contain nitrogen The bond is broken when the explosive is made When it explodes the bond forms releasing a lot of energy

It turns into a liquid at 1958C and turns into a solid at 210C If it is compressed it can be turned into a liquid without making it cold 

It is very unreactive because of its strong bond The bond prevents it from reacting Lithium is one of the only chemical elements that react with nitrogen without being heated Magnesium can burn in nitrogen Nitrogen also makes blue electric sparks The blue color is caused by the atoms being excited When they get normal again they release light When nitrogen is excited it reacts with many things that it does not normally react with

Air is made up of about 78 nitrogen and about 22 oxygen It is also in a few nitrates in the ground Ammonium minerals are rare Nitrogen is in proteins

Pure liquid nitrogen can be made by cooling air The nitrogen turns into a liquid at a different temperature than the oxygen It can also be made by heating certain chemical compounds such as sodium azide

Nitrogen as an element is used to prevent things from reacting with the oxygen in the air It can be used to fill chip bags and incandescent bulbs It is also used to fill some tires It can be used to make electric components like transistors Liquid nitrogen can be used to freeze things 

Nitrogen compounds have many uses such as anesthetics explosives cleaners and meat

Nitrogen was discovered by Daniel Rutherford in 1772 who called it noxious gas or fixed gas They discovered that part of air did not burn It was found that animals died in it It was known as azote Many nitrogen compounds also contain the azide or azine letters such as hydrazine

In 1910 Lord Rayleigh found out that when a spark was passed through nitrogen it made a reactive form of nitrogen This nitrogen reacted with many metals and compounds 

Nitrogen is not poisonous We can safely breathe it when it is a part of air but we cannot breathe pure nitrogen by itself because it does not have the oxygen that we need to live Someone that breaths in pure nitrogen will just fall asleep and die 

Association football is a sport played between two teams It is usually called football but in some countries such as the United States it is called soccer In Japan New Zealand South Africa Australia Canada and Republic of Ireland both words are commonly used

Each team has 11 players on the field One of these players is the goalkeeper and the other ten are known as outfield players The game is played by kicking a ball into the opponents goal A match has 90 minutes of play with a break of 15 minutes in the middle The break in the middle is called half time

There are many competitions for football for both football clubs and countries Football clubs usually play other teams in their own country with a few exceptions Cardiff City FC from Wales for example play in the English leagues and in the English FA Cup

Groups such as UEFA and FIFA organise international competitions between clubs and countries Clubs play in competitions such as UEFA Champions League or UEFA Europa League and countries play for the World Cup or a continental trophy such as the UEFA European Championship

The FIFA World Cup takes place every four years between national teams and is the worlds most popular sporting event even more popular than the Olympic Games In football there are two main types of competitions In a league all of the teams play the same number of games but in a cup teams leave the competition when they lose until the last two teams play each other to decide the winner

If a game is tied after 90 minutes the game will continue onto extra time Extra time may be up to 30 minutes maximum before a penalty shootout occurs

Football is the worlds most popular sport It is played in more countries than any other game In fact FIFA has more members than the United Nations It is played by both males and females

In Europe the main competitions to compete to be the best in Europe are the Champions League for the top teams from the top leagues in each country in Europe Then there is UEFA Europa League which is for the next best teams from each member of the UEFA

The most successful club in the world is Rangers FC from Scotland who have won more major titles than any other team in the world They have won the countrys league 51 times which is a world record Other successful clubs are Real Madrid and FC Barcelona from Spain Palmeiras from Brazil or Manchester United FC from England

Spamming is when one person or company sends an unwanted email to another person  Spam emails are the computer version of unwanted junk mail that arrives in a mailbox such as advertising pamphlets and brochures Spam emails are usually sent to try to get the person to buy something or do something else that will cause gain for the sender

The emails sent when someone is spamming is called spam The person or company who sent the unwanted email is called a spammer

Spam emails are often sent to many people at once trying to get them to buy a product or sign up for a service The people who receive the email did not ask to receive the email and do not want to receive it

One of the reasons there is so much spam emails around is that it costs very little to send millions of spam messages at once Spam messages can easily be sent sometimes even by a special computer program 

The hardest part about spamming is to get the email addresses to send the spam to Sometimes the spammers do this by searching for emails on the internet or by buying emails from people who know a lot of them 

One part of getting e mail addresses is to find addresses that are still in use One trick used by spammers is to put a link at the end of a message like this

If the person clicks on the link it tells the spammers that there is someone at the address Then the spammers put that person on a list of people who actually read spam messages Next the spammers sell that list to other spammers The same thing happens if the person sends another email back to the spammer which also tells the spammer the message has been read

Another trick that spammers use is to put a picture even one that cannot be seen into a spam message The picture will have a name that goes with just that one email When the email is opened a request will be sent to the server that has that picture to get the image If they get this request then they know that you read their email which could cause a person to receive even more spam email

The word spamming is also used to describe the act of typing a lot of words or text in Internet chatrooms so that other people using the chatroom cannot carry on conversations Spamming in Internet chatrooms is usually considered to be rude

The word spam is often applied to emails containing content that the receiver sees as silly or simply meaningless

Computer users at home and in workplaces waste a lot of time opening and deleting spam messages In some cases spam emails contain viruses or links to pornography or illegal gambling websites Spam emails often advertise products or services which are being lied about by the companies sending the spam such as frauds or scams

An earthquake is a violent movement of the rocks in the Earths crust Earthquakes are usually quite brief but may repeat over a long period of time 

They are the result of a sudden release of energy in the Earths crust which creates seismic waves waves of energy that travel through the Earth The seismicity or seismic activity of an area refers to the frequency type and size of earthquakes over a period of time 

There are large earthquakes and small earthquakes Big earthquakes can take down buildings and cause death and injury The study of earthquakes is called seismology

When the earth moves offshore in the ocean it can cause a tsunami A tsunami can cause just as much death and destruction as an earthquake Landslides can happen too This is an important part of the Earths cycle

Earthquakes are measured using observations from seismometers The magnitude of an earthquake and the intensity of shaking is measured on a numerical scale On the scale 3 or less is scarcely noticeable and magnitude 7 causes damage over a wide area

The ancient Chinese also used a device that looked like a jar with dragons on the top surrounded by frogs with their mouths open When an earthquake occurred a ball fitted into each dragons mouth would drop out of the dragons mouth into the frogs The position of the frog which received a ball indicated the direction of the earthquake

Earthquakes are caused by tectonic movements in the Earths crust The main cause is that when tectonic plates collide one rides over the other causing orogeny earthquakes and volcanoes 

The boundaries between moving plates form the largest fault surfaces on Earth When they stick relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress This continues until the stress rises and breaks suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault releasing the stored energy

There are three main types of fault that may cause an earthquake normal reverse and strike slip Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened Strike slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other

Most earthquakes form part of a sequence related to each other in terms of location and time Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors which cause little to no damage but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern

An aftershock is an earthquake that occurs after a previous earthquake the mainshock An aftershock is in the same region of the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude Aftershocks are formed as the crust adjusts to the effects of the main shock

Earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period of time They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is obviously the main shock therefore none have notable higher magnitudes than the other An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at Yellowstone National Park

Sometimes a series of earthquakes occur in a sort of earthquake storm where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes Similar to aftershocks but on adjacent segments of fault these storms occur over the course of years and with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones Such a pattern occurred in Turkey in the 20th century

Tsunami or a chain of fast moving waves in the ocean caused by powerful earthquakes is a very serious challenge for peoples safety and for earthquake engineering Those waves can inundate coastal areas destroy houses and even swipe away whole towns

Unfortunately tsunami can not be prevented However there are warning systems which may warn the population before the big waves reach the land to let them enough time to rush to safety

Some countries such as Japan or parts of a country like California in the United States have a lot of earthquakes In these places it is a good practice to build houses and other buildings so they will not collapse when there is an earthquake This is called seismic design or earthquake proofing

For many years earthquakes have occurred That is why there are earthquake proof buildings The ability of a building to withstand the stress of an earthquake depends upon its type of construction shape mass distribution and rigidity Different combinations are used Different shapes of buildings such as square rectangular and shell buildings can withstand earthquakes far better than skyscrapers To reduce stress a buildings ground floor can be supported by extremely rigid hollow columns while the rest of the building is supported by flexible columns located inside the hollow columns A different method is to use rollers or rubber pads to separate the base columns from the ground allowing the columns to shake parallel during an earthquake

To help prevent a roof from collapsing builders make the roof out of light weight materials Outdoor walls can be made with stronger and more reinforced materials such as steel or reinforced concrete During an earthquake flexible windows may help hold the windows together so they dont break

Scurvy is a disease It is caused by not eating enough Vitamin C 

People who have scurvy get spots on their skin especially the legs Their teeth may become loose and fall out They may bleed from the mouth nose and gums A person with scurvy will look pale They will feel sad They will not be able to move easily because their joints hurt

In the past sailors used to get scurvy because fresh fruit and meat could not be kept for as long as they were at sea Almost nobody gets scurvy now in rich countries

At first a person with scurvy may

A bit later a person with scurvy may

When a person gets help for scurvy they usually get better very quickly Babies start eating again after one or two days of help The symptoms get better within seven days

Eating vitamin C prevents scurvy How much vitamin C a person needs changes with his or her age and is different for pregnant and lactating women The following is the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences National Research Councils advice on how much vitamin C to eat every day

Foods with a lot of vitamin C include the following

An ion is part of an atom or part of a group of atoms It is charged so it will move near electricity This is because atoms are made of three smaller parts neutrons and equal numbers of charged protons and oppositely charged electrons An ion has unequal numbers of protons and electrons Making an ion from an atom or molecule is called ionization

The charge on a proton is measured as 1 and the charge on an electron is measured as 1 An atom that is ionized makes two ions one positive and one negatively charged For example a neutral hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron Heating the atom breaks it into two parts a positively charged hydrogen ion H a negatively charged electron

A liquid with ions is called an electrolyte A gas with lots of ions is called a plasma When ions move it is called electricity For example in a wire the metal ions do not move but the electrons move as electricity A positive ion and a negative ion will move together Two ions of the same charge will move apart When ions move they also make magnetic fields

In chemistry a molecule or atom that is electrically charged is called an ion An ion has more or less electrons than there are protons in an atom The process of giving or taking electrons away from a normal atom and turning it into an ion is called ionization 

Many ions are colourless Elements in the main groups in the Periodic Table form colourless ions Some ions are coloured The transition metals usually form coloured ions 

In physics atomic nuclei that have been completely ionized are called charged particles These are ones in alpha radiation

Ionization happens by giving atoms high energy This is done using electrical voltage or by high energy radiation 

An ionized gas is called plasma

A simple ion is formed from a single atom

Polyatomic ions are formed from a lot of atoms Polyatomic ions usually consist of all non metal atoms but sometimes the polyatomic ion can have a metallic atom too

Positive ions are called cations They are attracted to cathodes All simple metal ions are cations

Negative ions are called anions They are attracted to anodes All simple non metal ions are anions 

Transition metals can form more than one simple cation with different charges

Most ions have a charge of less than 4 but some can have higher charges

Michael Faraday was the first person to write a theory about ions He did this in 1830 In his theory he said what the portions of molecules were like that moved to anions or cations Svante August Arrhenius said how this happened He wrote this in his doctoral dissertation in 1884 Arrhenius was studying at the University of Uppsala The university did not accept his theory at first But in 1903 he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1903 for the same idea

In Greek ion is like the word go Anion and cation mean up goer and down goer Anode and cathode are way up and way down

In Greek mythology Ion was a son of Xuthus and Creusa He founded the Ionian race and became a king of Athens The term is also used for an element of the Plato texts and a Window manager

Anthropology is the study of human beings Anthropology is a biological and historical social science that helps us learn how groups of people are the same and how they are different in all parts of the world Anthropologists do research in many places and study how people live now and how they may have lived in the past They research in modern cities small villages tribes and in the countryside They study how groups of people consider time space life etc

Applied anthropology is a type of anthropology that uses information discovered using science to help people One recent use of applied anthropology is the return of ancient ways of successful farming to people living in South America Another use of applied anthropology is the learning of languages close to dying out and the teaching of young people the language of their ancestors

The four big kinds of anthropology are

Most people who study anthropology have some schoolwork in all four big kinds of anthropology but later study one or two areas primarily

Defense or defence is protecting something from attack

A countrys government may form an army a navy andor an air force to protect the country and its people from attacks The army navy and air force can also be used to attack other countries A country can also use the military to kill or arrest people or members of groups from other countries who have hurt or killed their own citizens

In these groups people are specially trained to use weapons such as rifles and artillery that can be used to kill other soldiers and destroy their equipment Together these groups form a countrys military Some governments like the United States government spend large amounts of money every year to buy and keep weapons and to pay people to defend their countries These trained people are called soldiers

A countrys armed forces can also be used for non military jobs such as delivering food aid to hungry people filling sandbags during a flood bringing doctors and nurses to poor people in foreign countries to help them when they are sick or helping put out forest fires

Sometimes when a countrys army is doing a lot of work in different places and there are not enough soldiers to do more work a country can hire civilians who are not members of the military to do some of the armys jobs like protecting buildings important people and groups of trucks travelling from one place to another This lets the country to use their military for other jobs Usually these people hired by a country this way used to be members of the military before leaving and working for other people companies and countries

In legal matters the defense is the person or people who are charged with a crime in a court case along with their lawyer The arguments and evidence that they provide to prove they did not commit the crime is also called their defense

Education is about teaching and learning skills and knowledge Education also means helping people to learn how to do things and encouraging them to think about what they learn It is also important for educators to teach ways to find and use information

Through education the knowledge of society country and of the world is passed on from generation to generation In democracies through education children and adults are supposed to learn how to be active and effective citizens

It is part of the job of an educator an instructor teacher or tutor to create a place for learning There are many different kinds of education

Formal education is usually in school where a person may learn basic academic or trade skills Formal education begins in elementary school and continues with secondary school Post secondary education is usually at a college or university

Nonformal education is sometimes called adult basic education adult literacy education or school equivalency preparation In nonformal education an adult can learn literacy other basic skills or job skills Nonformal education can be in small classes or through self study

There is also informal education For example a parent teaches a child how to prepare a meal Someone can also get an informal education by reading many books from a library Informal education is when you are not studying in a school and do not use another particular learning method

Public schools provide a free education through the government Parents are free to let their children receive private education but they must pay for it In some poorer places some children cannot go to school because their countries do not make education available in their countries because their families do not have enough money or because the children have to work hard to earn the money

The army is the part of a countrys military that fights on the ground People in the army are called soldiers Many modern armies have vehicles such as tanks airplanes and helicopters to help soldiers fight on the ground

A soldier may be a volunteer or he may be drafted Forcing men to join the army is called conscription or draft Voluntary armies tend to be small by numbers but high in confidence and quality Drafted armies are large but often lacking in confidence and in quality it may be very difficult to force someone to risk his life against his will

A soldier does many things from shooting enemies to using binoculars to find out where enemies are They are used to defend their country or attack another countrys army It is difficult and a soldier must be in good shape both physically and mentally They almost always move together and that way the team can do more things in a safer way They may be assigned to certain places to guard or they may be told to search a place or even attack it That is up to their commander Every soldier answers to someone else so that way everything is organized

A soldier is supplied with weapons such as guns knives and other simple gear for surviving in the battlefield such as food water clothes and tents They must keep good care of the items

Before a soldier joins the army he must qualify to be in it first The person is put through tests so that the army will know if the recruit can do it or not This is sometimes called boot camp He must complete mental tests and physical tests It depends on where he is testing that will tell him how hard it will be He will also take tests to determine what job he will do in the military For instance he may work with computers or be a cook for the soldiers or he may be very good with a rifle and be a sniper There are a lot of jobs that a person can choose to do in the army

Theology is the study of one or more religions Somebody who studies theology is called a theologian

Theology may be studied for many reasons Some study theology to better understand their own religion while others study theology so that they can compare religions

The word theology was first used to describe the study of the Christian God but some now use it to describe the study of religion generally but not everyone agrees that it is right to do so Some people use the words comparative theology when they want to mean discussing the theology of more than one religion at once

Work can mean different things depending on how the word is used

Romania is a country in the Central Europe It is north of the Balkan Peninsula on the Lower Danube River Part of Romania is circled by the Carpathian Mountains It also has a border on the Black Sea Most of the Danube Delta is found inside Romania Romania shares borders with Hungary and Serbia to the west Ukraine to the far northeast the Republic of Moldova to the near northeast and Bulgaria to the south

Romania is a semi presidential unitary state It was created when Moldavia and Wallachia joined together in 1859 It was given its independence in the Treaty of Berlin of 1878 At the end of World War II some of its land was occupied by the USSR After the Iron Curtain fell in 1989 During the 2000s Romania made changes to the country such as reform the democratic system human rights acts freedom of speech acts economy and law That let Romania join the European Union on January 1 2007

Romania has the 9th biggest area of land and the 7th biggest population of the European Union member states The capital and biggest city in Romania is Bucharest with a population of 19 million One of the cities in Transylvania Sibiu was named a European Capital of Culture Romania joined NATO on March 29 2004

The word Romania comes from the Romanian word Romn which comes from the Latin word Romanus which means Roman English texts still used the word Rumania during World War II This came from the French word Roumanie

Some of the oldest human remains found in Europe were discovered in Romania They were about 42000 years old This may have been when the first Homo sapiens came to Europe

The worlds first and oldest writing comes from people who lived in todays Romania Approximately 5300 years BC According to archaeologys it is not a matter of symbols but the worlds first writings But the people they were is still uncertain 

Herodotus in the fourth book of The Histories written in about 440 BCE Herodotus wrote that the Getae were defeated by the Persian Emperor Darius the Great when he battled the Scythians The Getae were called the Dacians by the Romans They were Thracians who were living in Dacia which is where Romania Moldova and the northern part of Bulgaria are now The Dacians attacked the Roman province the border of which was formed by the Danube in 87 CE This was during Emperor Domitians rule The Dacians were defeated by the Roman Empire under Emperor Trajan in two battles that lasted from 101 CE until 106 CE The Roman Empire made Dacia into the province of Roman Dacia

A lot of ore such as gold and silver were found in Roman Dacia A lot of gold and silver were found in the Western Carpathians Trajan went back to Rome with 165 tons of gold and 330 tons of silver after his broken wikt linkconquestconquest

There were many Romans living in the province of Roman Dacia They spoke Vulgar Latin They began to write the local languages using the Latin alphabet Writing languages with the Latin alphabet is called romanization This became the first version of Romanian

In the 3rd century the province was attacked by groups of nomadic people like the Goths They made the Roman Empire leave Dacia about 271 CE This became the Roman Empires first abandoned province 

The origin of modern Romanians is widely talked about by historians to this day It is thought that the Romanians were formed from big ethnic groups that came from both the south and north parts of the Danube

From 271 to 275 the Goths took over the abandoned Roman province They lived in Dacia until the 4th century when another group of wandering peoples the Huns came to Dacia The Gepids Avars with the Slavic people were in control of Transylvania through the 8th century In the 8th century however the country was taken over by the Hungarian Empire It was made part of the First Bulgarian Empire which ended Romanias Dark Ages

The Bulgarians held Transylvania until the 11th century The Pechenegs the Cumans and the Uzes were a few of the people later noted in the history of Romania

In 1310 now called the High Middle Ages Basarab I started the Romanian principality of Wallachia Moldavia was begun by Drago around 1352 During the Middle Ages Romanians were living in three different areas Wallachia Moldavia and Transylvania 

Transylvania belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary from around the 10th century until the 16th century when it turned into the Principality of Transylvania This lasted until 1711 Wallachia had been on the border of the Ottoman Empire since the 14th century As the Ottoman Empires influence grew it gradually fell under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century 

The best known ruler of this period was Vlad III the Impaler also known as Vlad Dracula or Vlad epe tsepe Prince of Wallachia during the years of 1448 145662 and 1476 While he was the leader of his people he had an agreement with the Ottoman Empire to stay independent Many people in Romania during this time thought of him as a ruler with a great sense of justice and defense for his country

Moldavia was at its greatest when Stephen the Great was ruling between 1457 and 1504 He was a great military leader winning 47 battles and losing only 2 After every battle he won Stephen would build a church Because he won 47 of the battles that he fought he ended up building 48 churches After Stephen the Greats death Moldavia came under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire during the 16th century

When the Austro Hungarian Empire was in control of Transylvania and the Ottoman Empire was in control of Wallachia and Moldavia almost all of the Romanians were second class citizens or non citizens They stayed this way even when they made up most of the people in those areas

After Wallachian Revolution of 1821 as in the 1830s was addressed nationalists thoughts and feelings into Romania and became called National awakening of Romania Even then adopted a 3 colored flag blue yellow red which was later to become a Flag of Romania

After the even more violent Revolution of 1848 did not succeed so explained the Great Powers did not like the idea of Romania becoming a free nation 

The people who voted in 1859 in Moldavia and Wallachia picked the same person Alexandru Ioan Cuza to be the prince in those areas He managed to unite the people and nationalism was seen as a useful method

Alexandru Ioan Cuza walked with cautious steps he was not proclaiming a declaration of independence immediately because he knew it would bring a new war Instead he let Moldavia and Wallachia merged in the United Principalities of the Ottoman Empire and increasing self government to a greater degree

The new union was at the front of todays Romania With cautious steps we freed itself more and Bucharest was established as the capital However farmers had more land when serfdom was abolished which led to a coup against the Alexandru Ioan Cuza staged by peasants who overthrew the regime

Prince Karl of Hohenzollern Sigmaringen became the new leader and was later called Prince Carol I of Romania While the Russo Turkish War was happening Romania battled on the Russian side When the Treaty of Berlin of 1878 was signed the Great Powers made Romania an independent state In return they had to give Russia three of their southern districts of Bessarabia In 1881 the principality became a kingdom with Prince Carol ruling as King Carol I

When World War I started in August of 1914 Romania said it was a neutral country In 1916 after pressure from the Allies Romania joined the Allies Romania then started a war against Austria Hungary

The Romanian military campaign ended in disaster for Romania after the invading forces were stopped in 1917 High mortality among military and civilians were estimated Moldova was one of the only parts of Romania that was not captured when it stopped its attackers in 1917 By the time World War I was over Austria Hungary had been weakened and an independent Hungarian republic was proclaimed This allowed Bessarabia Bukovina and Transylvania to become part of the Kingdom of Romania in 1918 After the Treaty of Trianon was signed in 1920 Hungary as agreed gave up the claims of the Austro Hungarian Monarchy over Transylvania Romania and Bukovina were joined together in 1919 as a result of the Treaty of Saint Germain Bessarabia joined with Romania in 1920 when the Treaty of Paris was signed

The countrys troops fought together with the German Wehrmacht against the Soviet Union In summer of 1941 Romania join Hitlers war against the Soviet Union in combination also Finland Slovakia and Hungary join Hitlers war Romania built concentration camps and began conducting a massive persecution of Jews of which became very extreme in the city of Iasi

Romania participated in the Holocaust The author of the book The Destruction of the European Jews Raul Hilberg writes follow There was  moment when the Germans actually had to intervene and slow the speed with which the Romanian measures were taken The hunt for Jews in eastern Romania had more the character of pogroms than the German well organized camps and transport

There where pogroms in the city of Iasi The homes for the Jewish minority in Iasi were marked with crosses On June 27 1941 Ion Antonescu make a phone call with the citys mayor and Antonescu said into the phone clean the city Iasi from the Jews And the Holocaust in Romania has began Police officers and many civilians went to every Jewish home marked with a cross in the town and murdered thousands of Jews on the same day

In June 1941 the Romanian dictator Ion Antonescu gave an illegal secret order to the special police force He ordered the police in cooperation with the Romanian Army and the German SS troops to kill all Jews in east Romania within the next coming years The Jews living on the countryside was being killed right on the spot The Jews in the cities were first collected in the ghettos and later deported away

On October 22 1941 the Soviet union with bombs blow up the Romanian military headquarters in Odessa and killed 66 Romanian soldiers As revenge Ion Antonescu decided that for every dead Romanian officer 200 Soviet communists must be killed and for each dead soldier 100 communists must be killed All other Communists were imprisoned and Jewish families were taken hostage in the hope that the partisan movement would cease its operations 

The day after in Bucharest on October 23 1941 around 5 000 people and the majority were Jews was arrested who later executed by hanging In the Soviet village Dalnik almost 20000 Jews were incarcerated in to several locked buildings and burned alive

The national debt Romania owed to other countries went from 3 billion to almost 10 billion between 1977 and 1981 The amount of money that Romania owed other countries caused them to rely on banks and other lenders from around the world President Nicolae Ceauescus autarchic ways meant he did not want to rely on other countries and Romania paid back money borrowed from other countries This affected the Romanian economy To try to stay in power Ceauescu had anyone who disagreed with him arrested and put in prison Many people were killed or hurt Almost 60000 people were put in psychiatric hospitals Ceauescu eventually lost power and was killed in the Romanian Revolution of 1989

Several mathematicians distinguished themselves as well among them Gheorghe ieica Spiru Haret Grigore Moisil Miron Nicolescu Nicolae Popescu and tefan Odobleja the latter is also regarded as the ideological father behind cybernetics

Notable physicists and inventors also include Horia Hulubei in atomic physics erban ieica in theoretical physics Mihai Gavril specialized in quantum theory and discoverer of the atomic dichotomy phenomenon Alexandru Proca tefan Procopiu known for the first theory of the magnetic moment of the electron in 1911 Theodor V Ionescu the inventor of a multiple cavity magnetron a hydrogen maser in 1947 3D imaging for cinematelevision in 1924 and hot deuterium plasma studies for controlled nuclear fusion Ionel Solomon known for the nuclear magnetic resonance theory in solids Solomon equations and photovoltaic devices Petrache Poenaru Nicolae Teclu and Victor Toma with the latter known for the invention and construction of the first Romanian computer the CIFA 1 in 1955

To trade is to willingly give things or services and get other things or services in return For example a person giving a thing must find another person who wants to get that thing The giver gets something back in return

A trade is also called an exchange or a swap 

The things that are given from one person to the other are called goods

Services can also be part of a trade One person can do a job or work for another and get something in return in a trade 

Money can be given in return for a service or for a thing If money is part of the trade then the person who gives the money is buying and the person who gets the money is selling

A place where trading takes place is called a market

When there is no money involved in the trade the trade is called barter If there is money involved in the trade the trade is called a purchase In the past people would barter to get what they wanted instead of buying goods and services 

The study of trade is called economics

Today trade occurs not just between people but also between large companies and even countries Countries sometimes take some of the money or goods involved trade between countries This is a type of tax called a tariff Smugglers try to trade without paying tariffs

Free trade between two countries is when there are little or no tariffs on trade 

The European Union is a confederation of 27 member countries in Europe started in 1957 as the European Economic Community It has created a common economic area with Europe wide laws allowing people to move and trade in other EU countries almost like it was their own Seventeen of these countries also share the same money the euro 495 million people live in the European Union When Croatia joins in 2013 the number will go up to 499 million people This organization is very vital to Europe 

The Treaty of Lisbon gave extra additional powers to the EUs leadership

EU is working hard to integrate the member countries in each other That is to say brings them closer together with common passport union currency trading authorities organization and laws

After World War II the countries in Europe wanted to live peacefully together and help one anothers economies Instead of fighting for coal and steel the first member countries Germany France Italy Belgium Netherlands and Luxembourg created one European Coal and Steel Community in 1952

In 1957 in the Italian city of Rome the member countries signed another treaty and made the European Economic Community Now it was a community for coal steel and for trade Later it changed the name to the European Community

In 1993 with the Treaty of Maastricht it changed its name to the European Union Now the member countries work together not only in politics and economy but also in money justice and foreign affairs With the Schengen Agreement 22 member countries of the EU opened their borders to each other so people can now travel from one country to the other without a passport or identity card Now already 16 member countries have replaced their national currencies with the euro10 new countries became members of the EU in 2004 and 2 more became members of the EU in 2007 Today there are 27 member countries altogether

A person who has a passport of a European Union country can live and work in any of the other 27 member countries without needing a work permit or visa For example a British person can move to Greece to work there or just to live there and he or she does not need permission from an authority in Greece

In the same way products made in one member country can be sold in any other member country without any special permissions or extra taxes For this reason the members agree rules on product safety  they want to know that a product made in another country will be as safe as it would be if it had been made in their own country

The Union has three political institutions with the executive and legislative power The Council represents governments the Parliament represents citizens and the Commission represents the European interest The Council Parliament or another party can request legislation from the Commission The Commission then drafts this and presents it to the Parliament and Council In most cases both must agree After it is approved and signed by both chambers it becomes law The Commissions duty is to ensure it is implemented by dealing with the day to day running of the Union

The Council of the European Union is the main decision making group The cabinet ministers of the member countries meet and discuss issues that are important to them 

Each member state takes a turn at being President of the Council for six months For example from January 2007 until July 2007 Germany held the presidency The six months before that Finland held the presidency The President of the Council is the organiser and manager he or she does not have the power to make decisions about the European Union like the President of the United States does for that country

Member countries with a large population have more votes than countries with small populations but a decision cannot be made if enough countries vote against the decision

Twice a year the heads of government andor the heads of state meet to talk about the main issues and make decisions on different issues This meeting is different and not as formal It is known as a European Council

United in diversity is the motto of the European Union

The motto in other languages

The European Commission runs the day to day running of the EU and writes laws like a government Laws written by the Commission are discussed and changed by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union 

The Commission has one President and 27 Commissioners selected by the European Council The Commission President is appointed by the European Council with the approval of the European Parliament

The Commission operates like a cabinet government There is one Commissioner per member state though Commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state

The Parliament has a total of 785 members They are elected in their countries every five years by the citizens of the European Union member countries The Parliament can approve reject or change proposed laws It can also sack the European Commission In that case the entire commission would have to give up their jobs

In 1951 six countries made the European Coal and Steel Community a basic version of what the EU is now These six then went further and in 1957 they made the European Economic Community and the European Coal and Steel Community The UK and others decided not to join and then when the UK changed its mind it was stopped from joining by French President Charles de Gaulle When he was no longer President the UK and others started to join Today there are 27 members but the idea that more should join is not seen as a good one by everyone

Greenland joined as part of Denmark but was given some power to rule itself afterwards With this power it decided to leave the EEC

East Germany and West Germany became one country in 1990 Since then the whole of Germany is an EU member country

Northern Cyprus is officially part of the Cyprus but is not actually controlled by it

Croatia the Republic of Macedonia Turkey and Iceland are candidate countries they are being considered for membership Albania Bosnia and Herzegovina Montenegro and Serbia are expected to follow

There are many discussions in the EU about how it should develop and change in the future

The main reasons why European countries came together are political and economic

Greece officially the Hellenic Republic is a country in Southeastern Europe Its capital city is Athens

It borders Albania the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north and Turkey to the east The Aegean Sea is to the east and south of mainland Greece the Ionian Sea is to the west Both are part of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and have many islands 

The language spoken in Greece is Greek spoken by 99 of the population Many Greeks also understand English French and German which are taught in schools Greece became a member of the European Union in 1981

Greeces history is one of the richest in the world Greece is famous for its many philosophers like Plato and Aristotle and kings like Alexander the Great and Leonidas Greece is said to be the birthplace of Democracy because city states like Athens now the capital of Greece were the first to elect their leaders and not have kings During the years of Alexander the Great a huge Greek empire was created that stretched from modern day Greece to Egypt and Iran until the borders of India Because of the significant role that Greek culture played during that time it is called the Hellenistic period During that time the Greek language became the lingua franca of the middle east which means the language that people who do not speak the same language use to communicate like English is used today as an international language

Greece was then ruled by the Roman Empire and many argue that Rome conquered Greece with its army but Greece conquered Rome with its culture The Roman Empire after the conquest of Greece became a civilization known as the Greco Roman civilization When the Roman Empire collapsed the Greeks emerged as the ruling class of the East Roman Empire and the Greek language became the official language of the country which included all the eastern Mediterranean Sea Turkey Egypt and other countries in the area It was then occupied by the Ottoman Empire for a period of 400 years Some areas of Greece like the second largest city in the country Thessaloniki were occupied for 500 years and became part of Greece less than 100 years ago 

The Greek War of Independence began on the 25th of March 1821 according to tradition and Greece was an independent country in 1828 In reality the Greek War of Independence began on 23 February 1821 when Alexander Ypsilantis declared the start of the revolution in modern day Romania In 1832 Greece was made a kingdom by the United Kingdom and Russia under the German Wittelsbach dynasty Greece fought in both World War I and World War II in the side of allies In 1912 Greece took part in the Balkan Wars where it gained many of the territories that make up the country now such as Greek Macedonia and the islands of the Aegean Sea In 1920 Greece expanded again and reached its maximum size but the territories that the country had gained in Turkey were given back to Turkey in 1923 but Greece kept Western Thrace

In 1940 Greece was invaded by Italy but managed to defeat the Italian invasion and marked the first victory of an Allied country against an Axis power After the defeat of Italy Hitler decided to attack Greece sooner than he had planned Germany invaded on 6 April 1940 and captured Greeces second largest city of Thessaloniki on 9 April while Athens was captured on 27 April Greece suffered major damages in the Second World War and was involved in a civil war between 1946 and 1949 which left the country devastated and the people very poor The Greek civil war was fought between the communists and the people who supported the king who also had support from the United Kingdom and the United States

In 1967 the military took control of the country and restricted democracy Free elections were then held again 7 years later and the Greeks voted to send the king away and declared a republic in 1974 Greece became a member of the European Union in 1981 Greece had seen rapid growth in the 1990s but the countrys economic statistics were false as the government had lied with the help of banks from the United States In 2004 Greece hosted the Olympic Games for a second time Since 2009 Greece has been in an economic crisis which is also becoming a political crisis

Greece is not a federal state like the United States but a unitary state like the United Kingdom It is one of the most democratic countries in the world and is ruled by a parliament called the Hellenic Parliament which has 300 members It is a parliamentary republic which means that unlike in the United States the President has very few powers The person in charge of the government of Greece is the Prime Minister who is elected by the people in elections every four years

Greece was a kingdom for most of its history as an independent nation It officially became the Third Hellenic Republic in 1975 when the monarchy was abolished by a popular vote

Greece was under a military dictatorship between 1967 and 1975 which collapsed after the invasion of Cyprus and handed over power to Constantine Karamanlis Demonstrations by the students of the universities across Greece took place in 1973 but were suppressed by the regime which sent a tank to crash the gates of the Athens Polytechnic and forcefully stop the protests Greece was also under a fascist dictatorship from 1936 until 1941 when it was invaded by Nazi Germany During World War I Greece was divided into two countries the State of Thessaloniki in the north and the State of Athens in the south Both countries claimed to be the legitimate government of Greece but the State of Thessaloniki received support from the Allies The country was reunited in 1917 when the King abdicated 

There are many political parties in Greece but only seven are in the Greek parliament Only two political parties form governments the PASOK party and New Democracy The current government is led by PASOK Other parties include the Communist party the nationalist party and others

The divisions of Greece are called Peripheries As of January 2011 there are 13 peripheries in Greece Peripheries are subdivided into peripheral units and previously they were known as prefecture but prefectures were abolished in 2011 The most populated peripheries in Greece are Attica where the capital city of Greece Athens is and Central Macedonia where Greeces second largest city Thessaloniki is All the peripheries and their capital cities are 

Greece is a small country compared to other countries such as the United States Spain and Italy The population of Greece is estimated to be over 10 million Most of the people in Greece are Greeks and they form 94 of the population of the country There are also many Albanians in Greece and they make up 4 of the population Other nationalities make up for another 2 of the country

The Greek government recognizes only one minority in the country the Turkish one in the region of Thrace The dispute between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia has as a result the refusal of Greece to acknowledge the existence of a Macedonian minority but the 2001 population census showed only 747 citizens of the Republic of Macedonia in Greece The Republic of Macedonia says that there are a maximum of 300000 ethnic Macedonians in Greece but Greece says that if there is a minority in the country it would not be more than 30000 people in the northern part of the country near the border with the Republic of Macedonia This is also supported by international organizations

The Greek flag was officially adopted in 1828 as a civil and state ensign and as a national flag when flown outside of Greece for example on embassies A different flag was used as a land flag within Greece from 1828 until 1969 and from 1975 to 1978 In 1978 the current flag became national flag and the older land flag was abolished 

There are many theories about the origin of the color of the flag One says that the blue represents the color of the sea and the white represents the waves and others include white for the waves and blue for the sky and white for purity and breakaway from tyranny and blue for Greece There are nine stripes on the flag which according to the legend represent the nine syllables in the phrase  which means freedom or death The cross stands for Christianity

Greece is a capitalist country like the United States and France Greece has the largest number of trading ships in the world Tourism is also a major source of income for Greece Currently the country is going through a financial country in order to avoid bankruptcy Greece also has a deficit meaning that it buys more things than it sells 

Although Greece is capitalist it has adopted some socialist policies such as public healthcare and free education like many other European countries

The pension system of Greece has created seriously problem for the whole country The fact is that thousands of Greeks are retired before the age of 55 The government made it easy to won popularity by adjusting the retirement age several times Currently the average age of retirement is 50 for women and 55 for men Its making Greece in to a very difficult situation when the country had accumulated a debt of about 350 billion or debt by 170 per cent of the countrys total GDP

Sweden has an official majority language Swedish Sweden has five official minority languages Finnish Yiddish Sami Menkieli and Romani

Sweden became a member of the European Union in 1995 It is not a member of the European Monetary Union when the Swedish people voted no The currency is the Swedish krona

Sweden has 25 provinces found in 3 different regions Norrland in the North Svealand the central region and Gtaland in the South

During many wars including the Vietnam War and World War II the country was neutral meaning it did not take sides During World War II it sold supplies to both the British and the Germans in order to protect its neutrality 

Sweden is one of the worlds least religious countries 46 85 of all people in Sweden are agnostics or atheists This means they do not believe in a god

Capital can mean

The word capital is sometimes mistaken with capitol A capitol is a building in which a legislature meets

Albert Einstein was one of the most famous scientists of the 20th century 

Einstein published more than 300 scientific papers and over 150 non scientific works He received honorary doctorate degrees in science medicine and philosophy from many European and American universities

On the eve of World War II he helped alert President Franklin D Roosevelt that Germany might be developing an atomic weapon and recommended that the US begin nuclear research That research begun by a newly established Manhattan Project resulted in the US becoming the first and only country to possess nuclear weapons during the war He taught physics at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton New Jersey until his death in 1955

Einstein was born at Ulm in Wrttemberg Germany on March 14 1879 His family was Jewish but was not very religious Albert did not begin speaking until after age two According to his younger sister Maja He had such difficulty with language that those around him feared he would never learn  When Albert was around four his father gave him a magnetic compass He tried hard to understand how the needle could seem to move itself so that it always pointed north The needle was in a closed case so clearly nothing like wind could be pushing the needle around and yet it moved So in this way Einstein became interested in studying science and mathematics His compass inspired him to explore the world Albert went to a Roman Catholic school He was not a good student and many people thought him to not be very smart

When he became older he went to a school in Switzerland After he graduated he got a job in the patent office there While he was working there he wrote the papers that made him famous as a great scientist 

Einstein had two heavily disabled children with his first wife Mileva His daughter Lieserl was born about a year before their marriage in January 1902 She spent her very short life in the care of Serbian grandparents where it is believed she died from scarlet fever Some believe she may have been born with the disorder called Down syndrome but it has never been proven Her very existence only became known to the world in 1986 when a shoe box containing 54 love letters exchanged between Mileva and Einstein from late 1897 to September 1903 was discovered by Einsteins granddaughter in an attic in California Their son Eduard was diagnosed at age 7 with a severe mental illness He spent decades in hospitals and died in the Zurich sanatorium in 1965 

There is an indirect connection between brain size and the size of the neopallium especially important for the brains higher functions However Einsteins brain weight was below average and showed signs of degeneration

In 1917 Einstein became very sick with an illness that almost killed him It was his cousin Elsa Lowenthal who nursed him back to health After this turn of events Einstein divorced Mileva and married Elsa on June 2 1919 

Just before the start of World War I he moved back to Germany and became director of a school there He lived in Berlin until the Nazi government came to power The Nazis hated people who were Jewish or who came from Jewish families They accused Einstein of helping to create Jewish physics and German physicists tried to prove that his theories were wrong 

In 1933 under death threats from the Nazis and despised by the Nazi controlled German press Einstein and Elsa moved to the United States to Princeton New Jersey after feeling the heat of Nazi Germany and in 1940 he became a United States citizen

During World War II Einstein and Le Szilrd wrote to the US president Franklin D Roosevelt to say that the United States should invent an atomic bomb before the Nazi government could invent one first He was not part of the Manhattan Project which was the project to create the atomic bomb He was the only one that signed the letter

Einstein died on 18 April 1955 of a burst aortic aneurysm He was still writing about quantum physics hours before he died

The theory of special relativity was published by Einstein in 1905 on a paper called On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies It states that both distance measurements and time measurements are altered near the speed of light This means that as you get closer to the speed of 300000 kilometres per second lengths appear to shrink and clocks tick more slowly Einstein proposed that Special Relativity is based on two ideas The first is that the laws of physics are the same for all observers that are not moving in relation to each other All the people on a jet airplane would not be moving much in relation to each other but the people in two different jet airplanes that come toward each other would be moving toward each other very fast The people who are all going in the same direction at the same speed are said to be in an inertial frame The second idea is that the speed of light in a vacuum is always the same A vacuum is a volume without any matter in it 

People who are in the same frame will measure how long something takes to happen in the same way Their clocks will keep the same time But people moving in another frame will look over at them and see that their clocks were moving at a different rate The reason that this happens is actually quite simple It is the consequence of two ideas One idea we have seen already No matter what you are doing even if you are moving toward a distant star at half the speed of light or if you are moving away from it at half the speed of light if you measure the speed of the light coming from that star it will always be the same number The other idea goes against our ordinary ideas The other idea says that who is standing still and who is moving is whoever you say is standing still or moving How can that be

Imagine you were all alone in a different universe That universe has no suns planets or anything else It just has you and your spaceship Are you moving Are you standing still Those questions do not mean anything Why Because when we say we are moving we mean that we can measure our distance from something else at one time and measure the distance at another time and the numbers will not be the same If the numbers get bigger we are moving away If the numbers get smaller we are moving closer Suppose a sailor is standing on the edge of a very long boat with a flat top Her boyfriend is standing on the dock They are still very close together so they shout to each other The boat starts to leave The sailor runs toward the back of the boat at the same speed that the boat moves forward so she and her boyfriend can keep talking As far as her boyfriend is concerned she is not moving So to have movement you must have at least two things We do not think about it because when we sit on the earth in a park which is moving very fast around the sun we think we are not moving because we do not get any closer or farther away from the trees in the park

Now imagine that another spaceship appears in this other universe On your spaceship you say that their spaceship is coming closer to yours After all you do not feel yourself moving On their spaceship they say that your spaceship is coming closer to theirs They do not feel themselves to be moving either Somebody on an airplane can be moving at several hundred kilometers per hour but they say I am just sitting here 

Let us try to stretch our minds a bit Imagine that a basketball player is on a glass airplane on the ground People outside can see him very easily He begins to walk from the back of the airplane toward the front of the airplane bouncing his basketball as he goes Maybe the distance between the places where his basketball hits the floor of the airplane is about one meter or one yard If some people are under the airplane they can mark the place directly under the airplane where the ball hits the floor Those marks are a meter or maybe a yard apart So everybody agrees that the bounces are about a meter or a yard apart Later the plane takes off People still watch it from on the ground But this time bounce number 5 is over a place in Gibralter and bounce number 6 is over a place in Spain The distance between bounces is measured in kilometers or miles on the ground but the people on the plane get the same answers they did while the plane was on the ground

Now suppose some people are on a big spaceship and they want to make a very accurate clock So they make a long tunnel between decks from what would be like the top of an airplane to what would be the bottom of an airplane At one end they put a mirror and at the other end they put a simple machine It shoots one short burst of light toward the mirror and then waits The light hits the mirror and bounces back When it hits a light detector on the machine the machine says Count 1 it simultaneously shoots another short burst of light toward the mirror and when that light comes back the machine says Count 2 Of course since light is very fast the count changes very fast They decide that a certain number of bounces will be defined as a second and they make the machine change the seconds counter every time it has detected that number of bounces Every time it changes the seconds counter it also flashes a light out through a porthole under the machine So somebody out taking a space walk will see the light flashing every second

Every grade school child learns the formula drt We know the speed of light and we can easily measure the distance between the machine and the mirror and multiple that to give the distance the light travels So we have both d and r and we can easily calculate t The people on the spaceship compare their new light clock with their various wrist watches and other clocks and they are satisfied that they can measure time well using their new light clock

Now this spaceship happens to be going very fast It is not coming to Earth to visit but it does happen to fly over the North Pole There is a science station with a telescope at the North Pole They see a flash from the clock on the space ship and then they see another flash Only the flashes do not come a second apart They come at a slower rate The reason is that the situation is like the basketball player on the airplane The ball is pushed downward by the players hand That is the light in the spaceships machine firing off a burst toward the mirror The ball hits the floor and bounces That is like the light hitting the mirror and being reflected The ball returns to the players hand That is like the light hitting the machine and triggering a new burst of light Note that the distance between the place on the ground where the basketball is seen to hit the floor and the distance on the ground where the basketball is seen to return to the basketball players hand is some great distance Depending on how fast the plane is going it might be a kilometer or even a mile away

So the man on the North Pole sees the light flash on the side of the spaceship when it is thousands of miles away and then sees the next flash when the spaceship has gotten thousands of miles closer The way the North Pole man sees it the light started out lets say 100000 miles away and hit its return point when it was perhaps 90000 miles away So instead of just traveling twice the diameter of the space ship the light has traveled 10000 miles Light always goes at the same speed d rt and so the time this trip took is going to be much greater as seen by the man on the North Pole That is why the clock on the spaceship is not flashing once a second for the Earth observer 

Special relativity also relates energy with mass in Albert Einsteins Emc2 formula

Emc2 also called the mass energy equivalence is one of the things that Einstein is most famous for It is a famous equation in physics and math that shows what happens when mass changes to energy or energy changes to mass The E in the equation stands for energy Energy is a number which you give to objects depending on how much they can change other things For instance a brick hanging over an egg can put enough energy onto the egg to break it A feather hanging over an egg does not have enough energy to hurt the egg

There are three basic forms of energy potential energy kinetic energy and rest energy Two of these forms of energy can be seen in the examples given above and in the example of a pendulum 

A cannon ball hangs on a rope from an iron ring A horse pulls the cannon ball to the right side When the cannon ball is released it will move back and forth as diagrammed It would do that forever except that the movement of the rope in the ring and rubbing in other places causes friction and the friction takes away a little energy all the time If we ignore the losses due to friction then the energy provided by the horse is given to the cannon ball as potential energy As the cannon ball swings down it gains more and more speed so the nearer the bottom it gets the faster it is going and the harder it would hit you if you stood in front of it Then it slows down as its kinetic energy is changed back into potential energy Kinetic energy just means the energy something has because it is moving Potential energy just means the energy something has because it is in some higher position than something else 

When energy moves from one form to another the amount of energy always remains the same It cannot be made or destroyed This rule is called the conservation law of energy For example when you throw a ball the energy is transferred from your hand to the ball as you release it But the energy that was in your hand and now the energy that is in the ball is the same number For a long time people thought that the conservation of energy was all there was to talk about

When energy transforms into mass the amount of energy does not remain the same When mass transforms into energy the amount of energy also does not remain the same However the amount of matter and energy remains the same Energy turns into mass and mass turns into energy in a way that is defined by Einsteins equation E mc2

The m in Einsteins equation stands for mass Mass is the amount of matter there is in some body If you knew the number of protons and neutrons in a piece of matter such as a brick then you could calculate its total mass as the sum of the masses of all the protons and of all the neutrons Masses pull on each other and a very large mass such as that of the Earth pulls very hard on things nearby You would weigh much more on Jupiter than on Earth because Jupiter is so huge You would weigh much less on the Moon because it is only about one sixth the mass of Earth Weight is related to the mass of the brick and the mass of whatever is pulling it down on a spring scale which may be smaller than the smallest moon in the solar system or larger than the Sun 

Mass not weight can be transformed into energy Another way of expressing this idea is to say that matter can be transformed into energy Units of mass are used to measure the amount of matter in something The mass or the amount of matter in something determines how much energy that thing could be changed into 

Energy can also be transformed into mass If you were pushing a baby buggy at a slow walk and found it easy to push but pushed it at a fast walk and found it harder to move then you would wonder what was wrong with the baby buggy Then if you tried to run and found that moving the buggy at any faster speed was like pushing against a brick wall you would be very surprised The truth is that when something is moved then its mass is increased Human beings ordinarily do not notice this increase in mass because at the speed humans ordinarily move the increase in mass in almost nothing

As speeds get closer to the speed of light then the changes in mass become impossible not to notice The basic experience we all share in daily life is that the harder we push something like a car the faster we can get it going But when something we are pushing is already going at some large part of the speed of light we find that it keeps gaining mass so it gets harder and harder to get it going faster It is impossible to make any mass go at the speed of light because to do so would take infinite energy 

Sometimes a mass will change to energy Common examples of elements that make these changes we call radioactivity are radium and uranium An atom of uranium can lose an alpha particle and become a new element with a lighter nucleus Then that atom will emit two electrons but it will not be stable yet It will emit a series of alpha particles and electrons until it finally becomes the element Pb or what we call lead By throwing out all these particles that have mass it has made its own mass smaller It has also produced energy

In most radioactivity the entire mass of something does not get changed to energy In an atomic bomb uranium is transformed into krypton and barium There is a slight difference in the mass of the resulting krypton and barium and the mass of the original uranium but the energy that is released by the change is huge One way to express this idea is to write Einsteins equation as

E c2

The c2 in the equation stands for the speed of light squared To square something means to multiply it by itself so if you were to square the speed of light it would be 299792458 meters per second times 299792458 meters per second which is approximately2 seconds2 90000000000000000 meters2seconds2 So the energy produced by one kilogram would be E 1 kg 90000000000000000 meters2seconds2 E 90000000000000000 kg meters2seconds2 or E 90000000000000000 joules or E 90000 terajoule 

About 60 terajoules were released by the atomic bomb that exploded over Hiroshima So about two thirds of a gram of the radioactive mass in that atomic bomb must have been lost when the uranium changed into krypton and barium

Bose Einstein condensate was a collaboration between S N Bose and Prof Einstein Einstein himself did not develop it but instead refined the idea and helped it become popular

In classical physics momentum is explained by the equation p mv where p represents momentum m represents mass v represents velocity

Einstein made an equation that takes account of the way mass relates to velocity  E2 2 2 where E represents the energy of the particle c represents the speed of light

There are two special cases of this equation 

In the case of photons because their mass 0 then

E2 0 2 E pc p Ec 

The energy of a photon can be computed from its frequency or wavelength Knowing either frequency or wavelength you can compute the photons momentum

In the case of motionless things with mass since v 0 then E2 2 0 which is just E mc2

A photon has no mass but it nevertheless has momentum In classical physics p mv which means that momentum is defined as the product of mass and velocity But as has been discussed above an increase in velocity also means an increase in mass something that the classical definition of momentum did not think about When Einstein generalized the classical equation to include the increase of mass due to the velocity of the moving matter he arrived at an equation that predicted energy as the sum of two components One component involves mass and the other component involves velocity The equation typically has values greater than zero for both components A 0 mass photon moving at c still has a positive momentum

If people took the positive momentum calculated from the relativistic equation and plugged it back into the classical equation they could falsely conclude that a photon of light has mass But its momentum comes from its energy and not from its mass The momentum of a photon can be figured from the frequency of the photon and the frequency is an aspect of its energy

The famous mass energy equivalency equation can be figured out from classical physics by looking at what happens when a photon is emitted from a light source contained within a box

pphoton  Ec

pbox Mv

t is the time for the photon to reach the other side of the box x is the distance the box will have moved while photon is in flight

Speed of box

There is conservation of momentum therefore 

Mv Ec or M xt Ec

L is the length of the box so time to reach other side of box 

t Lc

so M x Ec

M x  ELc2

If there were some particle being shot instead of light the particle would have some mass m

The center of mass for the box plus the particle would be

We require that the centre of mass of the whole system does not change Therefore the centre of mass at the start of the experiment must be the same at the end of the experiment Mathematically  httpwwwadamautoncomwarpemc2html 

Photon starts at the left end of the box so x2 0  

Mx1  Mx1Mx mL

mL Mx

Above we had M xt Ec 

or  M x Etc 

so

mL Mx  E t c

and t Lc

so

Dividing both sides by L

m Ec2

and rearranging

E mc2

Starting with Maxwells law regarding light having momentum related to its energy Einstein showed that mass must be convertible to energy

The General Theory of Relativity was published in 1915 ten years after the special theory of relativity was created According to the general theory of relativity the gravitational attraction between masses results in the masses in space and time meaning that every object is attracted to each other and that results in space and time Einsteins general relativity also explained spacetime Spacetime is the fact that we have a four dimensional universe having three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension All physical objects us the moon the sun the Milky Way everything is located inside these three dimensions Also mass causes the shape of spacetime to change making it curved All things follow these curves Black holes are a major source of gravitational waves A black hole is an object in the universe that has such a strong pull of gravity that not even light can escape it They are formed when giant stars at least three times the size of our sun dies This is called a supernova Also general relativity explains gravitational lensing which is where light bends when a massive object comes near it This was proven during a solar eclipse when the suns bending of starlight from distant stars could be measured because of the darkness of the eclipse General relativity also set the stage for the theory of the formation of our universe This theory is called the Big Bang General relativity explained singularities which is what scientists think the universe formed from This singularity was small dense and very hot All of the matter that we know today came out of this point 15 billion years ago

Many scientists only care about their work but Einstein also spoke and wrote often about politics and world peace He liked the ideas of socialism and of having only one government for the whole world He also worked for Zionism the effort to try to create the new country of Israel

Einsteins family was Jewish but Einstein never practiced this religion seriously He liked the ideas of the Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza and also thought that Buddhism was a good religionproof

Even though Einstein thought of many ideas that helped scientists understand the world much better he disagreed with many scientific theories that were developed later in his life Many scientific theories discuss things that we cannot know for certain but only as probabilities Einstein did not like these kinds of theories he thought that it should be possible to understand anything if we had the correct theory He once said I do not believe that God plays dice with the Universe

Because Einstein helped science so much his name is now used for several different things A unit used in photochemistry was named for him It is equal to Avogadros number multiplied by the energy of one photon of light The chemical element Einsteinium is named after the scientist as well In slang we sometimes call a very smart person an Einstein

One of his inspiring sayings is There are two ways to live your life one is as though nothing is a miracle the other is as though everything is a miracle

There is still a strong criticism of Einstein Ronald William Clark says that Einstein hated Germany and the Germans since his youth A group in Germany called GO Mueller wrote a whole encyclopedia refuting Einsteins relativity GO Mueller Aristotle Kant and Leibniz say space and time are categories of perception not distortable things and not joined together The speed of light could be higher Paul Dirac and others thought that constants can change over time too GO Mueller lists about 4000 Einstein critical works since 1905 rallying worldwide for rethinking relativity

Euro is the currency of the countries in the eurozone One euro is divided into 100 cent or cents Because of the number of different languages in the EU there are different unofficial names for this unit

It was created in 1999 but until 1 January 2002 it was used only for electronic payments In 2002 12 countries of the EU got rid of their national currencies completely and adopted euro notes and coins as their only money There was a change over period called the transition period when both the old national money and the euro were accepted but by 28 February 2002 all 12 countries were using just euros

In 2007 Slovenia became the 13th country to use the euro In 2008 Cyprus and Malta became the 14th and 15 countries to use the euro In 2009 Slovakia became the 16th country to use the euro In 2011 Estonia became the 17th country to use the euro

There are seven different banknotes each one with a different colour size and face value 5 10 20 50 100 200 500

Coins are of eight different amounts 001 002 005 010 020 050 1 2

On every banknote there is a picture of a different European building style All banknotes are the same throughout the entire eurozone  there are no different designs for different countries unlike the euro coins One side of each coin is the same in all euro countries The other side is different since each country who mints the coins inserts a symbol relating to that country Today there are 12 different sets of coins Any of the coins can be used everywhere throughout the eurozone despite the country specific symbol on the back

The ten new European countries that entered the EU in May 2004 are planning to also adopt the Euro First they must meet some conditions to show that they have stable economies

The symbol for the euro is the Greek letter epsilon with two horizontal lines 

Some people see it as the Latin capital letter C with an equal sign

It is also legal to simply write euro This is especially useful when the symbol cannot be produced or the result is not satisfactory

Members of the eurozone are

Even though they are not part of the EU the euro is also the currency used in

The countries above form the Economic and Monetary Union

Many other countries currencies are pegged to although not exactly equal to the euro

Currency is the unit of money used by the people of a country or Union for buying and selling goods and services

Certain currencies are said to be pegged or fixed to something usually another currency A fixed or pegged currency is one that has a constant value compared to what it is pegged to For example the Cape Verdian escudo is pegged to the Euro If the value of the Euro goes up 1 compared to another form of currency the value of the escudo also goes up 1 compared to that same currency Many countries have used systems where their money was pegged to something other than currency for example gold When they do this as the value of gold increases so does the value of their money Doing this is commonly called using the Gold standard Most countries do not use the Gold standard now 

Some well known currencies are

A radio telescope is like a huge satellite dish An ordinary telescope allows people to see light from distant objects Stars shine and the light can be seen with a telescope but they also give off radio waves Scientists with radio telescopes receive these radio waves and use computers to learn about the stars Other things like black holes also give off radio waves and radio telescopes are useful for learning about them too

The dish is sometimes constructed of a conductive wire mesh whose openings are smaller than a wavelength The information received by several radio telescopes in different places can be combined This gives similar results to having a single dish as big as the distance between the telescopes so even very faint signals can be received Scientists are also trying to do this with ordinary telescopes

The radio telescope at the Parkes Observatory Parkes New South Wales was used by NASA to receive messages from the Apollo 11 moon landings

A light year is a measure of distance that light travels in space in one year Since the speed of light is about 300000 km per second then a light year is about 10 trillion kilometers A light year is not a length of time

The light year is used in astronomy because the universe is huge Space objects such as stars and galaxies may be hundreds thousands or millions of light years away

Think of a star at a distance of 100 light years from us on Earth Light leaves the star and takes 100 years to get to us When we see the stars light we are seeing that star as it was 100 years ago

Korea is in northeast Asia 

Korea was made into two countries after World War II North Korea is a single party state South Korea is a presidential republic North and South Korea and their allies fought each other in the Korean War

People have lived in Korea for about 15000 years In the past some of Manchuria and Siberia were governed by Korea 

The best silk came from Korea In the 7th century the people of China also liked gold workers from Korea Europeans knew very little about Korea until modern times Koreans built a printing machine in 1232 This machine used metal letters This was a long time before Gutenberg made the printing press in Europe

Korea is famous for its traditional food kimchi Kimchi is spicy pickled Chinese cabbage It is very popular in Korea

The Korean people usually eat sticky white rice Kimchi Traditionally Koreans eat seaweed soup on their birthdays People believe the soup is also good for pregnant women

South Korea has over 48 million people and North Korea has more than 23 million South Koreas biggest city is Seoul the capital of South Korea The city has more than 10 million people and the region of Seoul has more than 21 million people North Koreas biggest city is Pyongyang the capital of North Korea It has fewer than 4 million people

Korean people speak Korean Many people in South Korea study English and other languages Children in South Korea learn English and other languages in school 

South Korea is an advanced country with large cities high speed trains high speed internet and many television and radio networks Many Korean television dramas are popular around the world Korean TV commercials are among the most expensive in the worldfactdateJuly 2010 But there are still poor areas in Korea The Korean farmers are not rich and struggle to compete with cheap food from other countries

Gochosun is the first state in Korean history It was established in 2333 BCE Its real name is Chosun but it is called Gochosun to make it different from other Chosun in Korean history Go is a Korean prefix meaning old The founder of Gochosun is said to be Dangun The Korean people believe that Dangun established the country on October 3rd and still celebrate that day In Korea October 3rd is a national holiday which is named Kaecheonjeol It is said to be the day that Danguns father whose name is Hwan ung came from sky on October 3rd 2457 BCE Gochosun was destroyed by the Chinese Han Dynasty in 108 BCE

After Gojoseon had been destroyed there were many ancient confederations in the Korean Peninsula and Manchuria Mahan Byeonhan Jinhan Buyeo Dongye Okjeo Goguryeo and so on

The ancient confederation countries later merged into three more powerful kingdoms and a advanced confederation country

Between 57 BC and the year 668 there were three kingdoms in Korean Peninsula and Manchuria The names of the kingdoms were Silla Goguryeo and Baekje In the year 372 the religion Buddhism came from China to Korea Buddhism was very important in Korea

In the year 660 the kingdom of Silla invaded the kingdom of Baekje In the year 668 the kingdom of Silla invaded the kingdom of Gyguryeo The people of Goguryeo ran away and made a new kingdom with the name Barhae After a little time the kingdom of Balhae was invaded by Liao Dynasty

Here are some words for small numbers Words in bold are irregular

When writing other numbers between 21 and 99 you must use a hyphen

The number 100 is written as one hundred but sometimes people say a hundred

To write a number from 100 to 999

Examples

The United States dollar or the American dollar is the official currency or money of the United States of America When writing the symbol for the American dollar is the dollar sign Dollars can also be known as USD

The American one dollar bill has a picture of George Washington There are paper bills that are worth 1 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 dollars

There are also dollar coins Some of them are silver and some of them are gold colored Vending machines often give dollar coins as change since it is easier for the machines to give out coins than paper money But most of the time people use paper dollars

There are 100 cents in one American dollar The cent or penny is the smallest or least worth coin used in the US There are half dollar coins which are worth 50 cents Quarters are worth 25 cents dimes are worth ten cents nickels are worth five cents and pennies are worth one cent All coins and paper bills have the faces of famous Americans on the front side

The paper dollar bill is actually called a Federal Reserve Note Federal refers to the US government The United States Constitution first said that the government must hold enough gold to redeem the paper money it printed This means that if needed paper money could be traded to the government for gold The government of the United States stopped using this gold standard in 1971 which means it no longer needs to have enough gold to trade for paper money

The Federal Reserve is the federal governments bank It lets other banks borrow money The banks then let people and companies take the money from them The banks then pay money at a rate called the Federal Funds Rate This number is set by the Federal Reserve Board and is changed however money is in the country The paid rate is called the overnight lending rate because money is borrowed for a small time

By giving to banksthe Fed can bring more money into the world and focus interest on newly created money

Many dollars never enter into the cycle which makes money They are held in digital accounts and never live in paper form After printing by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing the real paper dollars are sold for no more than the cost of the ink and paper

A meteor shower is when pieces of rock and dust burn in the Earths atmosphere 

Many objects in space cross the Earths orbit from time to time such as comets and rocks When the Earth passes through the dust and pieces left behind by these rocks they are attracted by the Earths gravity and eventually burn in the Earths atmosphere When a lot of particles enter the atmosphere at the same time we see a shower like effect

Cats also called domestic cats or house cats are carnivorous mammals of the family Felidae 

Cats have been domesticated for nearly 10000 years They are currently the most popular pets in the world Their origin is probably the African Wildcat Felis silvestris lybica

Cats were probably first kept because they ate mice and this is still their main job in farms throughout the world Later they were kept because they are friendly and good companions 

A young cat is called a kitten Cats are sometimes called kitty or pussycat An entire female cat is a queen and an entire male cat is a tom 

Domestic cats are found in shorthair and longhair breeds Cats which are not specific breeds can be referred to as domestic shorthair or domestic longhair

The word cat is also used for other felines Felines are usually classed as either big cats or small cats The big cats are well known lions tigers leopards jaguars pumas and cheetahs There are small cats in most parts of the world such as the lynx in northern Europe The big cats and wild cats are not tame and can be very dangerous

Throughout history people kept cats because the cats hunted and ate mice rats and insects 

Ancient Egyptians worshipped cats as gods and often mummified them so they could be with their owners for all of eternity Today people often keep cats as pets but there are also cats that live without being cared for by people These kinds of cats are called feral cats 

Today special food for cats is widely available in the developed countries Proper feeding will make a cat live much longer compared to hunting or being fed table scraps Not correctly feeding a cat can lead to problems

Cats cannot taste sweet foods because of a mutation in their ancestors which removed the ability to taste sweet things

Cats are active carnivores meaning they hunt live prey Their main prey is small mammals They will also stalk and sometimes kill and eat birds Cats eat a wide variety of prey including insects and seem especially to like house flies and bluebottles Their main method of hunting is stalk and pounce While dogs have great stamina and will chase prey over long distances cats are extremely fast but only over short distances The basic cat coat colouring tabby gives it good camouflage in grass and woodland The cat creeps towards a chosen victim keeping its body flat and near to the ground so that it cannot be seen easily until it is close enough for a rapid dash or pounce Cats especially kittens practice these instinctive behaviours in play with each other or on small toys

Cats are quiet and well behaved animals making them popular pets Young kittens are playful They can easily entertain themselves with a variety of store bought or homemade toys House cats have also been known to teach themselves to use doorknobs and toilet handles 

Cats use many different sounds for communication including meowing purring trilling hissing growling squeaking chirping clicking and grunting 

Body posture is also important The whole shape of the body changes when a cat is relaxed or when it is alert Also the position of their ears and tail are used for communication as well as their usual functions

These ways of communication are very important They are used between a mother cat and her kittens They are also used between male and female cats and between cats and other species such as dogs A mother cat protecting her kittens will fight off the largest dog She gives good warning with a frightening display hissing furiously showing her claws arching her back and making her hair stand on end If that fails she attacks the dogs face with her claws It has been said that no dog ever tries such an attack a second time

Cats only mate when the queen is in heat Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last 4 to 6 days Mating in cats is a spectacular event Several toms may be attracted to a queen in heat The males will fight over her and the victor wins the right to mate At first the female will reject the male but eventually the female will allow the male to mate The female will utter a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her This is because a male cats penis has a band of about 120 150 backwards pointing spines which are about one millimeter long upon withdrawal of the penis the spines rake the walls of the females vagina which is a trigger for ovulation After mating the female will wash her vulva thoroughly If a male attempts to breed with her at this point the female will attack him After about 20 to 30 minutes once the female is finished grooming the cycle will repeat

Because ovulation is not always triggered females may not get pregnant by the first tom which mates with them A queen may mate with more than one tom when she is in heat and different kittens in a litter may have different fathers The cycle ceases when the queen is pregnant

The gestation period for cats is about two months with an average length of 66 days The size of a litter is usually three to five kittens Kittens are weaned at between six and seven weeks and cats normally reach sexual maturity at 510 months and to 57 months Females can have two to three litters per year so might produce up to 150 kittens in their breeding life of about ten years

Pregnant queens deliver their litters by themselves guided by instinct The queen finds the safest place she can Then she will clean it thoroughly with her tongue if necessary Here she will quietly give birth She licks the newborn kits clean In the wild leaving a scent is risking a dangerous encounter with other animals The kits are born blind and with closed eyes They suckle on her teats and sleep a good deal After two weeks or so their eyes open At that stage they have hair and blue eyes A bit later the best developed kit will totter out of the nest The others follow They will soon recognise you as a living thing that is a great moment At first they go back to the nest to feed and sleep After some more days they leave the nest for good but still they may sleep together in a kitten heap

The queen meanwhile has left the nest from time to time to hunt feed and also to urinate and defecate Unlike the tom she covers up her business to hide her scent Very soon the kits will urinate anywhere they please unless one trains them This is done after they are weaned when they are ready for some kitten food Here is how to do it

What you have done is exactly what the queen would do in the wild You have triggered a reflex which all kittens have The thing is the tray is artificial and your queen may do her business outside But at least when young kittens need a tray Your next job is to ring the vet who will tell you when to bring the kits for their vaccination

Kittens play endlessly It is how they do their learning They will play their favourite games such as hide and pounce with almost anyone or anything Soft balls on strings are a standard toy so is a scratching post 

With cats there is a limit to how far you can train them They are at least as intelligent as dogs but they are not pack animals They like to do their own thing and owners do best by fitting in Never chastise a cat physically if you do the relationship will never be the same again If you really want to dissuade them try hissing Also a noise they do not like will make them leave It has been said that no one really owns a cat many cats collect extra owners and may change house if they do not like the treatment

If your kitten was born in your house do not let it out of the house until it is two to three months old If you have the mother she will look after the kit But if you have got the kit from a vet or dealer keep it in for several weeks When it does go out you need to watch over it The main problem is that it may easily get lost In time the kit will learn every inch of the house and garden Then you can happily let it roam

Cats are very clean animals They groom themselves by licking their fur The cats tongue can act as a hairbrush and can clean and untangle a cats fur Still many owners buy grooming products so the cat will not always be depended on to take care of itself After licking their fur cats sometimes get hairballs A hairball is a small amount of fur that is vomited up by animals when it becomes too big This is quite normal Owners brush their cats to try to prevent a lot of hairballs

Many house cats eat food which their owners give them This food is manufactured and designed to contain the right nutrients for cats There are many different types of cat food These come in many different flavors and costs are often very small

There is moist canned food and also dry cat food which comes in different sized cans or bags and formulas There are kitten formulas cat formulas health formulas formulas for reducing a cats weight and many others These can even be organic and have vegetables salmon tuna meat and milk essence Yet its best if the food is at least 95 meat as thats a cats diet Also make sure the cat is not fed a daily diet of dog food It could make the cat blind as it has no taurine which is a nutrient for the eyes

Cats do get diseases and prevention is better than cure It is most important to get a young cat vaccinated against some of the most deadly diseases If a cat gets a disease you take it to a vet Some cats depending on breed gender age and general health may be more susceptible to disease than others Regular visits to a vet can keep a cat alive many extra years by catching sickness and disease early

Cats which roam outside will get fleas at some time Cat fleas will not live on people but if your cat has them the fleas will not hesitate to give you a nip as well You can buy anti flea collars but also you need to clean up any areas where the cat normally sleeps Your vet or local pet shop will give you advice Dont delay because fleas can make your cat pretty unhappy

House cats can become overweight through lack of exercise and over feeding When they get spayed or neutered they tend to exercise less Spaying is done for queens and neutering is done for toms It is important to fix cats and here are some reasons First of all if your female cat has kittens you will need to find homes for them That is often quite difficult If a tom is not fixed it develops a disgusting smell and you will not enjoy having it in the house Breeders who have entire toms keep them in a special hut outside the house for that reason Fixing also helps to avoid over population Over population means that there are too many cats and some will be put to sleep in animal pounds

Kittens are sometimes born with defects If you buy or accept the gift of a cat get it examined for its health Reject any which are not in good shape once you own a cat you are responsible for its welfare Some birth defects like heart problems require urgent vet attention Others are harmless like polydactyly Polydactyly means many digits or many fingers from poly and dactyl Sometimes there is a mutation in cat families Most cats have only four to five toes per paw depending on whether it is the front or back paw These mutated cats have six seven and in rare cases even more All of these cats are called polydactyl cats They can also be called Hemingway cats because author Ernest Hemingway owned many of these cats

There are quite a number of reference books on cats Look for titles like Encyclopedia of the cat or Cat encyclopedia 

Engineering is the use of science and math to design or make things People who do engineering are called engineers They learn engineering by studying at a college or university Engineers usually design or build things that are sold or given to people Some engineers also use their skills to solve technical problems There are different types of engineers that design everything from computers and buildings to watches and websites 

Engineering is a big subject Here are a few of the many types of engineers

Engineers do not only work with machines They also work a lot with other people Many engineering projects are large and very complicated Often different kinds of engineers work together and help each other As an example computer engineers need help from electrical engineers to build a computer The computer needs programs written by software engineers The computer could be used by aerospace engineers to control an airplane An airplane is a big mechanical system with many parts so a mechanical engineer and a systems engineer are also needed

Most engineers are trained to be very clever Much of their training involves working within a limited budget and materials

In the United States most engineers go to a college or university to get an engineering degree Most people go to school for four years to get a Bachelors degree in engineering A Masters Degree is an advanced degree usually requiring two more years of study after the Bachelors A person with a Masters degree is eligible to enter a Doctoral program in engineering A graduate of a Doctoral program is awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree which is commonly called a PhD A PhD in engineering requires three or four years of study after a Masters degree and includes the completion of a long research report called a dissertation After having gained enough work experience one can sit for their Professional Engineers License reinforcing their demonstrated proficiency in their speciality

In the United Kingdom engineering degrees at universities are either three year BEng or four year MEng In many universities it is common to take only one engineering discipline although some universities have a general engineering degree British universities may also offer Doctoral programs as a doctor of philosophy or a doctor of engineering

Engineers can also get additional recognition in the form of becoming Chartered A chartered engineer is one who has his degree or doctorate has been recognised by a group of professionals such as the IET IMechE or ICE Experience and responsibility enables a further step of recognition by becoming a Fellow of these institutions

The best way to become an engineer in France is to take the CPGE for two years and then study for three years in an Ecole dIngnieur You can also study in an IUT for two years and then study three years in an Ecole dIngnieur

Communication is when information is passed from a sender to a recipient using a medium There are different media that can be used

Communication can be spoken or non spoken Communication has many ways and happens all the time Not only humans communicate most other animals do too Some communication is done without thinking such as by changing in posture

Communication works by exchanging information or messages In very basic terms

Besides the content of the message there are other things that are important These are not part of the message itself but rather of its context

For a message exchange to be successful the sender and the recipient must have agreed on a vocabulary The word hedge can mean completely different things based on the context In biology a hedge is a row of shrubs or trees that make a barrier or form a border In finance a hedge is an investment made to reduce the risk of another investment In linguistics a hedge is a word or set of words that make other words less important Without any information it is therefore very difficult to know which hedge is really meant by the speaker

A Miracle is an amazing beneficial event that goes against the laws of nature Some people say that a miracle is always an act brought about by God or other supernatural force Others say that there can always be another explanation for it

In the Bible a miracle is an act by God where Gods presence is shown They can be an act that affects one person or a gigantic disturbance of nature that changes the world

Here are seven types that can be found These are just some of the many miracles in the Bible

Quran Mahabharata and the Avesta contains many references to this definition of miracle An example from the Bible would be

It is usually said that there are eight million Kami In Japanese the number eight million is normally used to mean infinity

Cardboard is a heavy type of paper notable for its stiffness and durability It was first invented in China some time in the 15th century and is used for a wide variety of purposes One of its more common uses is as a packaging material

Cardboard boxes were first produced commercially in 1817 in England Corrugated paper was patented in England in 1856 used as a liner for tall hats but corrugated cardboard would not be patented and used as a shipping material until 20 December 1871 The patent was issued to Albert Jones of New York City New York for single sided corrugated cardboard Jones used the corrugated cardboard for wrapping bottles and glass lantern chimneys The first machine for producing large quantities of corrugated cardboard was built in 1874 by G Smyth and in the same year Oliver Long improved upon Jones design by inventing corrugated cardboard with liner sheets on both sides This was now cardboard as we know it today

The American Robert Gair invented the corrugated cardboard box in 1890 consisting of pre cut flat pieces manufactured in bulk that folded into boxes Gairs invention as with so many other great innovations came about as a result of an accident he was a Brooklyn printer and paper bag maker during the 1870s and while he was printing an order of seed bags a metal ruler normally used to crease bags shifted in position and cut the bag Gair discovered that by cutting and creasing cardboard in one operation he could make prefabricated cartons Extending this to corrugated cardboard was a straightforward development when the material became available By the start of the 20th century corrugated cardboard boxes began replacing the custom made wooden crates and boxes previously used for trade

The Kellogg brothers first used cardboard cartons to hold their flaked corn cereal and later when they began marketing it to the general public a heat sealed waxed bag of Waxtite was wrapped around the outside of the box and printed with their brand name This marked the origin of the cereal box though in modern times the sealed bag is plastic and is kept inside the box rather than outside

Cardboard packaging has undergone a minor resurgence in recent times due to the trend towards environmentalism It is now common for cardboard to be manufactured with a large percentage of recycled fibers

The English language is the language created by tribes that moved to Britain from West Germany around 450 AD The Germanic languages spoken by these tribes became Anglo Saxon or Old English 

Modern English is spoken in many countries around the world There are about 375 million native speakers which makes English the second most spoken language in the world About 220 million more people speak it as a second language and there are as many as a billion people who are learning English has changed and has been changed by many different languages

English began in England a country on the island of Great Britain in Europe Germanic tribes came to Britain from around 449 AD They made their home in the south and east of the island pushing out the Celtic Britons who were there before them or making them speak the English language instead of the old Celtic language There are still Celtic Britons today in Wales and Cornwall who speak Welsh or Cornish The Germanic dialects of these different tribes became Old English The word English comes from the name of the Angles Englas Old English did not sound or look much like the English we speak today If English speakers today were to hear or read a passage in Old English they would not understand most words but might understand a few

The closest language to English that is still used today is Frisian spoken by about 500000 people living in the Netherlands Germany and Denmark Despite its similarity to English speakers of the two languages would not be able to understand each other But there are still some people that strongly suggest that the closest language to English is the Dutch language

Many other people came to England later at different times speaking different languages and these languages added more words to make todays English 

For example around 800 AD many Danish and Norse pirates also called Vikings came to the country and English received many Norse loanwords Their languages were Germanic languages like Old English

After William the Conqueror took over England in 1066 AD with his armies and became king he brought his nobles who spoke Norman a language closely related to French to be the new government They stopped English from being taught in schools for a long time and the language changed greatly because it was mostly being spoken instead of written for about 300 years English borrowed so many words from Norman at that time that it could be called a different language Middle English Geoffrey Chaucer is a well known writer of Middle English After more sound changes Middle English became Modern English Although the works of Shakespeare might seem very old they are actually called modern 

English has continued to take new words from other languages for example mainly from French but also Chinese Hindi and Urdu Japanese Spanish and Portuguese Because many scientists from different countries needed to talk to each other they chose names for scientific things in the languages they all knew Greek and Latin Those words came to English also for example photography or telephone So English is made of Old English Danish Norse and French and has been changed by Latin Greek Chinese Hindi Japanese and Spanish and more words from even more languages

The history of the British Empire has added to the spread of the English language English is an important language in many places today like in Australia Canada Hong Kong the Republic of India and Pakistan South Africa and the United States English is the main language Because the United Kingdom and the United States have historically been powerful in money making and government many people find it helpful to learn English to communicate in science business and diplomacy This is called learning English as an additional language English as a Second Language or English as a Foreign Language

Many famous stories and plays are in English Shakespeare was a famous English writer of poems and plays Today many famous songs and movies use the English language

English uses difficult and strange spelling when written Sounds for the letters and combinations look the same but can be very different For example ough is different in through rough dough or cough This makes it a very hard language to learn Many English speaking countries spell words differently There is a difference between some spellings in America on the one hand and the United Kingdom and many other countries where English is the main language on the other hand These different ways of spelling are sometimes called American English and British English For example colour is spelled color in the USA and programme is spelt program in the USA However with greater globalization or globalisation and the spread of US culture through television and US computer programmes some British people now sometimes use American English terms

William Shakespeare was an English author who wrote 38 plays and also many poems in his lifetime He lived in Stratford upon Avon in Warwickshire England His plays are still performed today He is often quoted in modern writing 

He became an actor in 1594 in the Lord Chamberlains Men production house

His plays are of different kinds or genres There are histories tragedies and comedies These plays are among the best known in English literature children study them in schools around the world Shakespeare wrote his works between about 1590 and 1613

Shakespeare has been credited for adding new words and phrases to the English language and for making some words more popular

Not a lot information is known about Shakespeares life He was married to Anne Hathaway a woman 8 years older than he was He had three children Susanna Hall Hamnet Shakespeare and Judith Quiney By 1592 he had become an actor and was becoming well known as a writer of plays At the time of his death in 1616 Shakespeare had never published his plays The reason why is unknown The plays were collected and published some years after his death Friends had realized that other people were publishing changed copies of the plays

There is proof that people in Shakespeares time thought highly of him After his death even his rival Ben Jonson said

He was involved in the building of the Globe Theater in 1599

Strangely he died on the same day he was born

Although Shakespeare married to a woman and fathered three childrenSuzanne Hamnet and Judith people have debated his sexuality Some people such as Professor Peter Holland of the Shakespeare Institute at Birmingham University have argued that Shakespeare was possibly bisexual because of some of the sonnets he wrote that were directed toward young men

About 150 years after Shakespeare died some writers began to say that the work called Shakespeare were not really written by William Shakespeare They had various reasons for saying this For example the person who wrote Shakespeare knew a lot about other countries but William Shakespeare never left England Several other writers of Shakespeare have been suggested such as Francis Bacon Christopher Marlowe and Edward de Vere 17th Earl of Oxford Most scholars believe that William Shakespeare did write the works that bear his name but the idea that someone else wrote Shakespeare is still often talked about

Here is a full list of all of Shakespeares plays

The Bible is a collection of texts written by different people Certain texts were written by historians who tried to show what Ancient Israel was like Other texts are poems about God Still others were used to make laws All texts were written over a period of about 1200 years Followers of Judaism and Christianity consider the Bible sacred but they do not all agree about what belongs in the Bible A number of texts are both in the Hebrew Bible used by Jews and the Christian one 

Some Christian Bibles are interpretive translations of Hebrew and Greek writings into English and are therefore full of errors and misunderstandings of the texts they seek to interpret It is widely considered a wise course of action to accept the fact that many errors have occurred and only private study of the ancient languages or careful use of dictionaries can overcome these errors for the Bible student Some Bibles such as the 1611 King James Translation are directly translated into English from the original languages The accuracy of literal translation without human interpretation was ensured by many different scholars congruently translating every word from the original scripts 

There are many names for the Bible some call it Holy Scripture Holy Writ or the Good Book The Bible was written long ago in Hebrew Aramaic and Greek and translations were made later into Latin and some other languages Now there are translations in English and many other languages The word bible is a transliteration of the Greek word biblos which means simply book

When talking about the Bible a book is used to speak about a number of texts All the texts that make a book are believed to belong together Most of the time people believe they were written or collected by the same person Sometimes all the texts of a book also have a common subject for example how to punish someone who has done something against the law The Bible contains different kinds of such books Some are history telling the stories of the Jews Jesus or Jesus followers Some are collections of wise sayings Some are Gods commands to His people which He expects them to obey Some are songs of praise to God Some are books of prophecy messages from God that He gave through chosen people called prophets

What is considered part of the Bible changed with history Different denominations include certain parts or leave out other parts There is not one single version of the Bible both the content of the books and their order change The Hebrew Bible contains 39 books Christian Bibles range from the 66 books of the Protestant canon to 81 books in the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible The oldest surviving Christian Bible is the Codex Sinaiticus a Greek manuscript from the fourth century AD The oldest complete Hebrew manuscripts date from the Middle Ages 

As the Bible has been translated into modern languages it is also possible that there are different translations of the same texts The Bible is the best selling book of all time 25 billion to more than 6 billion copies of the Bible have been sold to date

Today a complete version of the Bible exists in 429 languages Parts have been translated in 2429 languages Most Bibles can be found in the British Museum in London

The Bible is a collection of books The first part is called the Old Testament or Tanakh It was mostly written in Hebrew a few parts are written in Aramaic This part of the Bible is considered to be holy by Jews as well as Christians 

There are a few parts of the Old Testament that can be proven by science These parts are called Deuterocanonical by those Churches that accept them as part of the Bible and Apocrypha by those that do not

The second part is called the New Testament which is written in Greek and Aramaic The main part of this book is the story of the life of Jesus Christ The four different versions of this story in the New Testament are called the Gospels After the Gospels there is also the story of what happened after Jesuss death Part of this is told through letters by early Christian leaders especially Saint Paul One of the most quoted verses in the Bible is John 316 For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son that whoever believes in Him shall not perish die but have eternal life NIV

People have different ideas about the Bible Christians believe it is Gods Word to people The Jews believe that only the Old Testament is from God Protestants and Catholics believe that the Old and New Testaments are Gods Word Catholics also believe that the books called Apocryphal or Deuterocanonical are part of the Bible Sometimes different denominations disagree over exactly what the Bible means

According to Islam much of the Bible is true but the Koran is better Atheists do not believe that God exists so they do not believe that God could have sent people to the earth to write the Bible

Regions

In the 15th century Portuguese people came to Gore Island off the coast of Dakar In the 17th century French people and Dutch people came there too These European countries used the island as a trading post in slaves from the mainland controlled by the Muslim Wolof Empires Slavery was later made illegal by France but soon after around 1850 the French started to conquer the Wolof By 1902 Senegal was a part of the French colony French West Africa 

In January 1959 Senegal and the French Sudan became one to form the Mali Federation which became fully independent on June 20 1960 as a result of the independence and transfer of power agreement signed with France on April 4 1960 This did not last long and Senegal and Mali broke apart into separate nations Between 1982 and 1989 Senegal and The Gambia joined together to make Senegambia 

Developmental biology is the study of the process by which organisms grow and develop 

Modern developmental biology studies the genetic control of cell growth differentiation and morphogenesis These are the processes which turn a zygote into an adult animal

Differentiation is the formation of cell types from what is originally one cell the zygote or spore The formation of cell types like nerve cells occurs with a number of intermediary less differentiated cell types A cell stays a certain cell type by maintaining a particular pattern of gene expression293 5 This depends on regulatory genes

Embryogenesis is the step in the life cycle after fertilisation the development of the embryo starting from the zygote Organisms can differ drastically in the how embryo develops especially when they belong to different phyla 

Growth is the enlargement of a tissue or organism Growth continues after the embryonic stage and occurs through cell division enlargement of cells or accumulation of extracellular material In plants growth results in an adult organism that is strikingly different from the embryo The dividing cells tend to be distinct from differentiated cells 

In some tissues dividing cells are restricted to special areas such as the growth plates of bones467 482 But some stem cells move to where they are needed from the bone marrow to form muscle bone or adipose tissue

Many animals have a larval stage with a body plan different from that of the adult organism The larva abrubtly develops into an adult in a process called metamorphosis For example caterpillars are specialized for feeding whereas adult butterflies are specialised for flight and reproduction When the caterpillar has grown enough it turns into an immobile pupa Here the imago develops from imaginal discs found inside the larva575 585

Regeneration is the reactivation of development so that a missing body part grows back This phenomenon has been studied particularly in salamanders where the adults can reconstruct a whole limb after it has been amputated Researchers hope to one day be able to induce regeneration in humans There is little spontaneous regeneration in adult humans although the liver is a notable exception Like for salamanders the regeneration of the liver involves reversing some cells to an earlier state592 601

The 1920s was the decade that started on January 1 1920 and ended on December 31 1929 This decade was known as the Roaring Twenties or the Jazz Age

Space also known as outer space is where everything is found Items in space are free to move in four different ways

This is why scientists say that space is four dimensional

The majority of space contains very little matter and so most of is a vacuum Nobody knows how big space is but we do know that space is extremely big and is always expanding

According to the big bang theory space started as a small point and gradually grew in size Space is still growing in size today this mean the distance from the earth to other suns is getting longer

Gravity can stretch and bend space similar to how a heavy ball placed on a stretched piece of rubber will cause the rubber to stretch The scientist who discovered that space can bend is named Albert Einstein How gravity bends space is part of his theory of general relativity 

Exploring space is very difficult because it contains no air is extremely cold and is so large that even the fastest ships can only explore a tiny part of it It takes 3 days of traveling to reach the moon and depending on speed it would take a long time to reach the closest star Proxima Centauri 

Space ships are designed to keep air inside of them and to protect astronauts from extreme temperatures

We gain most of our information about the items inside space from different kinds of telescopes 

A natural satellite is a natural object that goes around a planet It is usually called a moon and is large and ball shaped The Earth has only one moon Some other planets have many moons and some have none When people write just the moon they are usually talking about the moon of the Earth Earths moon is written with a capital letter Moon The Latin word for the moon is luna which is why the adjective used to talk about the moon is lunar For example lunar eclipse 

Anything that goes around a planet is called a satellite Moons are natural satellites People also use rockets to send machines into orbit around the Earth These machines are called artificial satellites They help us to communicate the telephones and televisions need these satellites 

Moons do not make their own light We can see the Earths moon because it acts like a mirror and reflects the light of the Sun The same half of the moon faces toward Earth at all times no matter where it moves But different parts of the moon are lit up by the Sun so it looks different at different times of the month This change as seen from Earth is called the phases of the moon or lunar phases

A moons cycle is the time the moon takes to change from looking very bright and round to looking very small and thin and then back to bright and round again In the case of the Earths moon this is about four weeks It does this about 13 times in one year The moons cycle is about 28 days a bit shorter than a calendar month

The Apollo 11 mission helped Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin become the first people to walk on the Moon They did this in July 20 1969

The orbit of a moon or other satellite is affected by two forces gravity and the centripetal force For example the Earths moon is kept in orbit by the gravitational pull from the Earth This is also the way the Earth is attracted to the Sun and stays in its orbit The orbit of the Earths moon actually causes the tides and waves on Earth 

No moons that belong to moons have been found In most cases the tidal effects of the main body would make such as unstable 

However math completed after the recent finding of a possible ring system around Saturns moon Rhea show that Rhean orbits would be stable Also the rings are thought to be narrow something that is known with shepherd moons

The finding of 243 Idas moon Dactyl in the early 1990s was the proof that some asteroids have moons indeed 87 Sylvia has two Some such as 90 Antiope are double asteroids with two same sized parts

The biggest moons in the Solar System are Earths moon Jupiters Galilean moons Saturns moon Titan and Neptunes captured moon Triton 

The following is a table grouping the moons of the solar system by diameter The column on the right has some notable planets dwarf planets asteroids and Trans Neptunian Objects for comparing It is normal for moons to be named after people from mythology

Planets in our Solar System that have moon

Planets in our Solar System that do not have moons

Gravity is the force that draws an object or living thing towards another The word comes from the Latin gravis meaning heavy

You and the Earth have mass so the Earth pulls on you and you pull on the Earth This pull is what we call weight The Moon has 16 the mass of the Earth So if you were on the moon the pull between you and the moon would be six times smaller This means your weight on the Moon would be six times smaller Your mass is always the same It does not matter if you are on the Earth or the Moon or anywhere else your mass does not change

Things that are falling still have mass but we cannot measure their weight so we say that they are weightless Astronauts and spacecraft in outer space can be weightless They look like they are floating Really they are falling in an orbit around the Earth 

They still have mass so we still have to push them or pull them to make them go or stop Astronauts inside spacecraft use their arms and legs to jump or to stop Spacecraft use rockets to move

Sir Isaac Newton is said to have discovered gravity when he saw an apple fall from a tree He wondered what made this happen and worked out the laws the force of gravity seems to follow These rules are simple but surprisingly accurate they have been used to work out how to get space probes to planets across billions of miles

In 1915 Albert Einstein showed that gravity could be explained as the bending of space by mass A planet makes a dent in space that makes things fall towards it or curve around it The moving object is passing through more space in the same amount of time at the same speed In fact there is also an effect on time Einstein predicted that time slows down near a large mass and this has been verified using very accurate clocks on satellites Some scientists have looked at Einsteins theories and found ideas in them that gravity could not actually be a force However they have not yet come up with a more precise definition

Recent studies suggest that frame dragging may be responsible for gravity Frame dragging is a theory which states that particles interact with space and are constantly changing energy levels They are performing tests such as Gravity Probe B to see if this theory is correct

Some people think that gravity is carried by a particle called the graviton but so far no evidence for this has been found

Centripetal force is a type of force that acts on any body that revolves around a centre This force contributes to keeping the body in circular motion This force is always directed towards the centre

The opposite force is called centrifugal force This is the force that acts on the body in a direction away from the centre which contributes to making the body try to fly away When you hold a rope with a heavy object attached to it and rotate it around the rope becomes tight and keeps the body from flying away This is caused by centripetal force An example is a roller coaster which uses centripetal force to keep the carts going in a circular motion

A treaty is a written agreement between two or more parties The parties may be countries or other important groups A treaty may be about any subject Two countries might agree to stop a war allow each others citizens to cross borders freely or declare war on a common enemy Treaties are usually used to settle disputes The European Union is set up by treaties between most of the European nations

Emphysema is a disease of the lungs It is one of the diseases that make up COPD which is a set of diseases where the flow of air in the lungs is obstructed Emphysema is most often caused by smoking but can be caused by other diseases or have no known cause at all It occurs when the very small air sacs at the ends of the airways in the lungs start to break down from many sacs to form much bigger sacs The alveoli are the areas of the lung where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged into and out of the blood Emphysema makes it hard for people to blow air out of the lungs because air gets trapped inside the broken alveoli due to the collapse of the walls There is no cure at the moment for emphysema but treatment includes stopping smoking and taking medicines Sometimes small amounts of oxygen are given to the patient but large amounts can cause problems Sometimes sections of the lungs can collapse causing a pneumothorax where the lung comes away from the walls of the chest This is a medical emergency and needs the patient to go to a hospitals emergency department Emphysema can often lead to the death of the patient 

Oxygen is a chemical element In nature oxygen is a gas with no color or smell Oxygen is a very important element because it is a part of the air people breathe and the water people drink Because of this oxygen supports life All living things need oxygen to live

Oxygen was discovered in 1772 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele first but Joseph Priestley also discovered it two years later and spread the news before Scheele so many people think that Priestley discovered oxygen first The word oxygen comes from Greek words oxus and gennan

Oxygen comes to earth from all parts of the universe in meteorites It is also found in minerals and plants that grow on the earth

Air also contains oxygen Air is made of many gases that are mixed together However oxygen is especially important because all animals use oxygen to get energy from their food

Oxygen is also what makes burning possible This is called combustion When an object or something burns or combusts oxygen combines with another substance and releases heat and light For instance when you burn wood the oxygen in air combines with the wood to create fire This ability of oxygen has many uses But it also makes pure oxygen very dangerous If pure oxygen touches a flame or spark it can combust and cause great damage

Combustion is used in many ways For example when oxygen is mixed with acetylene it can create a very hot flame The hot flame is used in welding where metal is heated and melted together Also oxygen is used to create powerful fuels which also can be used in rockets and jets

Pure oxygen can be produced in several ways In nature plants produce oxygen by using sunlight carbon dioxide and water This process is called photosynthesis Most of the oxygen in the air is produced by photosynthesis

Oxygen can also be created by humans using a process called electrolysis In this process electricity passes through water As a result the water molecules break and release oxygen and hydrogen gas

Blood is a liquid in humans and many animals Blood is pushed through the organism by the heart and brings nutrients and oxygen to our tissues It also takes away waste and carbon dioxide from tissues

Blood is made up of blood plasma and various cells red blood cells white blood cells and platelets Platelets help blood clot Hemoglobin is in red blood cells White blood cells help fight infections and heal wounds

Blood plasma is the yellow liquid where the blood cells float Plasma is made up of nutrients electrolytes gases non protein hormones waste lipids and proteins These proteins are albumin antibodies clotting factors and protein hormones Plasma that does not have the protein fibrinogen is called serum and cannot clot Adults have about 3 liters of plasma Plasma is a liquid mostly water Plasma takes up 55 of blood volume

Another name for red blood cell is erythrocyte Erythro means red cyte means cell RBC is an acronym for red blood cell

Red blood cells carry oxygen and carbon dioxide around our body Cells in our body need oxygen to live Cells also make carbon dioxide as a waste Red blood cells bring more oxygen around the body They also take away the carbon dioxide

RBCs are filled with haemoglobin This is a protein It is made to carry a large amount of oxygen Haemoglobin has iron in it The iron and oxygen gives haemoglobin its red color This is why blood is red Erythropoietin promotes the creation of red blood cells Blood type antigens are carried on the surface of red cells

RBCs also help the blood stay normal pH The blood needs a to be at a pH of 74 If it is much more or less than 74 a person can get very sick or die RBCs are a buffer for the blood pH Buffer means that it stops changes in pH The proteins and the carbon dioxide in the RBC are buffers for the blood If you do not have enough red blood cells you will die

White blood cells are a big part of the immune system They attack things that do not belong in the body They kill germs such as bacteria and viruses They kill cancer cells White blood cells also help to fight other toxic substances

White blood cells find where the germs are and start to destroy them WBCs arrive in the blood They also go out of the blood in places where there is infection WBCs do this to fight the germs that make the infection If they go out of the blood to fight an infection they may return in the lymphatic system So WBCs are in lymph nodes 

Another name for white blood cell is leukocyte Leuko means white cyte means cell WBC is an acronym for white blood cell There are three main kinds of WBCs They are lymphocytes granulocytes and monocytes Some of the WBCs mature into cells which do similar work in the tissues

The different WBCs work in different ways Some WBCs kill and eat germs and cancer cells Some WBCs make antibodies These are proteins that stick to a cell and tell other WBCs to kill it Some WBCs make chemicals They release these chemicals to fight things that do not belong in the body These chemicals cause inflammation in a part of the body When a germ makes someone sick the body shows it If a bacteria gets under someones skin and causes an infection the skin gets red hot and painful This redness heat and pain are signs of inflammation This shows that WBCs are fighting the infection and killing the bacteria

Platelets help make blood clot A clot is when the liquid blood becomes solid The body makes blood clot when the skin is cut This stops blood from going out of the skin too much

For blood to be able to clot is essential But rarely some blood clots are bad If a blood clot happens in a blood vessel going to the brain it can cause a stroke If it happens in a blood vessel going to the heart it can cause a heart attack This does not usually happen to young healthy people 

Platelets are not the only things that make clots There are proteins in the blood that help make clots Both platelets and clotting proteins are needed to make good clots

Blood cells are made in the bone marrow and in the spleen The bone marrow is the soft material in the middle of bones Special cells in the bone marrow make most of the blood cells in your body

Plasma proteins are made mostly by the liver The water and electrolytes in plasma come from the food and water that you eat

The 1980s was the decade that started on January 1 1980 and ended on December 31 1989

This decade is sometimes called the Greed decade in English speaking countries Unlike the 1960s and 1970s this is when the word yuppie was used to describe young urban professionals young adults who lived in cities and started to get good jobs This was also the rise of a more conservative period in these countries Ronald Reagan was president for most of this time in the United States Margaret Thatcher was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Brian Mulroney was Prime Minister of Canada

This decade also saw the Soviet Union fight a war that seemed endless in Afghanistan civil war in Ethiopia and the fall of the Berlin Wall which started the end of the Cold War and of Communism in Eastern Europe 

The eighties are also well known for their extreme fashions such as big hair New Wave punk rock funk or preppies Rap music first started to get big in the 80s and often went with breakdancing in what is now called the old school days Many developments were also made in computer technology during these years and video games became popular

The 1990s was the decade that started on January 1 1990 and ended on December 31 1999 It was the last full decade of both the 20th century and the 2nd millennium

In 1941 16 groups of the national volunteers twenty five battalions and four engineering regiments were created among the Muscovites That November the German Army Group Centre was stopped at the edge of the city and then driven off in the Battle of Moscow Many factories were moved away and much of the government was too and from 20 October the city was declared to be under siege Its people who stayed built and used antitank defences while the city was bombed from the air Joseph Stalin did not to leave the city meaning the general staff remained in the city as well Even though there was a siege going on the building of Moscows metro system continued through the war and by the end of the war a few new metro lines were opened

On 1 May 1944 a medal For the defence of Moscow and in 1947 another medal In memory of the 800th year of Moscow were given to Moscow In commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany on 8 May 1965 Moscow became one of twelve Soviet cities awarded the title of Hero City

In 1980 Moscow hosted the Summer Olympic Games which the United States and several other Western countries did not go to because of the Soviet Unions war in Afghanistan in the end 1979 In 1991 Moscow was the scene of the failed overthrow attempt by the government members opposed to the rules of Mikhail Gorbachev When the USSR ended in the same year Moscow continued to be the capital of Russia

Since then the beginning of a market economy in Moscow has made an explosion of Western style stores services architecture and lifestyles In 1998 it hosted the first World Youth Games

Moscow has many sister cities

The first people who lived on Iceland were Irish monks They came to Iceland around the year 800

In the 9th century Norsemen went to live in Iceland The first Norseman who lived in Iceland was Flki Vilgerarson He was also the one who gave Iceland its name Inglfur Arnarson a chieftain from Norway went to live in South West Iceland He founded the city of Reykjavk

In 930 the Icelandic rulers wrote a constitution They created the Althing a kind of parliament in a place called ingvellir Therefore Iceland is the oldest existing republic

In 985 Erik the Red was sent away from the island because he had killed someone He sailed to the west and discovered Greenland Erics son Leif Ericson discovered America in the year 1000 He called it Vinland The voyages of Eric Leif and others were written down in the sagas

In 1262 Iceland became part of Norway This lasted for 400 years In 1662 it became part of Denmark In the 19th century many Icelanders wanted to be independent from Denmark In 1918 Iceland got many powers of its own but the king of Denmark was still king of Iceland

When Germany took over Denmark on April 9 1940 the Althing decided that Icelanders should rule the country themselves but they did not declare independence yet British and later American soldiers occupied Iceland to prevent it from being attacked by the Germans In 1944 Iceland finally became fully independent

After World War II Iceland became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation but not of the European Union Between 1958 and 1976 there were three debates between Iceland and the United Kingdom about the rights to catch codfish They were called the Cod Wars 

In 1980 Vigds Finnbogadttir was elected president of Iceland She was the first woman ever to be elected president of a country

The people in Iceland are mostly of Scandinavian origin The language they speak is Icelandic The language has not changed much in 1000 years so Icelanders are still able to read the sagas about the Vikings without many problems

Most people in Iceland are Christian Most of them are Lutheran

There are no real surnames on Iceland Children get the first name of their father with sson if its a boy and sdttir if its a girl For example a man named Jn Stefnsson has a son named Fjalar Fjalars last name will not be Stefnsson like his fathers it will become Fjalar Jnsson The same goes for women Jn Stefnssons daughter Kata would not have the last name Stefnsson she would have the name Jnsdttir In most countries people use to call other people by their surname but in Iceland people call other people by their first name So when people talk about Halldr sgrmsson they do not call him sgrmsson but Halldr

Reykjavk is the capital city of Iceland Reykjavk is also the most important port in Iceland Other important towns in Iceland are Akureyri Kpavogur Hafnarfjrur Keflavk and Vestmannaeyjar

Iceland is very geologically active and combined with large amounts of rain and snow caused by the warm waters of the gulf stream current which flow toward it many interesting and unusual geographic features have developed which make it different from any other island so close to the Arctic Circle

Some of these features are Icelands numerous mountains volcanoes hot springs rivers small lakes waterfalls glaciers and geysers The word geyser is in fact derived from Geysir the name of a particularly famous geyser on the southern side of the island Glaciers cover approximately 11 of the island and the largest Vatnajkull is up to 1 km thick and by far the largest glacier in Europe

Iceland though considered to be a European country sits partly in North America since it straddles the Mid Atlantic Ridge which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates The ridge runs directly through the populated Reykjavik and Thingvellir historic areas and the tectonic activity of these plates separating is the source of the abundant geothermal energy in the region

1965 was a common year starting on Friday of the Gregorian calendar

1969 was a common year starting on Wednesday of the Gregorian calendar It was the last year of the 1960s

It is also the capital of the Saarland Saarbrcken has 180000 inhabitants and is on the river Saar

Saarlouis is a city in the Saarland It has 38400 inhabitants and is on the Saar From 1936 to 1945 it was called Saarlautern Ford Motor Company has a plant here it produces the Focus C Max and Kuga

Brandenburg is a state in Germany It has been a state since 1990 It is 29056 km in area and about 26 million inhabitants

Until 1945 it was the biggest province in Prussia with 38278 km and 3 million inhabitants From 1949 to 1952 it was a state in the German Democratic Republic and in 1952 became divided into three Bezirke The capital of Brandenburg is Potsdam

Brandenburg is divided into fourteen Kreise

Also Brandenburg has four Kreisfreie Stdte

Brandenburg is divided into fourteen counties

and four urban districts

Russian is the main language of Russia It is also spoken in other parts of the former Soviet Union It is spoken by many people in Ukraine Belarus Kazakhstan Uzbekistan Tajikistan Kyrgyzstan Moldova Latvia Turkmenistan and Estonia Russian is one of the Slavic languages The Slavic languages belong to the family of Indo European languages Russian is one of the three East Slavic languages The other two are Ukrainian and Belarusian More people speak Russian than any other Slavic language

Russian is the official language of Russia Belarus Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan It is one of the six official languages of the United Nations

Standard Russian is also called modern literary Russian It first appeared at the beginning of the 18th century At that time Peter the Great was working to make the Russian state more modern Standard Russian grew out of the dialect of Russian spoken by people in Moscow and the area around Moscow In some ways Standard Russian was also like the Russian used in government offices in earlier centuries 

Lomonosov put together the first book on Russian grammar in 1755 The Russian Academy of Sciences published the first full dictionary of Russian in 1783 The grammar vocabulary and pronunciation of Russian became stable and were standardized at the end of the 18th and in the 19th century This was the Golden Age of Russian literature Russian literature became famous throughout the world 

All of Russia began to use Russian as its language of literature education and official communication Until the 20th century only the upper classes and people in cities spoke the literary language Russians from the countryside continued to speak their local dialects Starting in the 20th century all children were required to go to school Many people had radios and televisions This helped spread Standard Russian In the 20th century the dialects of Russian mostly disappeared They were gone by the middle of the century Standard Russian replaced them almost completely

In Russian a persons name has three parts These are the first name the second name and the family name 

Parents choose the first name for their child Some common Russian names for boys are Ivan Mikhail and Nikolai Some common Russian names for girls are Anna Anastasia and Yekaterina

The second name is called the patronymic It comes from the first name of ones father The Russian word for this is otechestvo Take for example a boy whose father is named Ivan The boys patronymic is Ivanovich Another example a boys father is named Nikolai The boys patronymic is Nikolaevich If a girls father is named Ivan her patronymic is Ivanovna If her father is named Nikolai her patronymic is Nikolaevna The patronymic of a boy ends with ovich or evich The patronymic of a girl ends with ovna or evna 

Boys have the same family name as their fathers Girls also use their fathers family name but with one difference An a is put on the end of the name Take for example a man with the family name Romanov His sons family name is Romanov His daughters family name is Romanova 

Another example A mans name is Nikolai Alexandrovich Romanov He has a son named Aleksei and a daughter named Anastasia The sons full name is Aleksei Nikolaevich Romanov The daughters full name is Anastasia Nikolaevna Romanova

There are also many people in Russia with family names that are not Russian Some of these names have only one form That means the family name is the same for sons and daughters Some examples are Glushko Rubinstein or Shevardnadze

Like Latin and some other languages Russian has a case system In Russian the case system applies to nouns pronouns adjectives numerals and participles The case system is a set of word endings that show the grammatical roles of words in a sentence Because the grammatical roles are shown by the endings the order of words in a sentence is more free in Russian than for example in English There are six cases in Russian The nominative case which is the form listed in the dictionary is used for the grammatical subject of the sentence The genitive case often shows ownership The accusative case is used for a direct object the dative case for an indirect object The instrumental case is used for the tool or instrument with which something is done The prepositional case is used after certain prepositions such as in and on but other prepositions may require the use of other cases Each of the cases has other uses besides the basic ones just listed

In Russian nouns have one of three genders masculine feminine or neuter Masculine nouns usually end in consonants neuter nouns usually end in o or e and feminine nouns usually end in a or  There is also the plural which acts much like a fourth gender  when a word is made into the plural its gender does not matter as far as the case system is concerned

1978 was a common year starting on Sunday of the Gregorian calendar

1982 was a common year starting on Friday of the Gregorian calendar

A professor is a person who teaches at a college or university A professor is someone who also studies subjects and helps to discover new ideas This is called doing research

Slope means an area of ground that tends evenly upward or downward or the degree to which a surface tends upward or downward

In mathematics slope means the ratio of the vertical and horizontal distances between two points on a line

California is a large state in the western United States It is the third largest state by area only Alaska and Texas have more land It has more people than any other US state Its most famous cities are Los Angeles and San Francisco The capital is Sacramento

The current governor of California is Edmund G Jerry Brown Brown had also been governor from 1975 to 1983 so he is both the youngest and the oldest governor of the state

California is represented by two senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein

The state is a leader in three businesses farming movie making and high technology namely software and Web sites Aerospace used to be a large industry there but has been downsized in the last 20 years

There are many earthquakes in California They occur when two earth crusts shift underground Californians need to be prepared for earthquakes and often store extra food water flashlights and first aid supplies in case of such an emergency

California has more people than any other state in the United States If California was a separate country it would have the sixth largest economy in the world California is probably the state with the most ethnic groups Because of its large size it also probably has the most geographic features mountains deserts coasts than any other state in America It is often called The Golden State possibly because of the Gold Rush back in 1849 Also some grasses become golden during the summertime and the state flower is the golden poppy The post office uses CA as a shorthand for California and the Associated Press uses Calif or Cali

California is a major power in American culture as well as the business life of the nation Many of the great changes in technology and law came from California and the state pays more to the US government than it gets back It also has some of the countrys largest cities such as Los Angeles San Diego San Jose and San Francisco

In the past the whole area we now call California was not just todays California but also covered the Mexican lands south of it as well as Nevada Utah and parts of Arizona and Wyoming The Spaniards called the part of the territory that eventually became part of the United States Alta California when it was split from what became Baja California In these early times the borders of the Sea of Cortez and the Pacific coast were not well known so the old maps wrongly showed California to be an island The name comes from Las sergas de Espladin a 16th century book by Garci Rodrguez de Montalvo where there is an island paradise called California 

The first European who visited parts of the coast Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo came from Portugal in 1542 just fifty years after Christopher Columbus made his first trip The first European who saw the entire coast was Sir Francis Drake in 1579 and he decided that the British owned it But starting in the late 1700s Spanish religious leaders of the Roman Catholic Church got large gifts of land in the area north of Baja California from the Spanish king and queen These religious people set up small towns and villages the famous California Missions When Mexico was no longer controlled by Spain the Mexican government took over the villages and they soon emptied out

In 1846 as the Mexican American War was starting some Americans in California hoped to create a California Republic These men flew a Bear flag that had a golden bear with a star on it This Republic ended suddenly however when Commodore John D Sloat of the United States Navy sailed into San Francisco Bay He said that California was now part of the United States After the war with Mexico ended California was split between the two countries The Mexican portion became the Mexican states of Baja California Norte and Baja California Sur The western part of the part given to the United States became todays state of California

In 1848 there were about 4000 Spanish speaking people in todays California on the American side In 1849 gold was suddenly found and the number of people went up very fast as the Gold Rush took hold In 1850 California became a state in the Union

During the American Civil War many people in California especially in the southern part of California thought the South was right Some people in Southern California even wanted Southern California to leave the rest of the state and join the Confederate State of America However this did not happen California joined the war effort on the side of the North and sent many troops east to fight the Confederacy At first travel between the far west and the east coast of the United States was dangerous and took a lot of time Going by land was very difficult because there were no roads and no trains and many Native Americans were attacking American settlers heading West in wagons The only other way was to travel by boat around the Cape Horn at the southern end of South America This took months since the trip was thousands of miles long and the Panama Canal had not yet been built either But in 1869 the connection got better quickly because the first railroad across the continent was finished Meanwhile more people in California were learning that the land there was very good to grow fruit and other crops Oranges were grown in many parts of California This was the beginning of the huge farming business that California has today

In 1900 there were only a million people in California and 100000 in Los Angeles Today California has more people than any other US state Starting in 1965 the variety of people became much greater as many different people from around the world came to the United States and often decided to live in California California is considered to be a liberal state but there are still a lot of people who are Republicans Technology is very advanced and many new cultural trends begin there Engineering and computers play a big part in the states life For over a hundred years film has been one of the most important businesses in California By the 1950s television had also become an important business in California

Propaganda is information It is always biased The information is designed to make people feel a certain way or to believe a certain thing The information is often political 

It is hard to tell whether the information is true or false Very often the information is confusing and unfair Propaganda does tend to make disputes last longer and be more difficult to resolve

The word propaganda comes from Latin At first it meant ideas to be spread around But in the First World War it came to mean political ideas that are supposed to be misleading

Propaganda is like advertising in some ways For example it uses the mass media to spread its ideas But advertising is usually trying to sell something whereas propaganda is about ideas It is often political and used by states or political parties not private companies

Propaganda is often used during wars There it can be very useful It can take the form of posters TV advertisements and radio announcements Sometimes it keeps the people of a country happy  telling them that their country is fighting well and telling them how important it is that the enemy is defeated Sometimes it tries to make people hate the enemy The information could tell people that the enemy is evil or make them seem not human Sometimes a government gives propaganda to the enemy  telling them that the war is going badly for them and that they should stop fighting

When a country is not at war propaganda can still be used The government may use propaganda to change what people think about a political situation A group may try to change the way people act towards an issue

Propaganda under some countries like dictatorships is used along with censorship While propaganda tries to give people false ideas censorship forces the ones who disagree with propaganda to keep quiet Then the propaganda can say everything because nobody can question it in public

Propaganda is also used to win people by tricking them Some people say that cults use propaganda to get people to join them

Examples for propaganda

Propaganda has been used in every known civilisation It was used by Rameses II on his monuments in Ancient Egypt it was used by Ancient Greek orators it was used by Julius Caesar and all Roman Emperors The word itself is formed from propagate meaning to multiply 

A landmark in propaganda was the Inquisition founded in the 12th century This was reinforced by the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith of the Catholic Church This committee founded in 1622 by Pope Gregory XV had action branches in most European countries These were the local branches of the Inquisition which sought out heretics With torture and the threat of death by burning at the stake they forced heretics to recant The objective was to remove all challenges to the supremacy of the Church in matters of belief

A 1578 handbook for inquisitors spelled out the purpose of inquisitorial penalties quoniam punitio non refertur primo per se in correctionem bonum eius qui punitur sed in bonum publicum ut alij terreantur a malis committendis avocentur Translation from the Latin for punishment does not take place primarily and per se for the correction and good of the person punished but for the public good in order that others may become terrified and weaned away from the evils they would commit Therefore the purpose was truly propaganda in the modern sense

Topology is the study of how spaces are organized how the objects are structured in terms of position It also studies how spaces are connected It is divided into algebraic topology differential topology and geometric topology

Topology has sometimes been called rubber sheet geometry because in topology there is no difference between a circle and a square but there is a difference between a circle and a figure eight The spaces studied in topology are called topological spaces They vary from familiar manifolds to some very exotic constructions

In many problems we often divide a large space into smaller areas for instance a house is divided into rooms a nation into states a type of quantity into numbers etc Each of these smaller areas is next to other small areas and the places where the areas meet are connections If we write down on paper a list of spaces and the connections between them we have written down a description of a space  a topological space All topological spaces have the same properties and are made of the same structure This makes it easier to study how spaces behave in general and to use general algorithms For instance to program a robot to navigate a house we simply give it a list of rooms the connections between each room and an algorithm that can determine the sequence of rooms to travel through to reach any other desired room

We can go further by creating subdivisions of subdivisions of space For instance a nation divided into states divided into counties divided into city boundaries etc All this kind of information can be described using topology

Los Angeles is a city in southern California in the United States of America There are 3847400 people living in the city and over 18 million people in the LA region The city has an area of 1200 square kilometres LA has the second largest population of any city in the USA the first being New York City It is the largest city in California

The name Los Angeles comes from the Spanish language and it means the Angels The name is an abbreviation from the original name of the place The original name is El Pueblo de Nuestra Seora la Reina de los ngeles de Porciuncula Los Angeles was founded in 1781 The area had earlier been explored by two Franciscan priests named Junipero Serra and Juan Crespi when California still belonged to Spain On April 4 1850 California became a State of the USA Los Angeles began to grow rapidly from when the railroad came in the 1870s up until the 1930s Los Angeles was home to the Olympic Games in 1932 and 1984 Twice the city broke out in riots in 1965 and 1992 both caused by anger between people and the city police In 1994 an earthquake killed 72 people and hurt many buildings

Los Angeles is a very large city and the edges of the city are very far from the center going from the beaches to the mountains The Santa Monica Mountains run through the city separating it into the San Fernando Valley to the north and the Los Angeles Basin to the south The Los Angeles River also runs through the city some convert51mikm

The climate in Los Angeles is a Mediterranean climate The weather is usually warm and dry during the summer and it is cool and rainy in the winter The weather is different depending on how far away from the ocean you are so places near the beach usually do not get as hot in the summer It is very rare for temperatures to go below freezing The city receives about 15 inches of rain each year although the amount can change a lot from year to year

LA has many famous sights There are many very long beaches such as Venice Beach Many visitors go to Hollywood home to the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the Manns Chinese Theater a large cinema Los Angeles also has many fine museums such as the LA County Museum of Art and the Getty Museum

Los Angeles is known for its large movie and television industry Much of this is located in Hollywood Some military aircraft are also made there The music industry is also concentrated in the area The city is also a banking center The San Pedro area has a busy port

Los Angeles has dozens of neighborhoods and named areas including

The current mayor of Los Angeles is Antonio Villaraigosa

A census means getting information about every member of a population Usually used meaning a population of people but can be used to mean a population of animals The United States has a census every 10 years or decade

FilePismis 24jpgthumbright260pxHome to some of the largest stars known the open stellar cluster Pismis 24 is in the nebula NGC 6357 Several stars in the clusters have over 100 times the mass of the Sun The strange shapes taken by the clouds are a result of the vast radiation emitted by these massive hot stars 

This image combines observations with three different filters in visible light with the 15 metre Danish telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory in Chile

A star is a massive ball of plasma held together by gravity It radiates because of the nuclear reactions inside it

It radiates heat and light and every other part of the electromagnetic spectrum such as radio waves microwaves X rays gamma rays UV The proportions vary according to the mass and age of the star

The energy of stars comes from nuclear fusion  a process of turning one chemical element into another Most stars are mostly made of hydrogen and helium They turn the hydrogen into helium When a star is near the end of its life it begins to change the helium into other chemical elements like carbon and oxygen Fusion produces a lot of energy The energy makes the star very hot The energy produced by stars radiates away from them It is electromagnetic radiation 

A star begins as a collapsing cloud of material composed primarily of hydrogen with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements Once the stellar core is sufficiently dense some of the hydrogen is steadily converted into helium through the process of nuclear fusion The remainder of the stars interior carries energy away from the core through a combination of radiative and convective processes The stars radiation pressure prevents it from collapsing further under its own gravity Once the hydrogen fuel at the core is exhausted those stars with at least 04 times the mass of the Sun expand to become a red giant in some cases fusing heavier elements The star then evolves into a degenerate form putting out a portion of its matter into space There it forms a new generation of stars with a higher proportion of heavy elements

The star nearest to Earth is the Sun It is not accurate to say most of the energy on Earth comes from it It is more accurate to say the energy of sunlight supports almost all life on Earth by photosynthesis and drives Earths climate and weather The Earth has its own source of heat in its interior see Age of the Earth The internal heat comes from the original gravitational formation of the Earth and from the radioactive materials inside it

We can see other stars in the night sky when the Sun goes down They are made mostly of hydrogen and a little bit of helium plus other elements The sun is such a star

Most stars look like shiny dots from Earth because they are far away Our Sun is the closest star to us The earth moves around the Sun in an oval shape The Sun and all things that orbit it are called the Solar System Many other stars sometimes have planets orbiting them too Scientists have found other planets moving around other stars but no planets that they have found are similar to Earth

The nearest star to our Solar System and the second nearest star to Earth after the Sun is Proxima Centauri It is 399 trillion kilometres away This is 42 light years away meaning that light from Proxima Centauri takes 42 years to reach Earth

Astronomers think there are a very large number of stars in the Universe They estimate that there are at least 70 sextillion stars That is 70000000000000000000000 which is about 230 billion times the number of stars in the Milky Way 

Most stars are very old They are usually thought to be between 1 and 10 billion years old The oldest stars are thought to be around 137 billion years old Scientists think that is close to the age of the Universe

Stars vary greatly in size The smallest neutron stars are no bigger than a city The neutron star is incredibly dense If you were to take a layer a micron thick and apply it onto a tank it would be a very tough armor The tank would be so heavy it would sink into the center of the Earth 

Supergiant stars are the largest objects in the Universe They have a diameter about 1500 times bigger than the Sun If you changed the sun into one of these supergiant stars down where the sun is its outer surface would reach between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn and the earth would be inside the star The star Betelgeuse in the Orion constellation is a red supergiant star

When seen in the night sky without a telescope some stars appear brighter than other stars This difference is measured in terms of apparent magnitude There are two reasons for stars to differ in apparent magnitude If one star is much closer than another otherwise similar star it will appear much brighter in just the same way that a candle that is near looks brighter than a big fire that is far away If one star is much larger or much hotter than another star at about the same distance it will appear much brighter in just the same way that if two fires are the same distance away the bigger or hotter one will look brighter

Beside light stars also give off a solar wind and neutrinos These are very small particles

Stars are a source of a gravity field This is what keeps planets close to them It is also not unusual for two stars to orbit each other This happens when they are close together This is also because of gravity in the same way as the Earth orbits the Sun These binary stars are thought to be very common There are even groups of three or more stars orbiting each other Proxima Centauri is the smallest star in a group of three

Stars are not spread evenly across all of space They are grouped into galaxies A typical galaxy contains hundreds of billions of stars

Stars have been important to civilizations around the world through history They have been part of religious practices and long ago many people believed that stars could never die Astronomers organized stars into constellations and used them to see the motions of the planets and guess the position of the Sun The motion of the Sun with the stars was used to make calendars to keep track of agricultural practices The Gregorian calendar which is used almost everywhere in the world is a solar calendar

People think that stars are made in nebulas These are big areas of slightly higher density than normal space 

When very big stars die they explode This is called a supernova When a supernova happens in a nebula it becomes unstable This makes parts of the nebula collapse Stars form in these collapsed areas The Orion Nebula is an example of a place where stars form

Stars spend about 90 of their lives fusing hydrogen to produce helium in high pressure reactions near the core Such stars are said to be on the main sequence 

Small stars burn their fuel very slowly and might last tens to hundreds of billions of years At the end of their lives they become dimmer and dimmer 

Because most stars use up their supply of hydrogen their outer layers expand and cool to form a red giant Eventually the core is compressed enough to start helium fusion and the star heats up and contracts 

An average size star will then shed its outer layers as a planetary nebula The core that remains will be a tiny ball of degenerate matter not heavy enough for further fusion to take place supported only by its own pressure called a white dwarf It will fade into a black dwarf over very very long stretches of time 

In larger stars fusion continues until collapse ends up causing the star to explode in a supernova This is the only cosmic process that happens on human timescales historically supernovae have been observed as new stars where none existed before Most of the matter in a star is blown away in the explosion but what remains will collapse into a neutron star or in the case of the largest stars a black hole 

The blown off outer layers include heavy elements which are often converted into new stars andor planets The flowing out of the gas from supernovae and the stellar wind of large stars play an important part in shaping the interstellar medium

DUI can mean

Drunk driving is the act of driving a motor vehicle while under the effects of alcohol Drunk driving is illegal in most areas of the world In some places driving a motorless vehicle such as a bicycle while drunk is also illegal

Most areas that make laws started with DWI laws banning just alcohol Later most changed them to DUI laws adding other drugs to those banned while driving The most common blood alcohol content limit in the United States is 008 for the legal meaning of drunk Only three states still use the more lax original standard of 010 Many jurisdictions add extra penalties in cases where the drivers BAC is over 020

The first place in the United States to adopt laws against drunk driving was the state of New York in 1910 with California and others doing the same later Early laws simply banned driving while drunk with no mention of what BAC was banned The state of Georgia was one of the last states to make laws against drunk driving One of the years with the most alcohol related crashes was 1982 The year 1982 had 26173 alcohol related deaths due to drunk driving

In the US most of the laws were greatly tightened in the early 1980s largely due to pressure from groups like Mothers Against Drunk Drivers and Young Adults Educating Responsible Drinking

HyperText Markup Language is a markup language for creating webpages Webpages are usually viewed in a web browser They can include writing links pictures and even sound and video HTML is used to mark and describe each of these kinds of content so the web browser can show them right

HTML can also be used to add meta information to a webpage Meta information is information about the web page For example the name of the person who made it Meta information is not usually shown by web browsers

Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript can be included in HTML code CSS is used to change how a webpage looks JavaScript is used to add features to webpages and make them more interactive

HTML was made by the World Wide Web Consortium There are many versions of HTML The current standard is HTML 401 So it is the version the W3C recommends A newer version called HTML5 will become standard within the next few years The W3C also develops XHTML This is another markup language which is very similar to HTML but more strict

HTML uses special bits of programming language called tags to let the browser know how a webpage should look The tags usually come in pairs an opening tag to tell the browser when to start doing something and an ending tag to tell the browser when to stop doing something There are many different kinds of tags and each one has a different purpose

Opening tags have a keyword such as p surrounded by angle brackets For example the tag tells the browser the start a new paragraph Ending tags look almost exactly the same only they have a forward slash added just before the keyword For example the tag tells the browser to end a paragraph A small number of tags like and can be used without an ending tag

Some tags only work in certain browsers For example the tag which is used to make a bit of writing slide across the page only works in the Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox browsers Other browsers simply ignore this tag and display the writing normally Many web page creators avoid using these non standard tags because they want their pages to look the same with all browsers

The W3C is making a new version of HTML called HTML5 with more features and better support for things like online video HTML5 is expected to become the standard version of HTML within the next few years

Some of the new features in HTML5 are

In addition some features of HTML4 have been left out of HTML5 For example the tag which is used to change how text looks on a page is not available in HTML5 The W3C recommends doing this with CSS instead

Currently no browsers completely support all of HTML5s new features However some of the features are supported by Mozilla Firefox Google Chrome and Apple Safari

A leg is something used to support things to hold them up Birds and humans have two legs Some objects for example tables and chairs also have legs to hold them up

Poland is a country in Central Europe It is next to Germany to the west the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south Ukraine and Belarus to the east and the Baltic Sea Lithuania and Russia to the north The total land area of Poland is about 312679 km2 This makes Poland the 77th largest country in the world with over 385 million people Most Polish people live in large cities including the capital Warsaw d Cracow the second capital of Poland Szczecin Gdask Wrocaw and Pozna

The word Poland was written officially for the first time in 966 In 1569 Poland formed a strong union with Lithuania called the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth The Commonwealth collapsed in 1795 and the Polish people did not have a nation for 123 years Poland regained its independence in 1918 after World War I but lost it again in World War II Several years later Poland became a communist country within the Eastern Bloc under control of the former Soviet Union

In 1989 Poland stopped being a communist country and became a liberal democracy On May 1 2004 Poland joined the European Union Poland is also a member of NATO the United Nations and the World Trade Organization

The first sign of humans in Polish land is from 500000 years ago The Bronze Age started around 2400 2300 BC The Iron Age started around 750 700 BC At that time the Polish lands were under the influence of the Lusatian culture About year 400 BC Celtic and Germanic tribes lived there Those people had trade contacts with the Roman Empire

With time Slavs came to Polish lands Some of those Slavs later called western stayed there and started to create new countries The most powerful tribe were called the Polans and this is where the name Poland comes from

Poland began to form into a country around the middle of the 10th century in the Piast dynasty In 966 Prince Mieszko I became a Christian and so the Polish people also became Christians The next king was Bolesaw I of Poland He conquered many lands and he became first King of Poland Casimir I of Poland changed the Polish capital from Gniezno to Krakw In the 12th century Poland broke into some smaller states after the death of King Bolesaw III Wrymouth in 1138 because of his will Those states were later attacked by Mongol armies in 1241 which slowed action to unite these small states into the big country of Poland This happened eighty years later in 1320 when Wadysaw I became the King of the united Poland His son Casimir III the Great repaired the Polish economy built new castles and won the war against the Ruthenian Dukedom Also many people emigrated to Poland became a haven for emigrating people A large number of Jewish people also moved into Poland during that time The Black Death which affected many parts of Europe from 1347 to 1351 did not come to Poland

After death of last Piast on Polish throne Casimir III Louis I of Hungary and his daughter Jadwiga of Poland started to rule She got married to the Lithuanian prince Jogaila Their marriage started a new dynasty in Poland the Jagiellon dynasty Under the Jagiellon dynasty Poland made an alliance with its neighbour Lithuania

In the 17th century Sweden attacked almost all of Poland Many wars against the Ottoman Empire Russia Cossacks Transylvania and Brandenburg Prussia ended in 1699 During the following 80 years the government and nation were weaker making Poland dependent on Russia Russian tsars took advantage of this by offering money to dishonest members of the Polish government who would block new ideas and solutions Russia Prussia and Austria broke Poland into three pieces in 1772 1793 and 1795 which dissolved the country Before the second split a Constitution called The Constitution of 3 May was made in 1791 The Polish people did not like the new kings and often rebelled Napoleon made another Polish state the Duchy of Warsaw but after the Napoleonic wars Poland was split again by the countries at the Congress of Vienna The eastern part was ruled by the Russian tsar During World War I all the Allies agreed to save Poland Soon after the surrender of Germany in November 1918 Poland became the Second Polish Republic It got its freedom after several military conflicts the largest was in 1919 1921 Polish Soviet War

On September 1 1939 World War II started when Nazi Germany attacked Poland and the Soviet Union attacked on September 17 Warsaw was defeated on September 28 and Poland was split up into two pieces one half owned by Nazi Germany the other by the Soviet Union More than 6 million Polish people died and half of these people were Jewish Most of these deaths were part of the Holocaust in which 6 million Jews were killed At the wars end Polands borders were moved west pushing the east border to the Curzon line The west border was moved to the Oder Neisse line The new Poland became 20 smaller by 77500 square kilometers The shift forced millions of Poles Germans Ukrainians and Jews to move

England was named after a Danish tribe called the Angles who settled in Central Northern and Eastern England in the 5th century A related tribe called the Saxons settled in the south of England That is why that period of English history is called Anglo Saxon For the majority of this time England did not exist as a united country The Anglo Saxons lived in many small kingdoms which slowly united

England became one country in 937 The first King of England was Athelstan but he lost a lot of England to Danish invaders who formed their own country in the East and North Many villages and towns in this area still have Danish names and use some Danish based words At one time Wessex was the only English kingdom left After many battles King Alfred of Wessex became king of the whole of England and the old kingdoms just became provinces called Earldoms governed by an Earl Soon after Alfred died the king of Denmark ruled England

England soon had an English king again When King Edward died Harold became king William the Conqueror Duke of Normandy said that Harold had promised to make William the king so he invaded England and fought King Harold at the Battle of Hastings in 1066

The religion of England used to be Roman Catholicism The bishops of England and all their churches obeyed the pope and the church in Rome Italy Many of the bishops did not agree with this In the 1500s the Pope told King Henry VIII that he could not divorce his wife King Henry VIII created the Church of England so that he could divorce his wife and made it the official church in England For the next 200 years there was fighting over whether the King of England should be Roman Catholic or Protestant 

Queen Elizabeth I was Henrys second daughter She was a powerful queen who ruled for more than 40 years When Queen Elizabeth I died she had no children and in 1603 James I of Scotland became King James I of England He called his two countries Great Britain but they were still separate countries with their own parliaments and laws even though they had the same King

James son Charles I and the English Parliament fought each other in the English Civil War Oliver Cromwell became leader of the Parliamentary Army and defeated the Royalist Army King Charles was beheaded in 1649 and Oliver Cromwell became dictator When Cromwell died his son Richard was not strong enough to rule and King Charles II the son of Charles I was invited to come to England and be king in 1660

When King Charles II died his brother James II was the next king A lot of people did not like James because he was Roman Catholic England was invaded by William of Orange Many people welcomed William because he was a Protestant James left the country without a fight and Parliament asked William and Mary to become King and Queen together When Mary died William ruled alone Queen Marys sister Anne became the next queen While she was queen England and Scotland were officially joined as one country in 1707 and lost their separate parliaments The parliament in London now included Scottish MPs and was called the British parliament

After this the history of England becomes the history of Great Britain and United Kingdom

The United Kingdom was formed in 1800 when the Irish Parliament merged with the British one Later Ireland fought against this merging and the Republic of Ireland which is not quite the whole island called Ireland became a separate country The rest of the island Northern Ireland is now the only part of Ireland still in the UK England is the only state of UK not to have its own government Parliament or Assembly but to be Governed by Parliament of the United Kingdom

Scotland was once an independent country with its own monarch but is now one of the four countries that make up the United Kingdom In 1603 the King of Scotland James VI became King of England too because Queen Elizabeth I of England had no children and James was her nearest relative 

In 1707 the parliament of Scotland joined with the parliament of England to become the parliament of Great Britain and in 1801 Great Britain joined with Ireland to become United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland 

Even though Scotland is not independent throughout history it has had its own legal system and culture Since 1999 Scotland has had its own parliament but it is not as powerful as the British parliament in Westminster Many things are still controlled by the United Kingdom parliament

The history of Scotland begins around 10000 years ago when humans first began to live in Scotland after the end of the last ice age Of the Stone Age Bronze Age and Iron Age civilization that existed in the country many fossils remain but no written records were left behind These people did not have writing

The written history of Scotland begins when the Roman Empire came to Britain and the Romans invaded what is now England and Wales calling it Britannia To the north was Caledonia land not owned by the Romans Its people were the Picts This meant the Scottish were not affected by the Romans in the same way the English were The sea was very important for trade reasons 

Because of the where Scotland is in the world and its strong reliance on trade routes by sea the nation held close links in the south and east with the Baltic countries and through Ireland with France and Europe Following the Acts of Union and Industrial Revolution Scotland grew to be one of the largest commercial intellectual and industrial states in Europe

The Wars of Scottish Independence were many military campaigns fought between Scotland and England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries

The First War began with the English invasion of Scotland in 1296 and ended with the signing of the Treaty of Edinburgh Northampton in 1328 The Second War began with the English supported invasion of Scotland by Edward Balliol and the Disinherited in 1332 and ended around 1357 with the signing of the Treaty of Berwick 

The wars were part of a great national crisis for Scotland and the period became one of the most important moments in the nations history At the end of both wars Scotland still was a free and independent country which was its main aim throughout the conflict The wars were also important for other reasons such as the invention of the longbow as an important weapon in medieval warfare

A series of deaths in the line of succession in the 1280s followed by King Alexander IIIs death in 1286 left the Scottish crown in crisis His granddaughter Margaret the Maid of Norway a four year old girl was the heir

Edward I of England as Margarets great uncle suggested that his son and Margaret should marry stabilising the Scottish line of succession In 1290 Margarets guardians agreed to this but Margaret herself died in Orkney on her voyage from Norway to Scotland of sea sickness before she was made Queen or her marriage could take place

Because there was no clear heir to the throne anymore the Scottish people decided to ask Edward I of England to choose their king The strongest candidate was called Robert Bruce Robert Bruce had castles all around the country and had a private army But Edward wanted to invade Scotland so he chose the weaker candidate who was John Balliol He had the strongest claim to the throne and became king on 30 November 1292 Robert Bruce decided to accept this decision

Over the next few years Edward I kept trying to undermine both the authority of King John and the independence of Scotland In 1295 John on the recommendation of his chief councillors entered into an alliance with France This was the beginning of the Auld Alliance

In 1296 Edward invaded Scotland He removed King John from power and put him in jail The following year William Wallace and Andrew de Moray raised an army from the southern and northern parts of the country to fight the English Under their joint leadership an English army was defeated at the Battle of Stirling Bridge For a short time Wallace ruled Scotland in the name of John Balliol as Guardian of the realm

Edward came north in person and defeated Wallace at the Battle of Falkirk in 1298 Wallace escaped but resigned as Guardian of Scotland John Comyn and Robert the Bruce were put in his place In 1305 Wallace was captured by the English who executed him for treason Wallace claimed he did not commit treason as he was not loyal to England

In February 1306 Robert Bruce murdered John Comyn a leading rival in a church Bruce went on to take the crown but Edwards army overran the country yet again after defeating Bruces small army at the Battle of Methven Despite the excommunication of Bruce and his followers by Pope Clement V his support slowly strengthened and by 1314 with the help of leading nobles such as Sir James Douglas and the Earl of Moray only the castles at Bothwell and Stirling were still under English control 

Edward I died in Carlisle in 1307 His heir Edward II moved an army north to break the siege of Stirling Castle and again take control Robert defeated that army at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 securing temporary independence In 1320 a letter to the Pope from the nobles of Scotland went part of the way towards convincing Pope John XXII to overturn the earlier excommunication and cancel the various acts of submission by Scottish kings to English ones so that Scotlands independence could be recognised by other European countries

In 1326 the first full Parliament of Scotland met The parliament was made from an earlier council of nobility and clergy around 1235 but in 1326 representatives of the burghs the burgh commissioners joined them to form the Three Estates

In 1328 Edward III signed the Treaty of Northampton which declared Scottish independence under the rule of Robert the Bruce Four years after Roberts death in 1329 England invaded Scotland yet again looking to put the Rightful King Edward Balliol son of John Balliol to the Scottish throne starting the Second War of Independence In the face of tough Scottish resistance led by Sir Andrew Murray attempts to secure Balliol on the throne failed Edward III lost interest in Balliol after the outbreak of the Hundred Years War with France In 1341 David II King Roberts son and heir was able to return from temporary exile in France Balliol finally resigned his empty claim to the throne to Edward in 1356 before retiring to Yorkshire where he died in 1364

The population is made up of 52 Unionists and 48 Nationalists at the moment

Sometimes people use other names for Northern Ireland Unionists sometimes call it Ulster but this is not correct as three counties of Ulster are in the Republic of Ireland Nationalists sometimes call it the north or the six counties because they do not want to recognise the existence that a part of Ireland is in the United Kingdom 

English is spoken by almost everyone in Northern Ireland Another important language is Irish and a language known as Ulster Scots which comes from Eastern Ulster and Lowland Scotland The Irish language became extinct in the 20th century but a revival backed by Foras na Gaeilge has led to some usage especially in Belfast the Glens of Antrim and counties Tyrone and Fermanagh This revival has been driven largely through the creation of Irish language schools The Irish language is spoken by some nationalist people Ulster Scots is almost exclusive to areas of Belfast and mid Antrim

Some languages like Chinese Urdu or Polish are becoming more common in Northern Ireland as people from other countries move to Northern Ireland

Since the Belfast Agreement of Friday 10 April 1998 there has been mainly peace between the two sides of the community This agreement was agreed by most of the people in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland as well as the Irish and British governments It allows for the self government of Northern Ireland and greater North South co operation and co operation between Britain and the Republic of Ireland Additionally it makes clear the right of the people of Northern Ireland to decide their constitutional future and select whether they are British or Irish citizens

Everton Football Club or Everton FC are an English football club from the city of Liverpool The club currently competes in the Premier League and have played more seasons in the top league of English football than any other team 

Everton were founded in 1878 They have a long rivalry with Liverpool whose ground is nearby When they play each other the match known as a Merseyside derby In the 1890s Everton played at Anfield Liverpools stadium But the owner of the stadium put the rent up so much the club decided to leave and build their own instead Everton were then based at a new stadium called Goodison Park They still play there today 

Many famous players have played at Everton including the English World Cup winning Alan Ball and legendary goal scorer William Dixie Dean Dean still holds the record for most goals in one season scoring 60 in the 19271928 season

Everton entered the FA Cup in the 188687 season They were beaten 1 0 by Rangers in the first round As football became more and more popular around England the clubs realised they needed an organised league In 1888 the Football League was founded Everton were one of the 12 founding members Preston North End won the first two leagues and Everton won the third in 1891 They won their second ever trophy the FA Cup in 1905 but did not win another until 1916 It was not until 1927 that Everton had their first period of long success In 1925 they signed Dixie Dean and in 1927 he scored 60 goals in 39 games setting a new world record and taking Everton to another league title Everton were relegated or sent down to a the second division in 19301931 Within a year they were promoted again and the club has not been relegated again since This makes them the English football team with the most consecutive seasons in the top league of English football 

Evertons second successful period came after 1961 when Harry Catterick was given the job of manager With Catterick in charge Everton won two league titles and four cups between 1961 and 1970 This success did not last however and after three years of low league finishes Catterick quit his job The club finished in middle of the table or mid table positions for the rest of the 1970s with a line of unsuccessful managers In 1981 the club appointed Howard Kendall to be the new manager He turned Everton around and eventually became the most successful manager in the clubs history winning two league titles and three cups between 1981 and 1987 This era also brought Evertons one and only European trophy win the Cup Winners Cup in 1985 The semi final saw Everton beat German champions Bayern Munich 3 1 a match voted the greatest of all time at Goodison Park The final saw another 3 1 win for Everton against Rapid Vienna crowning them European Cup Winners Cup Champions their first and only european title to date

In 1987 several Liverpool and 39 Juventus fans died when the crowd started fighting at a stadium in Heysel Germany UEFA decided that Liverpool fans were mainly to blame Because of this all English clubs were not allowed to play against European teams untl 1991 This denied Everton the chance to defend their European title and the team gradually broke up selling many of their best players to other European clubs The club did not do very well in the early 90s nearly getting relegated twice and going through lots of money problems However they still became one of the first members of the new English Premier League when it started in 1992 They were quite successful under a manager called Joe Roylewho took over in 1994 In his second season in charge he kept Everton clear of relegation and won the FA cup the clubs first trophy in seven years The club had steady improvement under Royle finishing 6th and 7th in the 1996 and 1997 seasons 

After two seasons however the clubs performance went downhill and Kendall was sacked after only narrowly avoiding relegation in the 1998199 season Former player Walter Smith took over for three reasons but failed to perform spending a lot of money but not getting the team to good league positions David Moyes took over in 2002 and has been one of the clubs most successful managers to date Under his management the club has become a regular top 10 side finishing 4th in 2005 their highest ever Premier League finish 

Under his management Wayne Rooney was brought into the first team and he was quickly sold to Manchester United for 27 million a club record fee Since 2005 Everton have enjoyed regular top 8 finishes and reached the last 16 of the UEFA Cup in 2007 and the FA Cup final in 2009

Everton usually wear royal blue shirts with white shorts and blue socks 

They wore many different kit colours in their first few years At first they wore white shorts and white shirts with blue stripes However many players who moved to Everton still wore the shirts of their old team so things quickly got confusing To solve this the club introduced an all black kit to the club as black dye was cheap and easily available However many fans thought this was quite boring and slightly broken wikt linkmorbidmorbid so a red band was added across the chest It was not until the 190102 season that the colours of royal blue and white were first introduced This kit has stayed with a few small changes almost exactly the same from then until the present day It was changed for one year in 1986 to light blue but the fans did not like this at all and it was quickly changed back again

Evertons current shirt sponsor is a beer maker from Thailand Chang Beer Previous shirt sponsors have included electronics company NEC and food maker Danka Everton were the first Premier League team to take off shirt sponsors from their child shirts because they did not like advertising alcohol to children

Evertons nickname is the Toffees or sometimes the Toffeemen This comes from one of two toffee shops that were near their stadium at the time the club started Both Ye Anciente Everton Toffee House and Old Mother Nobletts Toffee Shop claim to have started off the nickname At first Ye Anciente Everton Toffee House was very popular with fans because it was near to their stadium However when the club moved to Goodison Park they became close to Old Mother Nobletts Toffee Shop There they sold sweets called Everton mints which proved even more popular Faced with going out of business Ye Anciente Everton Toffee House got a licence to throw free toffees to the crowd inside the ground before the match This tradition continues even today A teenage girl is chosen from the crowd to throw toffees to the crowd before the match at half time and after the match

At other times in their history Everton have also been known as The Black Watch The Blues and in the 1980s The School of Science

Like many Premier League football clubs Evertons players walk out onto the pitch to a particular song at the beginning of every match With Everton it is the theme tune to a 1960s television series called Z Cars Z Cars was about police working in a made up town which many people believed was based on real life Liverpool

Derby County Football Club is an English football club The club plays in the Football League Championship

The club was formed in 1884 by players from Derbyshire County Cricket Club who wanted something to do in the winter They started out by playing at the Racecourse Ground Derby

The Rams as Derby County are known were one of the first members of The Football League when it started in 1888 Back in 1895 the club moved to a new stadium The Baseball Ground It was called this because baseball had been played there much earlier beforehand and it became their home for the next 102 years When they moved Derby County had changed their club colours to the black and white they still use today at matches

In 1898 Derby got to their first FA Cup final but lost The same happened again in 1899 and 1903 Derbys went down to the Football Leagues Second Division for the first time in 1907 but they came back up to the First Division in 1911

In 1914 they were relegated again but won the Second Division the next year to get promoted World War I meant that they had to wait until 1919 to play First Division football again After just two seasons they were relegated yet again in 1921

After Derbys next promotion in 1926 the club got much better and were one of the top teams from the late 1920s all the way through to the 1939 1940 season which was interrupted when World War II broke out

The FA Cup restarted in the 1945 1946 season Derby got to the final again but this time they beat Charlton Athletic 4 1 to win the Cup Some people had thought the reason Derby kept losing in the FA Cup was that they were cursed by gypsies as the Baseball Ground was built on the site of a gypsy camp Some players even thought so and before the final they asked the gypsies to lift the curse

The Football League began again the next season but Derby did not play well and were relegated in 1953 Things went from bad to worse and in 1955 they were relegated to the Football League Third Division for the first time in their history Derby were too good for that league though and finished second at the first try Then they did even better next season by finishing first and going back up to the top division

In 1967 Brian Clough took over Derby County with Peter Taylor helping him Derby were back in Division Two but Clough got them promoted to the First Division in 1969 He led them to their first ever Championship in 1972 Derby could not win the title again the next season but they did get to the semi finals of the European Cup but they lost to Juventus A lot of people in England thought after the match that the Italian club had paid money to the referee as a bribe This was never proved Clough left the club after an argument with Derbys chairman Sam Longson Clough later became manager of Nottingham Forest FC where he went on to win a First Division championship and two European Cups

Derby won the league again in 1974 1975 this time with Dave Mackay as manager He used to play for the club as captain under Clough When Mackay left in 1976 Derby got slowly worse until they went down in 1980

Derbys stay in the Second Division was not a happy one and they were relegated to the Football League Third Division in 1984 It was exactly 100 years since the club formed and just nine years after their last Championship

The club made Arthur Cox manager After a two year stay in the Third Division they were promoted to the Second Division They won that league the next year going back up to the First Division in 1987

The club managed to finish 5th in 1989 but it was owned by businessman Robert Maxwell who was having money problems He stopped spending money on new players and sold the club not long before his death The club was relegated back to the Second Division in 1991

Jim Smith became Derbys manager in 1995 Before the end of the season Smith took the Rams  up to the Premier League for the first time

Derby County did well in the 1996 97 season finishing 12th in the final table with international players like Aljosa Asanovic and Igor Stimac playing well The club moved into the new 33000 seat Pride Park Stadium for the 1997 98 season and went on to finish ninth Next year they did even better finishing eighth but the season after that Derby struggled and finished 16th Another bad season followed in 2000 01 as Derby finished 17th in the Premiership  just one place clear of going down 

Jim Smith left the club in October 2001 and his assistant manager Colin Todd took over He kept his job for just 3 months before he was sacked At the end of January 2002 John Gregory got the managers job Derby started well but then lost seven of their last eight matches and were relegated again after six seasons in a row in the Premiership

It was a bad time to go down Money owed to the Football League teams by the TV company ITV Digital was never paid and Derby were one of the clubs to suffer worst They had to sell their best players and rebuild a team with mostly very young players They finished 18th after a difficult season In late March Gregory was suspended and George Burley came in as a temporary manager At the end of the season Gregory was sacked and Burley took over fully Owner Lionel Pickering lost control of the club and a new board of John Sleightholme Jeremy Keith and Steve Harding came in Derby finished 20th in the 2003 2004 First Division campaign but did much better in the 2004 05 season and finished 4th in the Division which was now called the Football League Championship This meant they won a promotion play off spot but lost in the semi finals to Preston North End Soon after losing Burley left Derby then employed Phil Brown for a short period who was then replaced by the Academy Coach Terry Westley who kept the club up in the 2005 06 season

Before the final game of the 2005 06 season a local consortium led by Peter Gadsby took over the Rams and gave the managers job to Billy Davies who left Preston after compensation was agreed by both clubs for his services The new changes and fresh activity in the transfer market promise a bright future for this founder member of the football league

Following a poor start to the 2007 2008 season which saw Derby achieve just one win in 14 matches Billy Davies has left Derby County FC

Many people think the best Rams player ever was Steve Bloomer one of the highest scoring players in the history of English football He played for Derby from the late 19th century to just before the First World War Other top players include the FA Cup winners Peter Doherty Jackie Stamps and Raich Carter In more recent years players like Roy McFarland Archie Gemmill Colin Todd Kevin Hector Steve Powell Ron Webster Alan Hinton and Dave Mackay played in the championship winning sides More recently the England goalkeeper Peter Shilton Stefano Eranio and Igor Stimac all played for the Rams Bobby Davison was also a favourite of Rams fans Recent famous players also include locally born Matthew Debyshire who has achieved some degree or recognition at Blackburn Rovers but has expressed desire to play a more successful clubs like Tottenham Hotspurs

Wimbledon Football Club was an English football club The club began in Wimbledon in 1889 In 2002 it moved to Milton Keynes and it 2004 it changed its name to Milton Keynes Dons FC Many football fans in Wimbledon did not agree with the move They decided to start a new club there which is called AFC Wimbledon

The club played in the English Football League and won the FA Cup in 1988 It was a professional football club which means that the players get paid to play

Also in 1992 the club decided that its ground at Plough Lane was too small and moved away from Wimbledon to Selhurst Park in Croydon This ground is owned by Crystal Palace FC They stayed there for the next 12 years 

In 2002 the clubs owners decided that they wanted to move the club out of London Nobody really knows why they wanted to move They said that there were too many clubs in London that not enough people were coming to watch the matches This meant that they did not collect enough money at the gate to pay everyone and that is why they could not afford to stay They looked at Cardiff and Dublin before deciding to move to Milton Keynes Milton Keynes is a new city that is 45 miles north of London When they said what they wanted to do most of their fans stopped paying to see matches which meant that they had even less money to pay everyone

Before the move could happen they had to get permission from the Football Association The FA is the association of all the football clubs in England The clubs elect a Committee to decide what to do about things Most things they have to decide are easy but this was not easy to decide Or maybe they knew what to decide but did not want to be the ones to decide it So they asked three clever men to study the problem and tell them what would be best to do These three men said that the club should be allowed to move 

Some members of the Committee did not like this decision and tried to stop it But the owners of Wimbledon FC said that they would get a judge to decide if anyone tried to stop them It costs a lot of money to go to court and whoever loses has to pay for everybody The other clubs would not agree to pay if this happened so the FA had to disagree the move

But it was already too late for the owners of Wimbledon FC They had no money left They had borrowed money from the bank to keep going but now the bank wanted its money back When you cannot pay back what you borrow this is called going bankrupt and that is what happened Luckily the group in Milton Keynes that first wanted them to come still wanted them So this group paid back some of the money and in 2002 the club moved to Milton Keynes They began playing in the National Hockey Stadium beside Milton Keynes Central railway station and stayed there for two years until their new stadium was ready 

Many football fans around England did not like the idea that a club could move They believe that a club belongs to a town and it is not like a furniture shop that closes down in one town and opens in another town Another reason that they did not like it is that they would love to see their own club get into the Football League The only way that they can do that is if they win their regional league then win the Football Conference So they felt that Milton Keynes was jumping the queue to get into the League Because of this many fans refused to attend any games they played

In 2004 the new owners changed the name to Milton Keynes Dons FC which combined the name of their new home with the nickname from Wimbledon With this Wimbledon FC ceased to exist

But the boycott continued In 2006 the Football Fans Federation proposed a way forward The most important thing for the town of Wimbledon was the trophies that the club had won when it was called Wimbledon FC The agreement was that Milton Keynes Dons FC would give these trophies to Merton Borough Council which is the local government area that contains Wimbledon The league history of Milton Keynes Dons FC would start from 2004 which is when they changed their name The Fans Federation would ask fans to end the boycott Everybody agreed and this is what has happened

The asteroid belt or main belt is a ring of small and large rocks and dust between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter The biggest object in the asteroid belt is Ceres a dwarf planet Most asteroids orbit at 2 to 3 times the distance between Earth and the Sun Planets that are inside  or before  the asteroid belt are called inner planets Planets that are outside  that is after  the asteroid belt are called outer planets so Mercury Venus Earth and Mars are inner planets while Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune are the outer planets

The asteroid belt looks a lot like the orbit of a planet There may be a reason for this There is some evidence that there used to be a planet that orbited the sun between Mars and JupiterfactdateJuly 2010 It might have exploded and the asteroids in the asteroid belt may be the remains of that planet

The idea that there was once a planet between Mars and Jupiter that exploded to become the asteroid belt is called the Exploded Planet Hypothesis The Exploded Planet Hypothesis has several reasons to support it Firstly if a broken wikt linkterrainterrestrial planet exploded pieces that flew into space would look like rocks and icefactdateJuly 2010 Our planet is made of mostly water so if it exploded it would send millions of tons of water into space and this water would become ice maybe making really big comets

More reasons that might support this hypothesis are the crater scars on many planets and moons When a very large meteorite hits a planet or a moon it leaves a crater However some scientists argue that the meteroites hit the planets and moons randomly over many many years and some say that the Exploded Planet Hypothesis could not be true because there are not enough asteroids in the asteroid belt to make up a whole planet Those who think the Exploded Planet Hypothesis is true however say that if all the comets and other objects in the solar system that look like they come from a planet were counted this exploded planet would be much bigger than the earth

The asteroid belt failed to form a planet because of Jupiters gravity The belt used to contain many more asteroids than it does today but Jupiters gravity disturbed the orbiting debris and much of it was sent into orbits which meant it was lost to the asteroid belt The total mass of the material in the asteroid belt today is thought to be about 4 of the mass of the Earths Moon

Gardening is the growing of plants such as flowers shrubs and trees as a hobby or recreation Some people also grow vegetables or fruit in their gardens People do gardening outdoors in the soil in their backyard or in pots or containers on their balcony or on their patio Some people do gardening on a roof

People do indoor gardening inside their house or inside a building Sometimes indoor gardening is done in greenhouses which are special buildings where plants are grown A greenhouse has a transparent glass or plastic roof and walls that let sunlight in Water gardening is growing plants in ornamental pools and ponds People doing water gardening plant water lilies and other aquatic plants 

Gardening can be done outside of the home in city parks botanical gardens zoos amusement parks theme parks and around tourist attractions These types of gardens are cared for by people called gardeners or groundskeepers

Gardening is related to farming But farming is done on a much larger scale A farm may have hundreds of square kilometers of plants and crops A garden in a persons backyard is usually only measures a few square meters As well farming is done as a business to sell the crops fruit and vegetables that are produced Gardening is done just to produce fruit or vegetables for the gardeners own family Gardening is done as a hobby or as a recreation not as a business

Gardeners use tools to dig in the soil and water the crops These tools include a spade a hoe a basket a watering can a hose a bucket and a wheelbarrow

In many countries and cultures designing beautiful gardens is considered to be an art In Japan for instance Zen monks build decorative gardens In Europe in the 1700s kings and queens had formal gardens built

A democracy is a kind of government A democracy is a system where people are able to decide how their country or community should be run

The most common type of democracy is representative democracy where people elect their leaders who decide the laws Elections are usually held every few years When they happen whoever gets the most votes will end up with the most power until the next election

An important part of representative democracy is political parties Politicians will belong to a political party an organisation of politicians with similar ideas on what to do Therefore in elections people will not just vote for a single person but for political parties

There are two kinds of democracy Direct and indirect 

In direct democracies everyone has the right to make laws together One modern example of direct democracy is a referendum which is the name for the kind of way to pass a law where everyone in the community votes on it Direct democracies are not usually used to run countries because it is hard to get millions of people to get together all the time to make laws and other decisions There is not enough time

In an indirect or representative democracy people choose representatives to make laws for them These people can be mayors councilmen members of Parliament or other government officials This is a much more common kind of democracy Large communities like cities and countries use this method but it may not be needed for a small group

This kind of government was developed long ago by the ancient Greeks in the city of Athens They had everyone who was a citizen got together in one area The Assembly would talk about what kinds of laws they wanted and voted on them The Council would suggest the laws In the Assembly the participants are only the citizens In the Council they would pick them by draws The participants in the Council would change every year and the amount of people in the Council is at the most 500 The Greek citizens would pick a leader by writing the name of their favorite candidate on a piece of stone or wood The person with the most votes became the leader

In the Middle Ages there were many systems in which there were elections or assemblies although only a few people could join in at this time The Parliament of England began from the Magna Carta a document which showed that the Kings power was limited and protected certain rights of the people The first elected parliament was De Montforts Parliament in England in 1625

However only a few people could actually join in Parliament was chosen by only a few percent of the people The ruler also had the power to call parliaments After a long time the power of Parliament began to grow After the Glorious Revolution in 1688 the English Bill of Rights made Parliament more powerful Later the ruler became a symbol instead of having real power

A game is something that people do for fun It is different from work In many games people play against other people 

There are different kinds of games For example in video games people often use controllers to control what happens on a screen such as a television screen In board games players often move pieces on a flat surface called a board Some examples of board games include Monopoly chess and checkers In card games players use playing cards

Ludwig Wittgenstein was probably the first academic philosopher to address the definition of the word game In his Philosophical Investigations Wittgenstein demonstrated that the elements of games such as play rules and competition all fail to correctly define what games are He concluded that people apply the term game to a range of different human activities that are only related a little bit

French sociologist Roger Caillois in his book Les jeux et les hommes said that a game is an activity that must have the following traits

Computer game designer Chris Crawford attempted to define the term game using a series of dichotomies

Crawfords definition may thus be rendered as an interactive goal oriented activity active agents to play against in which players can interfere with each other

Nebraska is a state in the center of the United States Its capital is Lincoln The largest city in Nebraska is Omaha

Nebraska is known for its agriculture especially beef and corn

Nebraska has hot summers and cold winters A temperature of 30 C is common in the summer and in the winter it can be 20 C or colder at night

On May 30 1854 the United States government made a law called the Kansas Nebraska Act It made two territories called Kansas Territory and Nebraska Territory In the 1860s many people moved there to take free land from the government Nebraska became a state on March 1 1867

We use time to sequence events to compare their durations and the intervals between them and to quantify the speed at which objects move and things change

To measure time we can use anything that repeats itself regularly One example is the dawn of a new day Two more are the phases of the moon and the seasons of the year Even in ancient times people developed calendars to keep track of the number of days in a year They also developed sundials that used the moving shadows cast by the sun through the day to measure times smaller than a day Today highly accurate clocks can measure times less than a billionth of a second The study of time measurement is horology

The SI unit of time is one second written as s

In Einsteinian physics time and space can be combined into a single concept See space time continuum

A force is always a push pull or a twist and it affects objects by pushing them up pulling them down pushing them to a side or by changing their motion or shape in some other way

Laboratory techniques are the techniques of handling the various pieces of apparatus

Ways to dissolve a solid in a liquid or to mix two liquids in a test tube

Heating techniques Collecting gases 

The International System of Units is the international standard form of the metric system today SI is the short name for this from the French language phrase Systme International dunits

The metric system is a system of measuring based on the metre for length distance or displacement kilogram for mass and second for time

Lake Michigan is one of the five Great Lakes in North America 

It has a surface area of 22300 square miles It is 307 miles long by 118 miles wide Lake Michigan is the 5th largest lake in the world

It is bounded by the US states of Indiana Illinois Wisconsin and Michigan The largest city on Lake Michigan is Chicago It is the only Great Lake that does not touch Canada

A gas syringe is a tool used in a laboratory It is used to collect a gas or to measure the volume of a gas

Simple systems can be settled in the laboratory to collect gas or to compress it It is usually used to explain Gas Law

In chemistry a mixture is a substance that is made up of two or more simpler substances These substances can be chemical elements or compounds A mixture can be a liquid a solid or a gas

A mixture is not the same as a compound which is made of two or more atoms connected together For instance a mixture of the gases hydrogen and nitrogen contains hydrogen and nitrogen not the compound ammonia which is made of hydrogen and nitrogen atoms

When the things mixed together are all the same phase like two solids it is called a homogeneous mixture If different phases are mixed together like sand and water it is called a heterogeneous mixture

If one substance in a mixture dissolves in the other it is called a solution For example if sugar is put in water it forms a mixture then dissolves to make a solution If it did not dissolve it would be called a suspension

Solids can be mixtures also Many kinds of soil and rock are mixtures of different minerals

Language families are groups of languages that are related to each other because they come from a common older language The languages in such a family are similar in their vocabulary or structure

For example French and Spanish both come from Latin Latin was spoken a long time ago and some of the people who spoke it started to speak one way saying for example for good bueno while another group started saying bon Most words are said a little differently in Spanish and French so the two are called different languages

Most languages belong to a language family but some languages do not These languages are called Language isolates

There also are Constructed languages like for example Esperanto Constructed languages are made for different reasons making a world language for fun for use in fiction etc

Some language families with sub families and language examples

Chess is a board game for two players It is played on a square board made of 64 smaller squares with eight squares on each side Each player starts with sixteen pieces eight pawns two knights two bishops two rooks and one king and queen The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent Checkmate is a threat to the opposing king which no move can stop It ends the game

The game is played by the two opponents taking turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board One player has pieces of a light color the other player has pieces of a dark color There are rules about how pieces move and about taking the opponents pieces The player with white pieces always makes the first move Because of this White has a small advantage and wins more often than Black in tournament games 

Chess is popular and is often played in competitions called chess tournaments It is enjoyed in many countries and is a national hobby in Russia

Most historians agree that the game of chess was first played in northern India during the Gupta Empire in the 6th century AD This early type of chess was known as Chaturaga a Sanskrit word for the military The Gupta chess pieces were divided like their military into the infantry cavalry elephants and chariots In time these pieces became the pawn knight bishop and rook The English words chess and check both come from the Persian word shh meaning king 

The earliest written evidence of chess is found in three romances written in Sassanid Persia around 600AD The game was known as chatrang or shatranj When Persia was taken over by Muslims the game was spread to all parts of the Muslim world Muslim traders carried the game to Russia and to Western Europe By the year 1000 it had spread all over Europe In the 13th century a Spanish manuscript called Libro de los Juegos describes the games of shatranj backgammon and dice

The game changed greatly between about 1470 to 1495 The rules of the older game were changed in the West so that some of the pieces had more scope development of the pieces was faster and the game more exciting The new game formed the basis of modern international chess Historians of chess consider this as the most important change since the game was invented

The rules of chess are made by the World Chess Federation which is known by the initials FIDE meaning Fdration Internationale des checs The rules are written and explained in the section Laws of Chess FIDE also give rules and guidelines for chess tournaments 

Chess is played on a square board divided into eight rows of squares called ranks and eight columns called files with a dark square in each players lower left corner This is altogether 64 squares The colors of the squares are laid out in a checker pattern in light and dark squares To make speaking and writing about chess easy each square has a name Each rank has a number from 1 to 8 and each file a letter from a to h This means that every square on the board has its own label such as g1 or f5 The pieces are in white and black sets The players are referred to as White and Black and at the start of a game each player has 16 pieces The 16 pieces are made up of one king one queen two rooks two bishops two knights and eight pawns

Gold is a soft heavy dark yellowish shiny metal It has been used for many thousands of years by people all over the world for jewelry decoration and as money Gold was important because it was rare but also easier to use than other rare metals It is also used in tooth fillings and electronic equipment such as computers The color of this metal is also called gold

In chemistry gold is chemical element 79 a transition metal in Group 11 It has an atomic weight of 19996 amu Its symbol is Au from the Latin word for gold aurum

Gold is very soft A goldsmith can hammer it into thin metal sheets It is also ductile which means it can be pulled into wire When it is used in money or in jewelry it is often mixed with silver or some other metal to make it harder

Most metals are gray in color Gold is yellow because of the way its electrons behave cn The only other metal in common use that has a non gray color is copper

 Gold can mean that something or someone is very good or has done very well A gold medal is often the given to the first place winner in a race or other sport

Alluvial gold is gold that is found above the ground Edwar Hargraves was an Australian man who discovered gold in Australia This discovery started the Australian gold rush

A century is a way to describe a length of time One century is one hundred years The ancient Romans used the word century to describe a group of about one hundred soldiers organized into a single unit

The Roman numeral for 100 is C The word for 100 in Latin is centum

Centuries in the Gregorian Calendar begin at one instead of zero That means that in the year 2004 we were in the 21st century rather than 20th century

A centenary is a celebration of something that happened 100 years ago A bicentenary celebrates 200 years a tercentenary 300 years

A centenarian is someone who is 100 years old or more

Centennial means something that happens every 100 years or that lasts 100 years

The kilogram or kilogramme is a metric unit of mass The official kilogram is the mass of one piece of platinum iridium metal kept in Paris The piece of metal is known as Prototype Kilogram It is now the only metric unit which is defined as an object 

There are attempts to define the kilogram in other ways One example specifies a number of atoms of a certain substance 

One kilogram is a little more than 22 pounds One tonne is one thousand kilograms One litre of water weighs almost exactly one kilogram at 398 centigrade at sea level This was the basis of the definition of the gram in 1795

In 1879 the piece of metal was made It was officially chosen to be the kilogram in 1889 It was made of 90 platinum and 10 iridium Those metals were chosen because they do not rust or corrode like most metals It is stored in a vault at the BIPM in Svres France From 1795 to 1799 the unit of mass was not called kilogram but was called grave 

The original kilogram is kept inside bell jars Over time dust can collect on it Before it is measured it is cleaned to get the original size

The kilogram is a unit of mass In normal language measuring mass defines how heavy is something This is not scientifically correct Mass is an inertial property It measures the tendency of an object to stay at a given speed when no force acts on it 

Sir Isaac Newtons laws of motion contain an important formula F ma F is force m is mass a is acceleration An object with a mass of one kilogram will accelerate at one meter per second per second when acted upon by a force of one newton This about one tenth the acceleration due to earths gravity 

The weight of matter depends on the strength of gravity The mass of matter does not The mass of an object is the same everywhere Objects are weightless for astronauts in microgravity However the objects still have their mass and inertia Astronaut must use ten times as much force to accelerate a ten kilogram object at the same rate as a one kilogram object

A common swing as shown in the picture can show the relationship of force mass and acceleration Someone could push an adult on the swing The adult would accelerate slowly They would only swing a short distance forward before the swing would change direction If a child is sitting on the swing then the child would swing forward faster and further

There are various copies of the original Kilogram Some of these copies have gained or lost some mass This is a problem for scientists and engineers who need to make exact measurementsCitation neededdateJuly 2011

The second is a unit of time and one of the seven SI base units It is the time taken by 9192631770 cycles of radiation that comes from electrons moving between two energy levels of the caesium 133 atom

The second sometimes abbreviated sec is the name of a unit of time and is the International System of Units base unit of time

Other units of time are defined in terms of the second There are 86400 seconds in one day 3600 seconds in one hour and 60 seconds in one minute

SI prefixes are frequently combined with the word second to denote subdivisions of the second eg the millisecond and nanosecond Though SI prefixes may also be used to form multiples of the second such units are rarely used in practice More commonly encountered non SI units of time such as the minute hour and day increase by multiples of 60 and 24

Under the International System of Units the second is currently defined as the duration of 9192631770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom This definition refers to a caesium atom at rest at a temperature of 0 K The ground state is defined at zero magnetic field The second thus defined is equivalent to the ephemeris second

The international standard symbol for a second is s

1 international second is equal to

There are 31536000 seconds in a common year 31622400 seconds in a leap year and 31557600 seconds in a Julian year

Originally the second was known as a second minute meaning the second minute division of an hour The first division was known as a prime minute and is equivalent to the minute we know today

The factor of 60 comes from the Babylonians who used factors of 60 in their counting system However the Babylonians did not subdivide their time units sexagesimally The hour had been defined by the ancient Egyptians as either 112 of daytime or 112 of nighttime hence both varied with the seasons Hellenistic astronomers including Hipparchus and Ptolemy defined the hour as 124 of a mean solar day Sexagesimally subdividing this mean solar hour made the second 186 400 of a mean solar dayfactdateApril 2007its rather unlikely the ancients defined the second this way  which placing it here suggests Hellenistic time periods like the mean synodic month were usually specified quite precisely because they were calculated from carefully selected eclipses separated by hundreds of yearsindividual mean synodic months and similar time periods cannot be measured Nevertheless with the development of pendulum clocks keeping mean time the second became measurable The seconds pendulum was proposed as a unit of length as early as 1660 by the Royal Society of London The duration of a beat or half period of a pendulum one metre in length on the Earths surface is approximately one second

In 1956 the second was defined in terms of the period of revolution of the Earth around the Sun for a particular epoch because by then it had become recognized that the Earths rotation on its own axis was not sufficiently uniform as a standard of time The Earths motion was described in Newcombs Tables of the Sun which provides a formula for the motion of the Sun at the epoch 1900 based on astronomical observations made between 1750 and 1892 The second thus defined is

This definition was ratified by the Eleventh General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960 The tropical year in the definition was not measured but calculated from a formula describing a tropical year which decreased linearly over time hence the curious reference to a specific instantaneous tropical year Because this second was the independent variable of time used in ephemerides of the Sun and Moon during most of the twentieth century it was called the ephemeris second

With the development of the atomic clock it was decided to use atomic clocks as the basis of the definition of the second rather than the revolution of the Earth around the Sun 

Following several years of work Louis Essen from the National Physical Laboratory and William Markowitz from the United States Naval Observatory determined the relationship between the hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium atom and the ephemeris second Using a common view measurement method based on the received signals from radio station WWV they determined the orbital motion of the Moon about the Earth from which the apparent motion of the Sun could be inferred in terms of time as measured by an atomic clock As a result in 1967 the Thirteenth General Conference on Weights and Measures defined the second of atomic time in the International System of Units as

The ground state is defined at zero magnetic field The second thus defined is equivalent to the ephemeris second

The definition of the second was later refined at the 1997 meeting of the BIPM to include the statement

The revised definition would seem to imply that the ideal atomic clock would contain a single caesium atom at rest emitting a single frequency In practice however the definition means that high precision realizations of the second should compensate for the effects of the ambient temperature within which atomic clocks operate and extrapolate accordingly to the value of the second as defined above

Sometimes in RPGs a second is used to refer to a small period of time or a single turn of combat It is used as a standard moment of time and does not necessarily refer to a real second and could be shorter or longer depending on the scenario

Orange is a color It is the combination of red and yellow

Orange is the color of an orange fruit which is where the name of the color comes from Before the orange fruit was introduced to England in the 1500s this color was called red yellow The first recorded use of orange as a color name in English was in 1512 in the court of King Henry VIII

Orange is also one of the few words in the English language that does not rhyme with any other word Some say that it rhymes with door hinge although this is two wordsfactdateJanuary 2012

The Basque Country is a region in South West Europe that is contained within the borders of France and Spain

It is the home of the Basque people It is located at the western end of the Pyrenees on the Bay of Biscay Its boundaries are complicated The greater Basque Country consists of seven districts four within Spain and three within France 

No one knows when the Basques came to Europe Many say they have been there since the Neolithic period at the end of the Stone Age others say even before then 

The first information about the Basque Country is from Roman times According to evidence the Basque people already spoke their own language by then After the fall of Roman Empire the Basque Country was isolated from the invading Goths

During the Muslim invasion of South Europe the Basque Country split in two The Castillian and the Navarran lands A war with France split the Navarran zone in two 

After the Reconquista the Castillian Basque lands and Navarra became part of the new country Spain Since then Basque people from the Spanish area of the Basque Country have had their own government and fought to gain the northern part of the Basque Country from France

Today three of the Basque districts in Spain Araba Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa form a political unit known as an autonomous community of Spain This three district community is called the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country It is one of 17 autonomous communities in Spain

The fourth Basque district in Spain Navarra is its own separate autonomous Community of Spain

The three districts which form the North Basque Country are Lapurdi Nafarroa Beherea and ZuberoaXiberoa

The entire Basque region has a surface area of 20664 km2 7978 sq mi The Autonomous Community of the Euskadi covers 7234 km2 or 2793 sq mi The population of the Autonomous Community is about 2000000 about 5 of the total population of Spain The Basque language and Spanish are spoken there The most important city is Bilbao but the parliament is in Vitoria Gasteiz

M theory is a new idea in small particle physics that is part of superstring theory The idea or theory often causes arguments among scientists because there is no way to test it to see if it is true If ever proven true M theory and string theory would mean big progress for science

To understand M theory one must first have some knowledge of string theory For hundreds of years scientists have thought that the simplest objects in the universe are points like dots String theory says that this is wrong and that the simplest objects in the universe are shaped like pieces of string These strings are so small that even when looked at very closely they look like points Each basic particle is created by the strings vibrating in different patterns The reason scientists had not thought of this idea for so long is that strings are much harder to work with than points They seem to break such rules as causality and special relativity which says that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light

String theory has been developed because of a very important problem that has existed for almost 100 years Albert Einsteins theory that describes the universe on very large scales disagrees with two theories that describe things on very small scales There are also problems with the Standard Model it includes about 20 numbers that seem to have no explanation it has too many basic particles  some scientists think it needs to have fewer and it does not include gravity which is needed to explain weight

Many of these problems can be solved by thinking of basic particles as strings Now there is only one number with no explanation which gives the size of the strings String theory includes particles that cause gravity called gravitons finding this out delighted the scientists who work on string theory So string theory successfully brings General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics together

But there are some problems with string theory Normally we think of the universe as having 4 dimensions or basic directions 3 of these basic directions can be thought of as updown forwardbackward and leftright The other direction is time String theory needs 10 basic directions

These six other directions can be explained if they are curled up so they are much too small to see For example by following the path of a spiral it is possible to go a great distance along it without moving very far The 6 other directions can be thought of as tiny spirals  strings can move along them a great distance but not seem to move This can be looked at as a mathematical tricka trick that has little to do with the real world that can be seen and touched Such tricks are allowed if they give a theory that can better tell us how things work

Another problem with string theory is that there are 5 different versions of it Each version allows different kinds of strings and says they work in different ways String theory is supposed to be a theory of everything so there should be only one version not 5 M theory solves this problem

In 1995 Edward Witten started what has been called the Second Superstring Revolution by introducing M theory to the world This theory combines the 5 different string theories into one theory What Witten actually did was to predict that the fact that all these different theories were connected was a result of there being some underlying theory of which they were all approximations This theory is somewhat vague in nature and has not yet been pinned down

Additionally it was found that the equations that required string theory to exist in 10 dimensions were actually approximations as well The proposed M theory would need one extra dimension and instead be a theory that takes place in 11 dimensions Witten has himself compared this idea in simple terms to a general who takes up a position on a hilltop the extra space coordinate to get a better view of the battlefields two other dimensions

The combination is accomplished by knitting together a web of relationships between each of the string theories called dualities Each of these dualities provides a way of converting one of the string theories into another T duality is probably the most easily explained of the dualities It has to do with the size written as R of the curled up dimensions of the string theories It was discovered that by taking a Type IIA string theory that has a size R and changing the radius to 1R the result will end up being what is equivalent to a Type IIB theory of size R This duality along with the others creates connections between all 5 theories The fact that these dualities existed had been known before Witten came up with the idea of M theory 

Additional amusement has come for many in guessing what the M might stand for Regardless of what the M might possibly mean M theory has become one of the most interesting and active areas of research in theoretical physics today

Since Ibn al Haytham one of the key figures in developing scientific method the emphasis has been on seeking truth

Science and things that are not science are often distinguished by whether they use the scientific method One of the first people to create an outline of the steps in the scientific method was John Stuart Mill

There is no one scientific method but in general it is usually written as a number of steps

Not all scientists use the above scientific method in their day to day work Sometimes the actual work of science looks nothing like the above But on the whole it is thought to be a good method for finding out things about the world which are reliable and is the model for thinking about scientific knowledge usually used by scientists 

Lets say we are going to do an experiment to find out what things might change how sugar dissolves in a glass of water Below is one way to do this following the scientific method step by step

Does sugar dissolve faster in hot water or cold water Does the temperature affect how fast the sugar dissolves This is a question we might want to ask

One simple way to create an experiment would be to dissolve sugar in water of different temperatures and to keep track of how much time it takes for the sugar to dissolve

We will want to make sure that we use the exact same amount of water in each trial and the exact same amount of sugar If we did not have the same number of either we might influence the experiment in a way that would make it impossible to tell if the change in temperature was what was changing the speed of dissolving To be extra careful we would also run the experiment in a way that the water temperature does not change during the experiment

This is called isolating one variable which means making sure that only one thing is being changed each time

We will do the experiment in three trials which are exactly the same except for the temperature of the water

One way that makes it easy to see results is to make a table of them listing all of the things that changed each time we ran the experiment Ours might look like this

If every other part of the experiment was the same then this would be very good evidence that heat affects how fast sugar is dissolved 

We cannot know for sure though that there is not something else affecting it An example of a hidden cause might be that sugar dissolves faster each time more sugar is dissolved into the same pot This is probably not true but if it were it could make the results exactly the same three trials and the last one would be fastest We have no reason to think that this is true at this time but we might want to note it as another possible answer

A gas is one of the four most common states of matter In a gas the molecules move freely and are independent of each other This makes it different from a liquid where the molecules are loosely attached or from a solid where the bonds are strong and hold the molecules together Gases can be pure where each molecule is made of individual atoms elemental where each molecule is made of more than one of the same atom bound together or compounds where molecules are made of many types of atoms together An example of a pure gas is Neon an example of an elemental gas is Hydrogen and an example of a compound gas could be Carbon Dioxide 

A gas broken wikt linkmixturemixture contains a mix of any of the above types for example air which is 78 nitrogen 20 oxygen and 2 argon and carbon dioxide

All gases can flow like liquids This means the molecules move about independently of each other The majority of gases are colourless like Hydrogen Gas particles will spread about or diffuse in order to fill all the space in any container such as a bottle or a room Compared to liquids and solids gases have a very low density and viscosity We cannot directly observe most gases since they are without colour however it is possible to measure their density volume temperature and pressure

Pressure is the measure of how much pushing force something is putting on another object In a gas this is usually the gas pushing on the container of the object or if the gas is heavy something inside the gas Pressure is measure in Pascals Because of Newtons third law we can change the pressure of a gas by putting force on the object containing it For example squeezing a bottle with air inside pressurises to the air inside

Pressure when talking about gas is often related to the container A lot of gas in a small container would have a very high pressure A small amount of a gas in a big container would have a low pressure Gas can crate pressure itself when there is a lot of it The weight of all the gas above creates high pressure on any object underneath it including any more gas On a planet this is called atmospheric pressure

The temperature of a gas is how hot or cold it is In science it is usually measured in Kelvins although the everyday unit degrees is more common In a gas the average velocity of the molecules is related to the temperature The faster the gas molecules are moving the more they broken wikt linkcollisioncollide or smash into each other These collisions make energy which in a gas comes in the form of heat Conversely if the temperature around the gas becomes hotter then the gas particles will convert the thermal energy to kinetic energy making them move faster and making the gas hotter

A gas can go through two different state changes If the temperature is low enough the gas can condense and turn into a liquid Sometimes if the temperature is low enough it can go through deposition where it changes straight to a solid Normally a gas must first condense to a liquid and then freeze to become a solid but if the temperature is very low it can skip the liquid stage and instantly become solid Frost on the ground in winter is caused by this Water vapour goes into the air which is very cold and instantly becomes ice due to deposition

A family is a group of people who live together They share the housework and take care of one another

Three types of family are nuclear family single parent family and extended family

A nuclear family is made up of father mother and one or more children living together

A single parent family is one where either the mother or father is caring for the children in the family

Extended family means father mother children grandparents uncles aunts cousins nieces and nephews In the United States there are some circumstances where the extended family comes to live either with or in place of a member of the nuclear family But in most cases in the United States the extended family no longer lives in the same place but in many countries including China and India extended families traditionally live together

 A wave is a kind of change that moves from one place to another 

Waves are found everywhere in the natural world Examples of waves

Waves have properties that can be measured All waves can be pictured by adding sine waves Here is a picture of a sine wave

Sine waves can be measured too The shape of a sine wave is given by its amplitude phase wavelength and frequency The speed that the sine wave moves can be measured The amplitude and wavelength of the sine wave is shown in the picture

The highest point on a wave is called the peak The lowest point is called the trough The peak of a wave and the trough of a wave are always twice the waves amplitude apart from each other The part of the wave half way in between the peak and the trough is called the baseline

All waves are made by adding up sine waves Waves also have amplitudes phases wavelengths frequencies and speeds that can be measured

Some waves can move through matter while others cannot For instance some waves can move through empty space light waves for example Sound waves on the other hand cannot move through empty space Inherently all waves carry energy from one place to another when they move In some applications of technology waves may carry meaningful information from one place to another such as news on the radio 

Usually after a wave moves through matter the matter is the same as it was before the wave was introduced though in some cases matter can be affected by waves traveling through it In 1922 Louis de Broglie found out that all waves are also particles and all particles are also waves

In matter

   

   

   

The blue waves move off to the right They are traveling waves The red waves do not move They are standing waves   

Solitary waves are hard to explain They were first observed in a river channel in 1834 Something gets a bulge of water starting moving up the channel and the bulge on the surface of the water continues to move up the stream At first physicists did not believe the story they heard from the man who observed it    Light waves can move through space Light is different from wind or water because light sometimes acts like waves and sometimes it acts as little bits called particles The nature of light is a big part of quantum mechanics

A weapon is an object that can be used to attack or injure a person or animal People have used weapons since very ancient times Some of the oldest remains that we have of ancient people are weapons made of stone Ancient people also used spears and bows and arrows 

After people learned to make things of metal many people used swords People also built huge machines which could throw rocks to destroy the walls of enemy cities Some of these machines were called catapults or siege engines

Later gunpowder was invented in China and the Europeans began using it to make guns and cannons These weapons were much better than the older weapons and helped the Europeans to conquer people in many parts of the world People in many parts of the world used guns such as rifles and shotguns for hunting animals and handguns for shooting other people

People continued to invent new weapons In the 1800s the machine gun was invented which could shoot many bullets very fast When airplanes were invented people began to use them to shoot enemies and to drop bombs on them They built tanks which had big guns and strong armor They began to use land mines a bomb which soldiers hide in the ground and which explodes when someone walks on it Poison gas was used in World War I 

In World War II Germany began to use missiles to carry bombs to England At the end of World War II the United States used atomic bombs to destroy the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki 

After World War II people continued to develop new weapons Now many people are concerned about weapons of mass destruction weapons that can kill many people very fast and are usually cheap and easy to make and use 

One kind of weapon of mass destruction is poison gas New kinds of poison gas such as nerve gas are much more powerful than the old kinds Another kind of weapon of mass destruction is disease germs which could be used to make many people sick and maybe kill them There are also many land mines which have been buried in the ground in many countries and which kill and injure many people every year 

Old weapons still kill many people in wars and fighting In wars in Africa in the 1990s and early 21st century many people were killed with machetes 

People sometimes try to make laws treaties and international agreements to try to control weapons because they are worried about all the killing done with them 

Laws vary from country to country for example in the United States the right to keep and bear arms is guaranteed to all citizens by the Constitution A country may say that people in that country cannot keep or use guns or that people can only keep guns when the government says it is okay Countries may agree with each other that they should not use certain weapons against each other or should not have a lot of missiles

Things specifically made as weapons that most ordinary people can carry include

Weapons that soldiers or police personnel carry include

Weapons that the defense people of a national government have include

Other types of weapons include

A Christmas cake is a heavy cake containing much dried fruit and usually having a covering of icing It is made to be eaten at Christmas It can also be called a fruitcake

The City of London is a district of London capital city of England and the United Kingdom It is in central London and is the oldest part of the city dating back to Roman times

The City of London has its own mayor the Lord Mayor of London and other ancient features of government dating back to medieval times

It is here in the City of London where most of the United Kingdoms financial trade is done It is a very small area covering only a square mile and has a very small population too However many people come to work here and during the day it can be very busy with some 300000 people in it

The City has its own police force the City of London Police

The City vies with New York City as the financial capital of the world many banking and insurance institutions have their headquarters there The London Stock Exchange Lloyds of London and the Bank of England are all based in the City 

Over 500 banks have offices in the City and the City is an established leader in trading in Eurobonds foreign exchange energy futures and global insurance The Alternative Investment Market a market for trades in equities of smaller firms is a recent development In 2008 the City of London accounted for 4 of UK GDP

London is the worlds greatest foreign exchange market with much of the trade conducted in the City of London Of the 398 trillion daily global turnover as measured in 2007 trading in London accounted for around 136 trillion or 341 of the total The Pound Sterling the currency of the United Kingdom is globally the fourth most traded currency and the third most held reserve currency

Since 1991 Canary Wharf a few miles east of the City in Tower Hamlets has become a second centre for Londons financial services industry and houses many banks and other institutions formerly located in the Square Mile This development does not appear to have damaged the City growth has continued in both locations

The City is the site of Roman Londinium and the archaeological remains are on display in the Museum of London City Wall

Bankside is the old part of the London Borough of Southwark It is next to the River Thames

The River Thames is a large river in England It goes through London the capital city of the United Kingdom

The Thames is 346 kilometres long and its source is near the village of Kemble in the Cotswolds it flows through Oxford Reading Maidenhead Eton and then Windsor From the outskirts of Greater London it passes Syon House Hampton Court and Richmond and Kew Then it passes through London then Greenwich and Dartford before it enters the sea in an estuary The Nore Part of the area west of London is sometimes called the Thames Valley and the area east of Tower Bridge development agencies and Ministers is called Thames Gateway

About 90 kilometres from the sea above London the river begins to show the tide caused by the North Sea It is said that London was made capital of Roman Britain at the spot where the tides reached in 43 AD but different things have pushed this spot farther up the river in the over 2000 years since then At London the water is slightly salty with sea salt

Like the Celts who lived in the area the Romans called the river Thamesis The Thames was an important way to go between London and Westminster in the 16th and 17th centuries The guild of watermen took Londoners back and forth by ferry One of them John Taylor the Water Poet described the river in a poem

In the 17th century and 18th century at a time some call the Little Ice Age the Thames often froze over in the winter This led to the first Frost Fair in 1607 with a tent city set up on the river with lots of odd amusements like ice bowling The last time the river froze over was in 1814 The building of a new London Bridge in 1825 may have helped stop it from freezing the new bridge had fewer pillars than the old allowing the river to flow more easily and stopping it from flowing slowly enough to freeze in cold winters

By the 18th century the Thames was one of the worlds busiest waterways as London became the centre of the very big British Empire During this time one of the worst river disasters in England took place on September 3 1878 on the Thames when the crowded pleasure boat Princess Alice crashed into the Bywell Castle killing over 640 people

In the Great Stink of 1858 pollution in the river became so bad that the House of Commons at Westminster had to quit sitting There was then a big attempt to hold the citys sewage by building huge sewers on the north and south river banks led by engineer Joseph Bazalgette

The coming of rail transport and road transport and the decline of the Empire in the years following 1914 have made the river less important than it was London itself is no longer used much as a port and the Port of London has moved down the river to Tilbury The Thames has been greatly cleaned up and life has returned to its dead waters

In the early 1980s the Thames Barrier was opened to control flooding It is used many times a year to stop water damage to Londons low lying areas up the river

There are many bridges and tunnels crossing the Thames including Tower Bridge London Bridge Lambeth Bridge and the Dartford Crossing

In September 2011 a British comedian David Walliams swam the entire 140 mile length of the river raising over 1million for a charity called Sport Relief

Many books have been written about the Thames Three Men in a Boat by Jerome K Jerome describes a boat trip up the Thames Somewhere near Oxford is where the Liddells were rowing in the poem at the start of Alices Adventures in Wonderland Somewhere near here was where Alice fell asleep in the book The river is named in both The Wind in the Willows and the play Toad of Toad Hall

In books set in London you will find Sherlock Holmes looking for a boat in A Study in Scarlet Bill Sykes kills Nancy just near the river in Charles Dickenss classic novel Oliver Twist

A queen is the female head of a royal family Sometimes she is the wife of a king but sometimes the queen is the ruler and her husband is not a king

In a country whose system of government is a monarchy the ruler or head of state is decided by inheritance That is when a ruler dies their child or nearest relative takes over For much of history most countries were governed in this way especially in Europe Some countries elect their monarch instead of using inheritance like the Holy Roman Empire and Malaysia

The wife of a king is also called a queen However the husband of a female ruler is not called a king The last King of Britain had a wife who was called Queen Elizabeth When he died he had no sons so he was followed by his daughter She was also called Elizabeth and became Queen Elizabeth II She is married to The Duke of Edinburgh but when she became Queen he did not become King

Many people do not think it is good to have a Queen because she is not elected though most people in the UK want to keep the royal family

A Queen Consort is the wife of a King She is not the head of state and does not have any powers unless they are given by the King or another law

A queen consort usually keeps the title of Queen after her husbands death for example

A Queen Regnant is Head of State and has all the powers of a sovereign 

A queen regnant does not keep the title of queen if she abdicates No Queen has ever abdicated in the United Kingdom but in the Netherlands

Male is one of the two sexes Most species have two sexes  male and female Human males are men or boys human females are women or girls The two sexes have different sexual organs They also often have different functions The female gives birth to children with the semen provided by the male In many human societies females often were involved in gathering while men used to hunt 

A Female is an organism that belongs to the sex that produces ova for sexual reproduction Females of some species also bear offspring

Organisms can either be grouped as male or female Female humans are called women and their bodies are different from male humans A woman has a vagina between her legs which is the main sexual organ They also have breasts with milk glands which allow them to nurse infants A womans shoulders are usually not as wide as a mans but women usually have wider hips than men because they need wide hips to be able to give birth

Christmas is a Christian holiday that celebrates the birth of Jesus Christians believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God Christmas means Feast day of Christ However it is not pronounced as Christ Mass it is pronounced Kriss muhss

The day known as Christmas Day is celebrated on the 25th of December Christmas is one of the holiest times of the year when it is believed by Christians that God sent Jesus to be born and to live among people and to save sinners from a life apart from God The other important Christian Holy Days are at Easter when the death and resurrection of Jesus are celebrated The season of preparing for Christmas is called Advent and begins on a Sunday about four weeks before Ramadan The Christmas Season ends on January 6 known as the Epiphany or the Twelfth Day of Christmas

Christmas is celebrated by Christian people all over the world and is also kept as a time of celebration by many people who are not Christian but enjoy the traditions The traditions are different from country to country but they nearly always include a feast giving gifts or cards and enjoying church or public festivities such as singing Christmas songs

Christmastime as it is often called is in the winter of the Northern Hemisphere at a time when there were already ancient festivals Some of the traditions that are used for Christmas are older than Christmas or come from other non Christian traditions such as Yule Other festivals at this time of year include Jewish Hanukkah

Modern traditions of Christmas often focus on the giving of gifts Stores use this time of year to sell a lot of goods and so start advertising for Holiday Season shopping for at least a month before Christmas often showing a Santa Claus

Christmas celebrates the birth of Jesus The story of how this happened is told in part of the Bible known as the Gospels There are four Gospels telling the life of Jesus The Gospel of Luke tells the most about his birth and the Gospel of Matthew tells another part of the story The Gospel of John says that Jesus came from God to bring his Word or message to all people

The Gospels say that many years before Jesus birth prophets had told a promise to the Jewish people that God would send them a Messiah or holy teacher Christians believe that the promised Messiah was Jesus His mother was a young woman called Mary who was engaged but not yet married to a carpenter called Joseph Joseph found out that Mary was pregnant and was upset He was wondering what he should do when an angel came from God to tell him that the baby was the Holy One The angel said that he must name the baby This was a sign that he would take care of it like his own child

At this time the Middle East was ruled by the Romans An order came that all the people had to travel back to their home town to put their names on the taxation lists Joseph took his new wife to Bethlehem There was nowhere for them to stay except a stable where the animals slept This is where the baby was born Joseph called him Jesus as the angel had said

The baby Jesus had two lots of visitors On the night he was born angels told some shepherds in the fields that they would find a newborn king lying in an animals feed bin Jesus other visitors were some wise men who saw a new star in the sky and followed it until they found the house where the family was now living and gave the young child expensive gifts of gold incense and a precious herb called myrrh

All these parts of the Christmas story are remembered and celebrated in different ways at Christmas in pictures songs plays stories and in models that are called cribs creches or presepe

Most Christian countries of the world use a calendar called the Gregorian Calendar but some churches use a calendar called the Julian Calendar Most Christians such as those of the Catholic and Protestant Churches celebrate the birth of Jesus on December 25

The Eastern Orthodox Church still uses the Julian Calendar They celebrate Christmas on December 25 in the Julian Calendar but because of the difference between the calendars it is the 7th of January in the modern Gregorian Calendar

Some Christians like Jehovahs Witnesses do not celebrate Christmas because there is no instruction from Jesus in the Bible which tells Christians to celebrate his birth Mormons celebrate Christmas on December 25 but they believe that Christs actual birth took place on April 6

Nowadays historians believe that Jesus was probably not born on December 25 or even at that time of year It is more likely that he was born in the Spring or the Autumn It is thought that the date of Christmas was chosen because there was already an important feast at that time the Zoroastrians and Romans used to celebrate a feast to the god Mithras on December 25 Historians believe this date was used by the Catholic Church to replace the pagan rites that took place at that time of the year

The Season of Advent which begins on a Sunday about four weeks before Christmas Day is celebrated by the Catholic and Anglican Churches as well as some others It is a time for people to prepare themselves for two different things for the coming of the baby Jesus and Christmas and for the second coming of Jesus when he shall rule over all the Earth in peace Not all Christian people remember Advent Some people use it as a time of fasting study meditation and prayer Special Advent Calendars are made for children with pictures or treats for each day of Advent

Generally Advent is a time when many people are very busy in preparation for Christmas Day cleaning and decorating buying food and presents writing cards and letters and cooking the Christmas feast

Before the 4th century AD Christians could only worship and celebrate in secret The feast of Christmas probably began while Constantine was the Emperor of Rome because it was he who made Christianity a legal religion and built some of Romes oldest churches Some old stone coffins or sarcophagi from this time are carved with pictures of Mary and baby Jesus and the Wise Men

Through the Middle Ages Christmas was celebrated with feasting singing and plays The plays were held in churches and also in castles and in market places where a big hay waggon was sometimes used as a stage

Because Advent was a time of prayer and preparation most parties were held after Christmas rather than before it The main pre Christmas celebration was the Feast of St Nicholas on December 6 In some countries particularly the Netherlands the tradition grew for children to receive presents on this day rather than Christmas Day The name of Saint Nicholas is now remembered in many countries as Santa Claus

Another traditional festivity that takes place during Advent is the Feast of St Lucy on December 13th which is particularly celebrated in Scandinavia where girls take part in candlelit processions and the daughters of the house must rise early to bring coffee or chocolate to the family

For many centuries the celebration of Christmas often began with a church service or mass which lasted from late at night to after midnight on Christmas morning Christmas Day was a time of feasting On the following day the Feast of St Stephen people from rich households would carry boxes of food out to the street for the poor and hungry Many people would go back to work but employers would give gifts of money to their workers The Holy Days continued with the feast of St John and Holy Innocents Day The feasting and parties ended on the Feast of the Epiphany the day of the Three Wise Men often called the Three Kings The season is nowadays remembered by the song The Twelve Days of Christmas William Shakespeare wrote a play to be performed as part of the celebration called Twelfth Night

Nowadays for many people Christmas has become a time when having parties sending messages to family and friends and giving presents has become more important than the celebration of Jesus birth Manufacturers and stores have responded to the feasting and present giving with lots of advertising decorations and displays This is known as Commercialism and many Christian people are annoyed by it In the US the Christmas displays are put up right after Thanksgiving late in November In some countries such as Australia department stores and shopping malls put up decorations at the beginning of November

Town councils celebrate by decorating streets and squares and providing Christmas entertainment for shoppers In countries of the Southern Hemisphere where Christmas falls in Summer there is a tradition of open air Carol Services often organised by the town council which are attended by thousands of people

Many Christians celebrate Christmas by attending church and with prayers and singing Many people are worried that the true meaning of Christmas has been lost because of the emphasis on giving and receiving presents However when most people even those who are not Christian talk about the true meaning of Christmas they are thinking of the words that the angels spoke to the shepherds Peace on Earth and Goodwill to all people

Christmas traditions are of several types There are traditions of the church traditions which are public celebrations and traditions that are kept by families These traditions are different in different times places cultures and even families

Traditions of the Church

The celebration of Christmas is a very important time for churches Almost every church has special services or celebrations Here are some of the ways that churches celebrate Christmas

It is the custom in many churches to set up a Crib scene of the Nativity or birth of Jesus The first scene of this type was set up by St Francis of Assisi in the 13th century They have been very popular in Italy ever since then and the custom has spread to other countries

Nativity scenes can be large with life sized statues or they can be tiny enough to fit in a matchbox They are made of many different things including carved and painted wood brightly coloured ceramics painted paper glued to boards and mixtures of material with clay wood cloth straw and metal used for different parts

The Advent wreath is a circle of leaves usually pine boughs ivy and holly with five candles in it which is hung up in a church The candles are lit on each Sunday in Advent and the central candle is lit on Christmas morning Churches are often decked with green branches and leaves and many churches also have a Christmas tree

Each year at Christmas there are a series of Bible readings from the Gospels that tell the story of the birth of Jesus These are combined with other readings that tell about the sinfulness of humans and how God promised to send the Messiah On Christmas morning the main Bible reading that is usually used in churches is not part of the story of Jesus birth It is the part of the Gospel of John that says that Jesus is the Word of God who was with God before the world began and who came to earth to teach all people to become the children of God

A popular tradition in many churches is the Carol Service which is often lit only by candles The carol service generally has lots of singing and Bible readings There is a tradition in England which began in the Temple Church in London and has now spread to many other places for a service of Nine Lessons and Carols The lessons are the Bible readings Some carols are sung by a choir and others by the choir and people Every year one of these services is recorded in a large English Church often Kings College Chapel in Cambridge and is broadcast on radio and television to be enjoyed by people who love good music and carol singing but particularly for people who cannot go to a Christmas service

Many cities and towns celebrate Christmas by putting up decorations These may be banners and bunting which are strung from buildings or lampposts They may be Christmas lights which can also decorate buildings and street trees Many large cities put up a huge Christmas tree in a public place such as those in Trafalgar Square in London Times Square in New York and Martin Place in Sydney This is often combined with an appeal to the people of the city to give money or gifts to help the poor and needy

In many cities the usual shopping hours are made longer before Christmas so that workers have more time to buy Christmas food and presents Shop windows are often decorated with Christmas scenes with large department stores often having animated scenes to entertain children Shopping malls and big stores often have a Santa Claus who sits on a throne while children tell him what they want for Christmas and have their photos taken

Many towns hold Christmas parades street entertainment and concerts Some towns have a tradition of carols with a choir and entertainers in the town hall while in Australia and New Zealand these concerts of Christmas entertainment and carols are usually held outdoors in parks or even on beaches with families bringing picnics The arrival of Santa Claus at the end of the evening is accompanied by a firework display

A traditional part of Christmas is the theatre entertainment This includes the performance of classical music such as Handels Messiah as well as orchestral concerts and band recitals Pantomimes are often played at Christmas and favourites include Peter Pan and Wendy and Cinderella Many childrens movies are released during the Christmas season

Because many people feel very lonely hungry and sad at Christmas many cities churches charities and service organisations try to help the poor and lonely by providing Christmas food and gifts for poor families and Christmas parties for people who are hungry or who are lonely and without any friends or family

Family celebrations are often very different from each other depending on where a family comes from and the customs that have grown in particular families

Most families think of Christmas as a time to get together with other members of the family People often travel from far away to be with other family members at Christmas Those people who cannot travel often make long distance phone calls on Christmas Day Many people also see Christmas as a time to reach out to others that they know might be lonely and invite them to dinner on Christmas Day Christmas is seen as a time for people of all ages to have fun together for cousins to get to know each other for grandparents to see their grandchildren and for the family to admire the babies that have been born during the year Big family parties are usually a time of joy but some families often talk about their disagreements and have big fights at Christmas time

Family traditions are very different Some families might all go off to church together to a Carol Service a Midnight Mass or a Christmas Morning service Some families are pulled out of bed very early by children who want to open their presents In other families presents are given on St Nicholas Day on Christmas Eve or not until after church on Christmas morning The Christmas feast might start on Christmas Eve with a special breakfast on Christmas morning or at midday on Christmas Day

Some families have a tradition of carol singing and might go around the streets to hospitals and other such places singing with members of their church Other families like to watch certain television programs together which might include carol services and the Queens Message Some families use Christmas as a time to play music and sing together or to read a favourite book such as A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens In countries in the Southern Hemisphere a visit to the beach or a swim in a pool is often part of the Christmas Day tradition

Christmas Dinner usually eaten in the middle of the day is an important part of the family celebration The food differs from country to country and also from family to family In the Northern Hemisphere roasted meat and vegetables is generally the main course of the meal Often several types of meat are served which may include turkey ham roast beef or lamb There are often several courses with special treats that are usually only eaten at Christmas

In English speaking countries the traditional dessert is Christmas plum pudding Nowadays these are often bought from bakers but many people make their own to a family recipe The tradition came from the Middle Ages when the pudding was used to preserve some of the fruit from the Autumn until the mid winter A traditional pudding is baked six weeks before Christmas and is left tied up in a cloth in a cool place Stirring the pudding is sometimes a family tradition with everyone making a wish as they stir Traditionally a silver coin would be stirred into the pudding to bring luck to the person who found it Nowadays most coins cannot be used because they taste horrible and may be poisonous Some families use old coins or silver charms On Christmas Day the pudding must be boiled in a pot for several hours When it is served the cloth is cut off brandy is poured onto the pudding and is set on fire before it is carried to the table

Many families have a Christmas Cake or a special bread instead of a pudding These are very different depending on the country but often have Marzipan which is made from almonds and is traditional in many countries at Christmas In France Buche de Noel or gingerbread men and women are decorated and hung on the Christmas tree In Scotland a pastry biscuit called shortbread is made and has become a popular tradition in many countries A German tradition is pfeffernuss spiced cookies rolled in powdered sugar Other Christmas food includes raisins sultanas ginger Turkish delight almonds chocolates caramel toffee candy canes and oranges

Many families also prepare mulled wine which is warmed with cinnamon and nutmeg or egg nogs a sweet drink made of milk sugar eggs nutmeg and sometimes alcohol

In the Southern Hemisphere the traditional roast dinner is often replaced with cold cuts of meat and served with salads The first course might be prawn cocktail or a cold soup like borsch The plum pudding might be served with icecream White wine and beer are both served cold Christmas dinner may be served on the veranda or sometimes as a picnic

In most homes when Christmas is celebrated people set up a Christmas tree in the house This old Yuletide custom began in Germany as the Tannenbaum These are traditionally evergreens the best type being the Fir Tree which does not shed its needles or lose its fragrance The tree may be a cut tree that is bought from a plantation or taken from the forest Artificial trees are sometimes preferred to real trees particularly in Australia where there are no Fir Trees and the only types that can be bought are very messy and dry out fast in the hot weather The Christmas tree is decorated with lights shiny coloured balls sparkly tinsel and other ornaments A wreath of leaves or pine is often put on the front door of a house as a sign of welcome Other plants that have special significance at Christmas are holly which is used as decoration and mistletoe which is hung in the centre of a room The tradition is that people who meet under the mistletoe must kiss

Many people decorate their homes at Christmas time These decorations and the Christmas tree are generally inside but may be put where they can also be seen through a window by people passing by In the mid 20th century there grew up a custom for decorating the outside of houses as well These decorations may be just a few lights around the porch or hundreds of lights and colourful Christmas figures decorating the whole house and garden Some neighbourhoods hold competitions for the best decorated house and driving around the streets to look at them has become another family tradition

The giving of gifts at Christmas comes from several different ideas One is that God gave his son Jesus to the world at Christmas There is also the story of the Wise Men who came to the baby Jesus with three gifts gold frankincense and myrrh For many centuries it has been the custom for people to give small gifts at Christmas and also to give generously to the poor and needy to help them through the winter Another tradition has become linked to this one and the result is the tradition of Santa Claus or Father Christmas as he is sometimes called and who is nowadays thought by many children to be the bringer of presents

In the 4th century in a Greek village that is now part of Turkey there was a good man who would secretly given presents to the poor to help them He became a bishop and is called Saint Nicholas Over the centuries he became a very popular saint and lots of churches were named after him He was very popular in places where there were lots of sailors One of those places was the Netherlands In the Netherlands and many other European countries presents are given on the feast of Saint Nicholas December 6th Traditionally the presents are not big and are sometimes hidden or have a funny joke or poem that must be read In many towns of Europe a man dressed in bishops robes comes on a horse or in a boat acting as St Nicholas His name was often shortened to Sante Claus or Santa Claus in English

In English speaking countries where presents are usually given on Christmas Day not December 6th Santa Claus is usually thought of as coming on Christmas Night when his magic sleigh is pulled across the sky by reindeer and he comes into houses through the chimney While in Europe children put out their shoes for St Nicholas the English tradition is to hang up stockings in front of the fireplace Santa Claus would traditionally fill the socks or shoes with nuts raisins chocolates and an orange Nowadays children usually get much more expensive presents and hang up pillow cases or have the presents in a big pile under the Christmas tree

Another Christmas tradition is the sending of cards to friends and relatives These contain warm greetings and may also have a letter telling all the things that have happened to the person or family during the year

There are other holidays that take place around Christmas time

The Jewish people celebrate Hanukkah although this feast of lights is not their holiest time of the year Hanukkah is a remembrance of the miracle of Jewish survival against mighty empires A popular later legend suggested that one days worth of oil for the candelabra in the Temple in Jerusalem miraculously lasted for 8 days whilst new oil was prepared after the Jews had fought off their enemy and rededicated the Temple

Some African Americans celebrate Kwanzaa although many African Americans have a deeply rooted Christian faith so they may celebrate Christmas first and Kwanzaa as a cultural versus spiritual celebration

For Wiccans and Neopagans Yule celebrates the rebirth of the earth during the winter solstice At Yule the Holly King God of winter is taken over by the Oak King God of Spring or rebirth also known as the Divine Child Common shared traditions between Yule and Christmas include caroling decorating the Yule tree kissing under the mistletoe and honoring Kriss Kringle the Germanic God of Yule Some secular or non religious groups also celebrate Yule on the Winter Solstice as the middle of winter and for its cultural importance

An adjective is a name for a word that modifies a noun Nouns are words that name a place a person a thing or an idea An adjective is a word that gives more information about the noun that goes with it 

Word Order

As a rule in English the adjective comes before the noun it describes

Some examples with the adjective in bold

Exception

Sometimes an adjective is not followed by a noun

Its still an adjective because we could have the blue sky the funny joke and the crazy man The adjective is still describing the noun though they are not side by side

An adjective is a name for a word that modifies a noun Nouns are words that name a place a person or a thing An adjective is a word that gives instant status about the noun to enable to make a clear picture of the noun in the mind of the reader and create a feeling of the writer

Sometimes there are different forms of the same adjective If one joke makes a person laugh laugh more than another joke then that joke is funnier This is called the comparative form of the adjective The day that is colder than any other is the coldest day This is the superlative form of cold Some adjectives need additional words when we want to compare them For instance one car may be cheaper than another but the second car may be more reliable Reliable is being trustworthy or worthy of trust deserving confidence 

The rule is

For short adjectives ending in a consonant like cold black fast one adds the suffix er to make a comparison of greater magnitude Example The North Pole is colder than Florida The greatest possible comparison is made by adding the suffix est Example The North Pole is the coldest place on the Earth For long adjectives like intelligent conscientious comprehensive one uses the word more to make a comparison of greater magnitude Example Children are more intelligent than adults To make the greatest possible comparison one uses the word most Example She is the most conscientious objector I have ever known

In the English language it is possible for a noun to modify another noun Example take the noun angel and the noun face Put them together and the result is angel face Make one up with country and house Now think of two nouns and put them together

One can make adverbs from some adjectives by adding the suffix ly Example take the adjective beautiful the adverb is beautifully One can do it the other way around take an adverb like presumably the adjective is presumable Presumable innocence means the accused is assumed to be innocent until proven guilty

The adjective guilty becomes the adverb guiltily and vice versa the adverb guiltily becomes the adjective guilty As a rule dogs chase cats but not vice versa Cats seldom chase dogs

Modern paper is a thin sheet of wood fibers pressed together People write on paper and books are made of paper Paper can absorb liquids such as water so people can clean things with paper

Paper is normally made from wood pulp Wood is ground up and mixed with water and other chemicals to make a thin liquid called paper pulp Paper pulp can be bleached to make blank paper and dyes can be added to make colored paper This pulp is pressed into sheets of paper When the sheets are dry they are cut into pieces of paper

Sometimes paper is made glossy by adding clay or other materials Sometimes paper is made from other kinds of paper This is an example of recycling

Not all paper is made from wood Other kinds of fiber can be used also People make paper from cotton linen and hemp

Writing started long before the invention of paper People wrote on many kinds of material They wrote on cloth on stone walls on wood In Mesopotamia the Sumerians wrote on clay tablets many of which have survived today 

Many centuries ago as early as the third millenium BC people in Egypt made a kind of paper from the papyrus plant This is where the word paper comes from The people of Greece and Rome learned to do this too The Romans wrote on parchment on waxed tablets and on wood

In China 105 AD the eunuch Tsai Lun told his Emperor he had made paper They had previously used bamboo and silk The material used in this ancient paper included cotton rags hemp various plant fibres and old fish nets The oldest existing paper with writing on it was found in the ruins of a watchtower in the Great Wall of China It dates to about 150 ADp5 Even earlier paper has been claimed The oldest surviving piece of paper in the world is made of hemp fibers discovered in 1957 in a tomb near Xian China and dates from between the years 140 and 87 BCE Paper making was regarded by the Chinese as so valuable that they kept it secret as long as they could

People in Japan learned how to make paper with fibers of the mulberry tree around 610 AD This is called Japanese paper or Washi The Chinese invention spread to India and then to the Middle East and then to Italy 

An opportunity occurred after The Battle of Talas in 751 Then an Arab army captured soldiers of the Chinese There were some paper makers among the captured soldiers From them paper making spread throughout the Islamic world In 757 a paper mill was built at Samarkand People learned to use linen as paper raw material and to use starch made from flour as an additive 

The Italians used hemp and linen rags In 1276 the first Italian paper mill was built at Fabriano and until the 14 century Italy was a paper supplier in Europe In 1282 the first watermark was introduced in Bologna

Paper was hard to make and it cost a lot of money In the 19th century new machines were made that could make paper out of wood fibres This was conceived in France 1798 but the machines were invented in England The first one was in use by 1812 It helped to make paper cheap enough for everyone to buy Around the same time other inventions were made like the pencil the fountain pen and a printing press that used steam power Because of these new things it was easy for people to write letters to buy books and newspapers and to keep records of what they did 

Today some of the largest paper producing countries are USA Canada Finland Sweden and Russia Paper is produced in large factories called paper mills They produce hundreds of thousands of tons of paper each year

Paper is used for writing and printing Books magazines and newspapers are printed on paper

Paper is often used for money Paper used for money is often made in very special ways to make it hard for people to print their own money A piece of paper money is called a banknote a bill or a note

Paper can be used for cleaning Special forms of paper are used such as paper towels facial tissues or toilet paper

Pretty paper can be used as decoration It can be pasted onto the walls of a room this is called wallpaper Paper can be used to wrap gifts This is called wrapping paper or gift wrap

Some kinds of paper are strong and can be used in boxes and other packaging material Sometimes several layers of paper are held together with glue to make cardboard

Power has different meanings when talking about different subjects

There are four common states or phases of matter in the Universe solid liquid gas and plasma The state of matter affects a substances properties such as density viscosity malleability and conductivity

In a solid the positions of atoms are fixed relative to each other over long time That is due to the cohesion or friction between molecules This cohesion is provided by metallic covalent or ionic bonds Only solids can be pushed on by a force without changing shape which means that they can be resistant to deformation Solids also tend to be strong enough to hold their own shape in a container Solids are generally denser than liquids

In a liquid molecules are attracted to other molecules strong enough to keep molecules in contact but not strong enough to fix a particular structure The molecules can continually move with respect to each other This means that liquids can flow smoothly but not as smoothly as gases Liquids will tend to take the shape of a container that they are in Liquids are generally less dense than solids but denser than gases

In a gas the chemical bonds are not strong enough to hold atoms or molecules together and from this a gas is a collection of independent unbonded molecules which interact mainly by collision Gases tend to take the shape of their container and are less dense than both solids and liquids Gases have smaller forces of attraction than solids and liquids

Plasmas are gases that have so much energy that electrons of an atom cannot stay in orbit around one atomic nucleus The atomic ions and free electrons mix around like a hot soup 

Because the positive and negative charged particles are not stuck together plasma is a good conductor of electricity For example air is not good at conducting electricity However in a bolt of lightning the atoms in air get so much energy that they no longer can hold on to their electrons and become a plasma for a brief time Then an electric current is able to flow through the plasma making the lightning

Plasma is the most common state of matter in the universe Both stars and the interstellar medium are mostly made of plasma

Phases of matter can be changed by a number of things This includes pressure and temperature

When a solid becomes a liquid it is called melting When a solid becomes a gas it is called sublimation When a liquid becomes a gas it is called vaporization When a gas becomes a liquid it is called condensation When a liquid becomes a solid it is called freezing The freezing point and the melting point are said to be the same because any increase in temperature will cause it to melt and any drop in temperature will cause it to freeze This is also the reason that the vaporizing and condensation point are the same

Many other states of matter can exist under special conditions including strange matter superfluids and supersolids and possibly string net liquids Scientist work on new experiments at higher temperatures and energy levels than have ever been made They also work on experiments at very low temperatures Such experiments help scientists learn more about phases of matter

Quark gluon plasmas are a relatively newly discovered phase of matter that happen at about 2 trillion degrees Kelvin Basically scientists believe that protons and neutrons are held together by tiny things called quarks At an incredibly high temperature only achievable by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN quarks and gluons begin to separate into a new state of matter Little is known about quark gluon plasmas because of the huge amount of energy needed to make them

Bose Einstein condensates and fermionic condensates are phases of matter that apply to particles called bosons and fermions respectively Bose Einstein condensates and fermionic condensates occur at incredibly low temperatures Little is known about either state because of the sheer amount of energy needed to be taken away to create them Inside of them all of the particles begin to act like one big quantum state That is they have near zero electrical resistance and have almost no friction

In geometry perimeter is the distance around a flat object For example all four sides of a square rhombus have the same length so a rhombus with side length 2 inches would have a perimeter of 8 inches

Real life objects have perimeters as well A football field including the end zones is 360 feet long and 160 feet wide So the perimeter of the field is 3601603601601040 feet

The perimeter of a circle is usually called the circumference It may be calculated by multiplying the diameter times Pi Pi is a constant which is equal to 314159 however the places to the right of the decimal are endless The number of places used depend on the accuracy required for the result

A nation is an area of land ruled by a person or group of people No one else can make rules for that nation

The word nation comes from a word meaning birth or place of birth The adjective is national 

Some nations are people with a particular belief such as the Vatican City or ethnic group such as Armenia Others share an idea such as Democracy in the United States or Communism in China 

Some nations are controlled by a small minority who have all the power such as Saudi Arabia who hold the nation together with the use of this power

Some of these may also be combined The highest lawful authority of most nations is a constitution which is a document which states clearly what kinds of power the rulers have and how new laws must be made Many others are ruled by a single person who holds an office such as a King or Pope or from a long legal tradition without an official Constitution such as the United Kingdom 

Matrix can mean

A group of elements in the periodic table is called metals These elements usually have the following properties

Most metals are solid at room temperature but this does not have to be the case Mercury is liquid Alloys are mixtures where at least one part of the mixture is a metal Examples of metals are aluminium copper iron tin gold lead silver titanium uranium and zinc Well known alloys include bronze and steel 

The study of metals is called metallurgy

Most metals are hard shiny they feel heavy and they melt only when they are very hot Lumps of metal will make a bell like sound when they are hit with something heavy Heat and electricity can easily pass through a metal A lump of metal can be beaten into a thin sheet or can be pulled into thin wires Metal is hard to pull apart or smash If you push on a long thin piece of metal it will bend not break

Not all metals have these properties Lead for instance is very soft and heat and electricity do not pass through iron as well as they do through copper

Metals are very useful to people They are used to make tools because they can be strong and easy to shape Iron and steel have been used to make bridges buildings or ships 

Some metals are used to make items like coins because they are hard and will not wear away quickly For example copper aluminum gold and silver and nickel 

Some metals like steel can be made sharp and stay sharp so they can be used to make knives axes or razors

Rare metals with high value like gold silver and platinum are often used to make jewelery Metals are also used to make fasteners and screws Pots used for cooking can be made from copper aluminum steel or iron Lead is very heavy and dense and can be used as ballast in boats to stop them from turning over or to protect people from ionizing radiation

Alloys of metals  Many things that are made of metals may in fact be made of mixtures of at least one metal with either other metals or with non metals These mixtures are called alloys Some common alloys are 

People first began making things from metal over 9000 years ago when they discovered how to get copper from its ore They then learned how to make a harder alloy bronze by adding tin to the copper About 3000 years ago they discovered iron By adding small amounts of carbon to iron they found that they could make a particularly useful alloy steel

In chemistry metal is a word for a group of chemical elements that have certain properties It is easy for the atoms of a metal to lose an electron and become positive ions or cations In this way metals are not like the other two kinds of elements  the nonmetals and the metalloids 

On the periodic table we can draw a straight line from the element boron to the element polonium The elements that this line passes through are the metalloids The elements that are above and to the right of this line are the nonmetals The rest of the elements are the metals

Most of the properties of metals are because the atoms in the metal do not hold onto their electrons very tightly Each atom is separated from the others by a thin layer of valence electrons However some metals are different An example is the metal sodium It is soft melts at a low temperature and is so light it floats on water People should not try this though because another property of sodium is that it explodes when it touches water 

Most metals are chemically stable and do not react easily When metals do react they often react with oxygen The oxides of metals are basic The oxides of nonmetals are acidic However most of the elements on the periodic table are metals

Compounds which have metal atoms combined with other atoms to make molecules are probably the most common things on the Earth For example common salt is a compound of sodium

The use of metals is said to be the thing that makes people different from animals Before they used metals people made tools from stones wood and animal bones This is now called the Stone Age 

No one knows when the first metal was found and used It was probably what is called native copper which is sometimes found in large lumps on the ground People learned to make this into copper tools and other things although for a metal it is quite soft When it was melted over fire people learned how to make an alloy called bronze which is much harder and stronger than copper People made knives and weapons from bronze This time in human history after about 3300 BC is often called the Bronze Age that is the time of bronze tools and weapons 

Around the year 1200 BC some people learned to make iron tools and weapons These were even harder and stronger than bronze and this was an advantage in war The time of iron tools and weapons is now called the Iron Age Metals have been very important in human history and civilization Iron and steel were important in the making of machines Gold and silver were used as money in order to allow people to trade that is exchange goods and services over long distances

Many people thought that finding metals was a way to get rich There have been many times when gold was found and people moved quickly in large numbers to those places for example Central and South America after the year 1500 and many places after the year 1800 These are often called Gold Rushes

In astronomy a metal is any element other than hydrogen or helium This is because these two elements are the only ones that form outside stars In the sky a telescope can see the signs of metals and then the astronomer knows that there are stars

German can mean different things

It can mean the German language

It can mean a person from the country the Federal Republic of Germany or one of the earlier countries in the same area

When talking about a person it can mean someone who lives in Germany or someone who thinks of himself or herself as German

Indonesia is a country in Southeast Asia It is part of the Malay Archipelago It has 18108 islands 6000 of these islands are inhabited The most important islands of Indonesia are Java Bali Borneo Sulawesi and Sumatra The capital of Indonesia is Jakarta on Java The current president is Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono Modern Indonesia began on the 17th of August 1945 At 10 oclock on that Friday morning Ir Soekarno read Indonesias Declaration of Independence Indonesias Independence Day is a national holiday 

Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world with a population of 238452952 There are 111 inhabitants per km and the population of man and women is igual The official language of Indonesia is Bahasa Indonesia but a total of 737 languages are spoken throughout Indonesia mostly confined to remote tribal groups Other languages widely spoken in Indonesia include Javanese Balinese and Sundanese The closest countries are Papua New Guinea Malaysia and East Timor which share land borders with Indonesia Other neighbouring countries are Australia to the south Singapore to the Northwest and Philippines to the Northeast

The religion that most people in Indonesia follow is Islam although formally not an Islamic country Indonesia has the largest Muslim population on earth Other religions include Christianity Hinduism and Buddhism

Indonesia has written history as far back as the 7th century Before the colonial Dutch came in the 1700s Indonesia was made up of many kingdoms in constant warfare Indonesia was ruled by the Netherlands from the 17th century until World War II

During World War II the Japanese drove out the Dutch and took control of Indonesia After Japan surrendered in the war Indonesia claimed its independence on the 17th of August 1945 The proclamation was read by Ir Soekarno in Jakarta Soekarno later became Indonesias first President 

British troops came into Indonesia to restore peace and to rescue Europeans who had been prisoners of the Japanese The British troops also had the job of shipping home 300000 Japanese troops The Indonesian Republicans fought the British troops because it was expected that the British would give Indonesia back to the Dutch The Indonesian Republicans killed many of the Japanese prisoners before they could be sent home They also began killing people from minority groups who might be against the new Republic Many European and Indonesian European people were killed Many Chinese business people and other minority groups were killed or made homeless In Java there were many thousands of homeless people 

In 1946 the Dutch came back When the British left in 1947 there were 55000 Dutch soldiers in Indonesia The Dutch action was called Operatie Product or Politionele Acties The Indonesian Republicans fought the Dutch until 1949 But the Indonesian Republicans were badly organised and often fought among themselves As the Dutch forced the Republican soldiers out of different areas they moved in more troops until there was 100000 Dutch troops The Dutch refused to obey the United Nations who said they should stop the fighting in Indonesia The United States of America organised for meetings between Dutch and Indonesian leaders The Dutch finally agreed to recognise Indonesias independence in November 1949 

Because of the fighting and the bad organisation it took a long time for the country to become peaceful and for the economy to get better Many Indonesian soldiers had died between 45000 and 100000 Also a very large number of civilian Indonesians Europeans and Chinese had died perhaps as many as 200000

There are people of many different cultural groups living in Indonesia has more than 700 ethnic groups affected by Indians chineses arabes malaies and europeans

The word property can have several meanings

Property is something that belongs to someone If someone buys a car the car becomes their property The Statue of Liberty is the property of the people of the United States People who deal with buying or selling houses will often talk about properties meaning houses apartments offices etc

Properties can also mean the things that make something interesting the things that give it its characteristics For example Elasticity is a property of rubber in other words rubber is elastic This is close to the meaning for chemistry

In chemistry properties refer to the things that describe a material For example water is liquid under normal conditions boils at 100 degrees is colourless is odorless and so on All these descriptions are properties of water

In the theatre properties are things which are used in the performance of a play or opera Anything that is used but is not part of the scenery is a property eg furniture a tree a book that an actor pretends to read a pipe that they smoke The props are looked after by a properties master Sometimes for small things like books or fans it is the actor who is responsible for making sure he has the prop This is called a personal prop

Renegades is the 4th album by the music group Rage Against the Machine It was released in 2000

NEWI Cefn Druids Football Club are a Welsh football team

They play in the Welsh League

Aberystwyth Town Football Club are a Welsh football team

The club was started in 1884 They play at the Park Avenue stadium in Aberystwyth They play in the Welsh League They came third in the Welsh league in 1992 but have only had success at a regional level

The German language is a West Germanic language in the Indo European language family

It is spoken in Germany Austria Switzerland Liechtenstein and Luxembourg natively by around 100 million people It is the most widely spoken mother tongue in the European Union There are some people who speak German in Belgium and in the Netherlands as well as in France and Northern Italy There are people who speak German in many countries including the United States and Canada where many people emigrated from Germany In East Europe too in Bulgaria Romania Russia etc

German is a part of the West Germanic language family and is much like English and Dutch A lot of the vocabulary in German is related to English but the grammar is more complicated German has a system of cases and when helping verbs are used the main part of the verb must be moved to the end of the sentence For example Someone has stolen my car is Jemand hat mein Auto gestohlen or Someone called me last night is Jemand hat mich letzte Nacht angerufen

The Mississippi River is a river in the United States It is one of the longest rivers in the world 

The name Mississippi comes from a Native American name that means big river

The source of the Mississippi is in the state of Minnesota near the border with Canada The Mississippi flows south through the middle of the United States It flows past the states of Wisconsin Iowa Illinois Missouri Kentucky Tennessee Arkansas and Mississippi

The mouth of the Mississippi is in the state of Louisiana south of the city of New Orleans The Mississippi flows into the Gulf of Mexico

At the end of the Mississippi there is a zone in the Gulf of Mexico where very few animals can survive comfortably because of the fertilizer and other chemicals that run off of farms into the river and its tributaries which then dump them into the gulf

The Mississippi has been extremely important for transportation in the history of the United States In the 1800s many steamboats traveled on the Mississippi River St Louis Missouri Memphis Tennessee and New Orleans were important port cities

The Mississippi has many large tributaries or rivers that flow into it The watershed of the Mississippi covers much of the United States This means that the Mississippi and its tributaries drain much of the United States

Some important tributaries of the Mississippi are

A big part of the book Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain is set on the Mississippi River Twain also wrote a book called Life on the Mississippi which had some stories about how he used to work on a steamboat

A tributary of a river is another river that flows into it If one river flows into a second river then the first river is a tributary of the second river A tributary is a body of water that flows into another body of water

The opposite of a tributary is a distributary a river that branches off from the main flow of water

The Missouri River is a river in the western United States It is a tributary of the Mississippi River It is longer than the Mississippi River It is in fact the longest river in North America

For most of its course the Missouri flows across the Great Plains one of the driest parts of North America

The source of the Missouri River is in the Rocky Mountains in the state of Montana The Missouri flows eastward across Montana south of the border with Canada It enters the state of North Dakota and then it turns south It flows through South Dakota Then it flows past Iowa Nebraska Missouri and Kansas

Near the city of Kansas City Missouri the Missouri turns eastward into the state of Missouri It flows eastward across the state of Missouri It joins the Mississippi just north of the city of Saint Louis Missouri

The Missouri has many important tributaries including the Yellowstone River the Platte River and the Kansas River

The Missouri was very important for the Native Americans who lived on the Great Plains It was also very important in the history of the United States The Missouri was used as the route of the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1804 1806 In the 19th century the Missouri was very important in the North American fur trade and for transportation of army troops and supplies as well as general transportation and trade as the West was settled

The nickname of the Missouri is Big Muddy because it has a lot of silt

Many religions ways of thinking and creative artists have tried to find the Meaning of Life Some people say that we will never know what the meaning of life is Many religions claim to offer some answers There are also ways of thinking called philosophies which claim to answer this large question There are also artists who paint pictures or create sculptures to attempt to explain the meaning of lifeAs well there are musicians who write and play music and songs and writers who write novels and stories to try to explain the meaning of life

Many people from different religions or countries have different opinions on what the meaning of life is Life is like a big test and we are the students trying to prepare for the exam Some think it is all about the relationships that one holds throughout their lives Some people say that human nature is full of violence but on the other hand there are some people who say that life is full of happiness and peace Still other minds say that the meaning of life is to achieve goals you set throughout your existence According to The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams the ultimate answer to the question is 42 The biological answer is to have children which is to continue the survival of your genes Others say the meaning of life is simply to enjoy life and to enjoy every day

Watershed is a geographic term about rivers It is an area of land All water that falls on the watershed flows into one river It can flow directly into the river or go through tributaries first

The watershed of a river can be very large For example the watershed of the Mississippi River covers more than half of the United States That means that over half of the United States is drained by the Mississippi and its tributaries

The Great Plains is a series of big plains in Canada and the United States

A myth is a story that may or may not be true Myths are generally very old This means there are no records or other proof that they happened We know about them from older people telling them to younger people Some myths may have started as true stories but as people told and re told them they may have changed some parts so they are less true They may have changed them by mistake or to make them more interesting All cultures have myths Stories about the Greek and Roman gods and goddesses are myths

Many people once believed in mythological animals and gods These animals or gods may have control or has power over a part of human or natural life For example the Greek god named Zeus had powers over lightning and storms Whenever Zeus wanted to he could make a storm and that he made storms to show his anger Another example is that of the Egyptian god Atum who was said to be the creator of everything in the world In Hindu mythology the cause of thunderstorms was said to be the wrath of Indra the chief of all gods His most powerful weapon was the Vajra 1 or thunderbolt It was said that no one could survive after an attack from this weapon

All cultures have developed their own mythology over time Mythology includes the legends of their history their religions their stores of how the world was created and their heroes These stories have great symbolic power and this may be a major reason why they survive as long as they do sometimes for thousands of years

A collection of myths is called a mythos eg the Roman mythos A collection of those is called a mythoi eg the Greek and Roman mythoi

One important type of myth is the creation myth which describes how that culture believes the universe or world was created Scientists generally believe that the universe was created in an event called The Big Bang a natural event But now there is talk within the scientific community about what existed before the Big Bang To those are comfortable with the Big Bang as the ultimate or only solution to the question of the beginning of the universe the Big Bang may have itself become a myth Not so long ago the Milky Way was believed to be the only galaxy scientists then had trouble accepting other competing theories or ideas Myths are often final answers with great authority and strong emotional ties 

Another important and myth common to many cultures is the Trickster myth A trickster is a god or hero and very often an animal who plays tricks or jokes on humans in order to bring them wisdom or help them question their beliefs Examples of tricksters include the fox in Europe the crow and the coyote for North American natives the spider Anansi in Jamaica There are many more 

Joseph Campbell was considered by some people to be a leading Western authority on myth and the history of spirituality

Although myths are often considered to be stories of events that have not happened many historians think myths are about actual events that have become connected with strong symbolic meaning or that have been changed or shifted in time or place or even reversed One way of thinking about this process is to imagine myths as lying at the far end of an imaginary line At one end of the line is dispassionate account and legendary occurrence or mythical status is near the other end As an event progresses toward the mythical end of this line or continuum the way people think feel and say about the event changes It may gain greater historical significance while the facts become less important By the time one arrives at the mythical end of the line the story has taken on a life of its own and the facts of the original event have become almost unimportant

This happens partly because the events described are taken away from their original situation and put in a new situation often because it is similar to things happening at the moment Some Greek myths originated in Classical times to provide reasons for local cult practices to account for the local name of one of the Olympian gods to describe half remembered people things that happened to say why a deities has certain features or entheogens and sometimes to make sense of ancient icons On the other hand descriptions of recent events are made to seem to be like the more commonly known story This idea has been used by Right wing conservatives in America with text from the Bible and was used in the Russian Communist era in propaganda about situations with misleading links to struggles between the classes Even today the fitness of the Emperor of Japan is based partly on his distant descent from the Goddess of the Sun

Myths are not the same as fables folktales fairy tales anecdotes or simple fiction but sloppy usage has blurred the distinctions in many peoples minds The term myth is sometimes used pejoratively in reference to common beliefs of a culture or for the beliefs of a religion to imply that the story is both fanciful and fictional 

Myth is often used to refer to a commonly held but erroneous belief Compare urban myth the secular mythology of modern culture

The terms urban myth and urban legend are sometimes used to describe something that is false but strictly speaking those can be either true or false as well

The Minnesota River is a river in the United States It is in the northern United States in the state of Minnesota It is a tributary of the Mississippi River It is about 534 km long

The source of the river is a lake in western Minnesota The lake is called Big Stone Lake The lake is on the border between the state of Minnesota and the state of South Dakota From its source the Minnesota flows southeast At Mankato it turns northeast It joins the Mississippi just south of the cities of Saint Paul and Minneapolis

The Minnesota River was formed after the last ice age in North America

Mythology is the collection of myths for a culture A myth is a story or series of stories used to explain the world around you and describe what is happening such as why weather happens Myths usually have heroes gods and creatures that are bigger or more fantastic than real life Or even sometimes just normal people doing amazing things Such as greek myth Arachne who believed that she could weave far better than anyone among the lands including Athena so Athena challenged her to a duel A weaving duel Arachne lost then was turned into a spider hence the reason why spiders weave their webs

The Wisconsin River is a river in the United States It is a tributary of the Mississippi River It is located in the state of Wisconsin It is approximately 692 km long

The source of the Wisconsin is in the forests of northern Wisconsin The source is a small lake on the border between Wisconsin and Michigan The river flows south across Wisconsin It flows through a plain made by a glacier during the last ice age It passes the cities of Wausau and Stevens Point

In southern Wisconsin the river meets a moraine The moraine was made during the last ice age The river enters a beautiful gorge called the Wisconsin Dells North of the city of Madison the river turns to the west It flows west through the hills of southwest Wisconsin It joins the Mississippi 15 km south of the city of Prairie du Chien

The river is an important source of hydroelectric power

The State of Alaska is one of the states of the United States It is one of two states that does not touch another state The other is Hawaii It was purchased from Imperial Russia in 1867 for 72 million

The capital city is Juneau but the biggest city is Anchorage Alaska is the biggest state in the United States but it almost has the least people Alaska has almost 20 of all the land in the US but only about 02 of the people It is not connected to any other states by American land but it is connected to Canada

Alaska has many glaciers some of which are can be seen from passing cruise ships Some are coastal and others are not by the ocean It is a popular tourist destination as there is a very rich culture along with beautiful scenery There are many wild animals in Alaska Some of them are the brown bear the moose and the wolf

There are some important industries in Alaska like oil fishing mining and forestry Oil is the biggest industry in Alaska Most of the oil is very far north in the Alaskan arctic A very long pipeline starts at the northern coast of Alaska and runs to the southern coast It is over 800 miles long There were many gold rushes in Alaska

The BBC or the British Broadcasting Corporation is an organisation in the UK It broadcasts in the United Kingdom and other countries on television radio and the Internet The BBC also sells its programmes to other broadcasting companies in the world

The organisation is run by a group of twelve governors who have been given the job by the Queen on the advice of government ministers The governors appoint a Board of Management to take care of running the business of the BBC The head of the Board of Management is called the Director General

The BBC is established under a Royal Charter which allows the BBC to broadcast In 2006 the British Government looked at the charter to see if it needed changing

Another agreement which goes with the Charter recognizes that the BBC should be independent from any other organization It also says what the BBC should do for the people in Britain

Every house in the UK that has a television must pay for a TV Licence Because the BBC gets its money from TV licences it does not take money from companies or shareholders so it does not have to do what they want Also it is not allowed to broadcast commercials

The BBC makes extra money in several ways One way is by selling its programmes to other broadcasting companies Another way is by selling audio tapes and CDs of its best radio programmes and videos and DVDs of its best television programmes Still another way is by selling books based on programmes and magazines about science and natural history

In 1923 BBC Magazines started publishing a magazine which printed listings of the weeks BBC radio and television programmes in the United Kingdom The magazine was called the Radio Times In 1991 the magazine began to print listings of programmes broadcast by other providers in the United Kingdom Today the magazine is still printed and provides online listings too It also prints stories about programmes the people who make them and the people who appear in them The Radio Times is one of the best selling magazines in the United Kingdom In August 2011 the BBC agreed to sell the magazine to Exponent if Britains Office of Fair Trading approves

The BBC has to publish a report every year which tells people what it has done and how much money it has made and spent

If someone has a complaint about something broadcast by the BBC they can complain to the BBC the BBC Trust or directly to Ofcom the governments regulator of broadcasting

The headquarters of the BBC is Broadcasting House in Portland Place London The BBC also has other offices such as the BBC Television Centre in White City London as well in other cities like Cardiff Belfast Glasgow Birmingham Manchester Bristol Southampton and Newcastle upon Tyne Rather than hire local reporters everywhere the BBCs journalists work in many countries across the world This means BBC workers are sometimes in danger especially in war zones Most recently Alan Johnston was kidnapped and held hostage for many months in Gaza before being safely released

Between October 2005 and 28 February 2006 the BBC offered a service called the BBC iPlayer on their website  bbccouk It allowed people to catch up on the last seven days of TV and radio on the BBC Users could either watch it or download the content on their computers The downloading option was only for Microsoft Windows computers The iPlayer service was released to the public on 25 December 2007 The slogan for BBC iPlayer is Making the Unmissable Unmissable

The Illinois River is a river in the United States It is in the state of Illinois It is an important tributary of the Mississippi River The length of the river is about 439 km

The source of the river is in northeastern Illinois near the city of Joliet It flows east across Illinois then southeast It passes the city of Peoria the largest city on the river

It flows into southwestern Illinois It joins the Mississippi River 40 km north of Saint Louis Missouri There is separate Illinois river that runs through the northernmost edge of Oklahoma

The river was used for transportation by the Native Americans It was also used by early French trappers It was an important route between the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes

In the 19th century a canal was built that connected the river to Lake Michigan Large ships now use this canal to go from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River The canal goes through the city of Chicago It is one of the reasons that Chicago became a big city

Milk is a white liquid made by mammals for example cows dogs and humans It is made in the mammary glands of female mammals Because newborn babies have no teeth they must be given milk before they can eat solid food Milk has many nutrients to help babies grow and be healthy

If milk is not kept cold in a refrigerator it will become sour after some time When milk is warmed it turns sour Fermentation makes this happen Lactic acid bacteria changes the milk sugar into lactic acid Fermentation is used when making dairy products 

Milk is often pasteurised before humans drink it It is made into dairy products like cream butter yoghurt ice cream gelato or cheese Pasteurised cows milk will turn sour if it is not kept in a refrigerator Milk should be stored between 1 and 4 Celsius If milk is treated with very high temperatures it will last longer before spoiling This means it does not have to be put in the refrigerator until it is opened

Milk contains a chemical called lactose Babies make an enzyme called lactase inside their bodies Adults make less lactase If they do not have enough they may not be able to digest lactose anymore This problem is called lactose intolerance and it affects many adults There are many medicines that help adults digest lactose Many lactose intolerant people drink soy milk instead of animal milk because it does not contain lactose Soy milk is similar to animal milk but it is made from soybeans

Goats milk is the milk from a goat It can be drunk both by humans or baby goats or cheese can be made from it This cheese is called goats milk cheese

Coconut milk looks similar to real milk but it does not have as many nutrients It is made by removing the white meat from a coconut pressing or squeezing the meat then adding water It is sometimes used in cooking for example in Thai curry Coconut cream is a thicker version of coconut milk which contains added sugar

Milk forms an important part of a persons daily balanced diet It contains a lot of calcium that helps bones and teeth to grow stronger Also milk provides the body with high quality proteins and helps in meeting the bodys requirement for vitamins One glass of milk gives about 44 to the daily recommended vitamins intake Some kind of milks though do not have good calcium These kind of milk products include cream cottage cheese ricotta cheese and cream cheese

Weather is what happens in the sky Weather includes wind lightning storms hurricanes tornados rain hail snow and lots more Energy from the sun affects the weather Climate tells us what kinds of weather usually happen in an area at different times of the year Changes in weather can affect our mood We wear different clothes and do different things in different weather conditions We choose different foods in different seasons like ice cream in the summer or hot chocolate in the winter

Weather stations around the world measure different parts of weather Ways to measure weather are wind speed wind direction temperature barometric pressure and humidity People try to use these measurements to figure out what the weather will be in the future These people are called meteorologists They use computers to build large mathematical models to follow weather trends

Bad weather can hurt people and their property It can also just be a bother Some examples of bad weather are

British Columbia is on the west coast of Canada It is the third largest Canadian province with 944735 square kilometers or 364764 square miles In the 2006 census the population was 4113487

The capital of British Columbia is Victoria The largest city is Vancouver It has 2 million people in it Other large cities include Kelowna Abbotsford Kamloops Nanaimo and Prince George

The largest industries are forestry tourism mining and fisheries

The province joined Canada in 1871 There were some disagreements with the United States about where to make the borders The southern border is on the 49th parallel as agreed to in the Oregon Treaty of 1846 The San Juan Islands and Alaska Panhandle also created conflicts but they were resolved

The premier of BC is Gordon Campbell and is the leader the BC Liberal Party

BC is next to the Pacific Ocean as well as the province of Alberta the Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories and the American states of Washington Idaho and Montana The Rocky Mountains are in eastern BC The Okanagan is a fruit farming area in the south central part of the province known as the interior

There are many First Nations groups in British Columbia The Nisgaa agreement in the year 2000 was BCs first modern land claims treaty

The Winter Olympics were held in Vancouver in 2010 Skiing was held at Whistler which is one of the best known places for skiing in North America

The 20th century is the century from the year 1901 to 2000 Many events have happened during this time including two world wars and advances such as industrialization The human population of Earth has also increased more during this century than any previous one

Brussels is the capital city of Belgium and the European Union 

In 2007 its population the people living in it was 145917 But the area around it known as the Brussels Capital Region had 1031215 people

The people of Brussels speak mainly French and Flemish But there are lots of other languages spoken as well because the European Union offices are there

The city is located at 50 50 North 04 21 East

Many popular European comics came from Brussels such as 

It is also well known for a style of building known as Art Nouveau

The vegetables Brussels sprouts are named after the city and Brussels is also famous for its waffles and its chocolates

A lot of tourists visit Brussels for Manneke Pis

Thuringia is a Bundesland of Germany It lies in central Germany and has an area of convert16251km2sqmi1lkonabbron This means Thuringia is the sixth smallest state in Germany by area It has 245 million inhabitants so it is the fifth smallest state in Germany by population The capital is Erfurt

Thuringia borders on the German states of Lower Saxony Saxony Anhalt Saxony Bavaria and Hesse The most conspicuous geographical feature of Thuringia is the Thuringia Forest In the northwest Thuringia includes a small part of the Harz mountains The Saale river runs through Jena The biggest mountain in Thuringia is with 982m the Groer Beerberg in the Thuringia Forest

The Free State of Saxony is one of 16 states of Germany It is located in south east north of Czech Republic To the east of Saxony is Poland The biggest city is Leipzig The capital is called Dresden It was new founded in 1990

Saxony is the border of Germany to the two countries Poland and Czech Republic In the north of Saxony is Brandenburg another German state Saxnoys west border is to Saxony Anhalt Thuringia and Bavaria A big part of the border to the Czech Republic are the Ore Mountains in the south of Saxony

Saxony is divided into 3 administrative districts These are subdivided into 10 districts

Saxony has three urban districts which do not belong to the rural districts

The first Free State of Saxony was founded in 1918 after the first World War After the second World War in 1945 the country of Saxony was founded Later the Country was divided into 3 administrative divisions of the German Democratic Republic and thus robbed of its sovereignty

In 1990 the Free State of Saxony was officially re founded as a part of Germany

Windows Internet Explorer is a series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft It was included as part of the Microsoft Windows operating system starting in 1995 It was first released as part of the add on package Microsoft Plus for Windows 95 that year Later versions were available as free downloads or in service packs and included in releases of Windows 95 and later versions of Windows

IE has been the most widely used web browser since 1999 attaining a peak of about 95 usage share during 20022003 with IE5 and IE6 Since its peak of popularity its usage share has declined in the face of renewed competition from other web browsers to 55 and is slowly trending downward Microsoft spent over 100 million per year on IE in the late 1990s with over 1000 people working on it by 1999

The latest release is Internet Explorer 9 Internet Explorer was originally planned to be omitted from Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 in Europe but Microsoft later dropped the plans and instead included a browser ballot screen with the products allowing users to select a different web browser if they wish

Versions of Internet Explorer for other operating systems have also been produced including an embedded OEM version called Internet Explorer for Windows CE available for WinCE based platforms and currently based on IE6 Internet Explorer for Pocket PC later rebranded Internet Explorer Mobile which is made for Windows Mobile and Windows CE and remains in development alongside the more advanced desktop versions and the discontinued Internet Explorer for Mac and Internet Explorer for UNIX

The Internet Explorer project was started in the summer of 1994 by Thomas Reardon using source code from Spyglass Inc Mosaic an early commercial web browser with formal ties to the pioneering NCSA Mosaic browser In late 1994 Microsoft licensed Spyglass Mosaic for a quarterly fee plus a percentage of Microsofts non Windows revenues for the software Although bearing a name similar to NCSA Mosaic the Spyglass Mosaic had used the NCSA Mosaic source code sparingly

Internet Explorer 1 made its debut on August 16 1995 It was a reworked version of Spyglass Mosaic which Microsoft had licensed like many other companies initiating browser development from Spyglass Inc It came with Microsoft Plus for Windows 95 and the OEM release of Windows 95 It was installed as part of the Internet Jumpstart Kit in Plus The Internet Explorer team began with about six people in early development Internet Explorer 15 was released several months later for Windows NT and added support for basic table rendering However by including it for free on their OS they did not have to pay royalties to Spyglass Inc which resulted in a lawsuit and a multi million USD settlement

Internet Explorer 2 was released for Windows 95 Windows NT 35 and NT 40 on November 22 1995 It featured support for SSL cookies VRML RSA and Internet newsgroups Version 2 was also the first release for Windows 31 and Macintosh System 701 although the Mac version was not released until January 1996 for PPC and April for 68k Version 21 for the Mac came out in August 1996 although by this time Windows was getting 30 Version 2 was included in Windows 95 OSR 1 and Microsofts Internet Starter Kit for Windows 95 in early 1996 It launched with twelve languages including English but this expanded to 24 20 and 9 for Win 95 Win 31 and Mac respectively by April 1996 The 20i version supported double byte character set

Internet Explorer 3 was released on August 13 1996 and went on to be much more popular than its predecessors Internet Explorer 3 was the first major browser with CSS support although this support was only partial It also introduced support for ActiveX controls Java applets inline multimedia and the PICS system for content metadata Version 3 also came bundled with Internet Mail and News NetMeeting and an early version of the Windows Address Book and was itself included with Windows 95 OSR 2 Version 3 proved to be the first more popular version of Internet Explorer which brought with it increased scrutiny In the months following its release a number of security and privacy vulnerabilities were found by researchers and hackers This version of Internet Explorer was the first to have the blue e logo The Internet Explorer team consisted of roughly 100 people during the development of three months The first major IE security hole the Princeton Word Macro Virus Loophole was discovered on August 22 1996 in IE3 Backwards compatibility was handled by allowing users who upgraded to IE3 to still use the last IE because the installation converted the previous version to a separate directory

Internet Explorer 4 released in September 1997 deepened the level of integration between the web browser and the underlying operating system Installing version 4 on a Windows 95 or Windows NT 4 machine and choosing Windows Desktop Update would result in the traditional Windows Explorer also being replaced by a version more akin to a web browser interface as well as the Windows desktop itself being web enabled via Active Desktop The integration with Windows however was subject to numerous packaging criticisms This option was no longer available with the installers for later versions of Internet Explorer but was not removed from the system if already installed Internet Explorer 4 introduced support for Group Policy allowing companies to configure and lock down many aspects of the browsers configuration as well as support for offline browsing Internet Mail and News was replaced with Outlook Express and Microsoft Chat and an improved NetMeeting were also included This version also was included with Windows 98 New features were added that allow you to save and retrieve posts in comment forms which are still not being used today Internet Explorer 45 offered new features such as easier 128 bit encryption It also offered a dramatic stability improvement over prior versions particularly the 68k version which was especially prone to freezing

Internet Explorer 5 launched on March 18 1999 and subsequently included with Windows 98 Second Edition and bundled with Office 2000 was another significant release that supported bi directional text ruby characters XML XSLT and the ability to save web pages in MHTML format IE5 was bundled with Outlook Express 5 Also with the release of Internet Explorer 50 Microsoft released the first version of XMLHttpRequest giving birth to Ajax It was the last with a 16 bit version Internet Explorer 501 a bug fix version was released in December 1999 Windows 2000 includes this version Internet Explorer 55 followed in July 2000 improving its print preview capabilities CSS and HTML standards support and developer APIs this version was bundled with Windows Me However version 5 was the last version for Mac and UNIX Version 55 was the last to have Compatibility Mode which allowed Internet Explorer 4 to be run side by side with the 5x The IE team consisted of over 1000 people by 1999 with funding on the order of 100 million USD per year

Internet Explorer 6 was released on August 27 2001 a few months before Windows XP This version included DHTML enhancements content restricted inline frames and partial support of CSS level 1 DOM level 1 and SMIL 20 The MSXML engine was also updated to version 30 Other new features included a new version of the Internet Explorer Administration Kit Media bar Windows Messenger integration fault collection automatic image resizing P3P and a new look and feel that was in line with the Luna visual style of Windows XP when used in Windows XP Internet Explorer 60 SP1 offered several security enhancements and coincided with the Windows XP SP1 patch release In 2002 the Gopher protocol was disabled and support for it was dropped in Internet Explorer 7 Internet Explorer 60 SV1 came out August 6 2004 for Windows XP SP2 and offered various security enhancements and new color buttons on the user interface IE6 updated the original blue e logo to a lighter blue and more 3D look Microsoft now considers IE6 to be an obsolete product and recommends that users upgrade to IE8 Many corporate IT users have not upgraded despite this

Internet Explorer 7 was released on October 18 2006 It includes bug fixes enhancements to its support for web standards tabbed browsing with tab preview and management a multiple engine search box a web feeds reader Internationalized Domain Name support Extended Validation Certificate support and anti phishing filter With IE7 Internet Explorer has been decoupled from the Windows Shell  unlike previous versions the Internet Explorer ActiveX control is not hosted in the Windows Explorer process but rather runs in a separate Internet Explorer process It is included with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 and is available for Windows XP Service Pack 2 and later and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 and later The original release of Internet Explorer 7 required the computer to pass a Windows Genuine Advantage validation check prior to installing but on October 5 2007 Microsoft removed this requirement As some statistics show by mid 2008 Internet Explorer 7 market share exceeded that of Internet Explorer 6 in a number of regions

Internet Explorer 8 was released on March 19 2009 It had been in development since August 2007 at the latest On March 5 2008 the first public beta was released to the general public On August 27 2008 the second public beta was released It is supported in Windows XP SP2 and SP3 Windows Server 2003 SP2 Windows Vista Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 on both 32 bit as well as 64 bit architectures Internet Explorer 8 RC1 was released on January 26 2009 Internet Explorer 8 Final was released on March 19 2009 Security ease of use and improvements in RSS CSS and Ajax support are Microsofts priorities for IE8 It includes much stricter compliance with web standards including a planned full Cascading Style Sheets 21 compliance for the release version All these changes allow Internet Explorer 8 to pass the Acid2 test However to prevent compatibility issues IE8 also includes the IE7 rendering behavior Sites that expect IE7 quirks can disable IE8s breaking changes by including a meta element in the HEAD section of the HTML document IE8 also includes numerous improvements to JavaScript support as well as performance improvements although it still does not pass the Acid3 test with version 80 scoring 20100 It includes support for Accelerators  which allow supported web applications to be invoked without explicitly navigating to them  and WebSlices  which allows portions of page to be subscribed to and monitored from a redesigned Favorites Bar Other features include InPrivate privacy features and SmartScreen phishing filter

Internet Explorer 9 was released on March 14 2011 It will have complete or nearly complete support for all CSS 3 selectors border radius CSS 3 property faster JavaScript embedded ICC v2 or v4 color profiles and hardware accelerated rendering using Direct2D and DirectWrite Microsoft has confirmed that Web Open Font Format will also be supported WOFF is a strong favorite for standardization by the Web Fonts Working Group of W3C IE9 is supposed to fix many issues with Internet Explorer including support of the CSS3 standard border radius property which means that people using IE9 will be able to see rounded corners the same way people using Firefox can

Microsoft has continued to downplay the importance of passing the Acid3 test but speculation that IE9 would support the SVG W3C recommendation was ignited when Microsoft announced they had joined the SVG Working Group At MIX 10 the first IE9 Platform Preview was released which featured support for CSS3 and SVG a new JScript engine called Chakra and a score of 55100 on the Acid3 test up from 20100 for IE8 On May 5 2010 the second IE9 Platform Preview was released which featured a score of 68100 on the Acid3 test and faster performance on the WebKit SunSpider JavaScript benchmark than the first IE9 Platform Preview On June 23 2010 the third IE9 Platform Preview was released which scores 83100 on the Acid3 test and introduced support for  and elements and WOFF On August 4 2010 the fourth IE9 Platform Preview was released which features a score of 95100 on the Acid3 test and a faster JScript engine than the third IE9 Platform Preview The final build of IE9 is expected to be released in 2011 Support for the HTML5 video and audio tags was also promised Some industry experts predict that Microsoft will release IE9 as a major out of band version that is not tied to any particular version of Windows According to the Internet Explorer 9 Test Drive page Cite weburlhttpiemicrosoftcomtestdrive titleInternet Explorer 9 Test Drive author date work publishermicrosoftcomaccessdate the system requirements for IE9 are Windows Vista SP2 or Windows 7 On August 12 2010 Microsoft announced that the IE9 Public Beta would launch on September 15 2010 at a special event in San Francisco linked to the idea of beauty of the web It was also confirmed that the browser would only function with Windows Vista and Windows 7 On September 15 2010 Microsoft launched the IE9 Public Beta

Microsoft has announced development of a new Internet Explorer 10 saying that it was already 3 weeks in development during the MIX 11 When Internet Explorer 10 is released it would not work with Windows Vista but only for Windows 7 and a future release of the Windows operating system

Internet Explorer has been designed to view a broad range of web pages and to provide certain features within the operating system including Microsoft Update During the heyday of the browser wars Internet Explorer superseded Netscape only when it caught up technologically to support the progressive features of the time

Internet Explorer using the Trident layout engine

Internet Explorer uses DOCTYPE sniffing to choose between standards mode and a quirks mode in which it deliberately mimicks nonstandard behaviors of old versions of MSIE for HTML and CSS rendering on screen It also provides its own dialect of ECMAScript called JScript

Internet Explorer has been subjected to criticism by W3C over its limited support for SVG promoted by W3C

Internet Explorer has introduced an array of proprietary extensions to many of the standards including HTML CSS and the DOM This has resulted in a number of web pages that appear broken in standards compliant web browsers and has introduced the need for a quirks mode to allow for rendering improper elements meant for Internet Explorer in these other browsers

Internet Explorer has introduced a number of extensions to JScript which have been adopted by other browsers These include the innerHTML property which returns the HTML string within an element the XMLHttpRequest object which allows the sending of HTTP request and receiving of HTTP response and the designMode attribute of the contentDocument object which enables rich text editing of HTML documents Some of these functionalities were not possible until the introduction of the W3C DOM methods Its Ruby character extension to HTML is also accepted as a module in W3C XHTML 11 though it is not found in all versions of W3C HTML

Microsoft submitted several other features of IE for consideration by the W3C for standardization These include the behavior CSS property which connects the HTML elements with JScript behaviors HTMLTIME profile which adds timing and media synchronization support to HTML documents and the VML vector graphics file format However all were rejected at least in their original forms VML was however subsequently combined with PGML resulting in the W3C approved SVG format currently one of the few vector image formats being used on the web and which IE is now virtually unique in not supporting

Other non standard behaviors include support for vertical text but in a syntax different from W3C CSS3 candidate recommendation Support for a variety of image effects and page transitions which are not found in W3C CSS Support for obfuscated script code in particular JScriptEncode Support for embedding EOT fonts in web pages

The favicon introduced by Internet Explorer is now also supported and extended in other browsers It allows web pages to specify a 16 by 16 pixel image for use in bookmarks In IE support was and still is provided only for the native Windows ICO format in other browsers it has now been extended to other types of images such as PNG and GIF

Internet Explorer makes use of the accessibility framework provided in Windows Internet Explorer is also a user interface for FTP with operations similar to that of Windows Explorer Pop up blocking and tabbed browsing were added respectively in Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7 Tabbed browsing can also be added to older versions by installing MSN Search Toolbar or Yahoo Toolbar

Internet Explorer caches visited content in the Temporary Internet Files folder to allow quicker access to previously visited pages The content is indexed in a database file known as Indexdat Multiple Indexdat files exist which index different content  visited content web feeds visited URLs cookies etc

Prior to IE7 clearing the cache used to clear the index but the files themselves were not reliably removed posing a potential security and privacy risk In IE7 and later when the cache is cleared the cache files are more reliably removed and the indexdat file is overwritten with null bytes

Internet Explorer is fully configurable using Group Policy Administrators of Windows Server domains can apply and enforce a variety of settings that affect the user interface as well as underlying security features such as downloading of files zone configuration per site settings ActiveX control behavior and others Policy settings can be configured for each user and for each machine Internet Explorer also supports Integrated Windows Authentication

Internet Explorer uses a componentized architecture built on the Component Object Model technology It consists of several major components each of which is contained in a separate Dynamic link library and exposes a set of COM programming interfaces hosted by the Internet Explorer main executable iexploreexe

Internet Explorer does not include any native scripting functionality Rather MSHTMLdll exposes an API that permit a programmer to develop a scripting environment to be plugged in and to access the DOM tree Internet Explorer 8 includes the bindings for the Active Scripting engine which is a part of Microsoft Windows and allows any language implemented as an Active Scripting module to be used for client side scripting By default only the JScript and VBScript modules are provided third party implementations like ScreamingMonkey can also be used Microsoft also makes available the Microsoft Silverlight runtime that allows CLI languages including DLR based dynamic languages like IronPython and IronRuby to be used for client side scripting

Internet Explorer 8 introduces some major architectural changes called Loosely Coupled IE LCIE separates the main window process from the processes hosting the different web applications in different tabs A frame process can create multiple tab processes each of which can be of a different integrity level each tab process can host multiple web sites The processes use asynchronous Inter Process Communication to synchronize themselves Generally there will be a single frame process for all web sites In Windows Vista with Protected Mode turned on however opening privileged content will create a new tab process as it will not be constrained by Protected Mode

Internet Explorer exposes a set of Component Object Model interfaces that allow other components to extend the functionality of the browser Extensibility is divided into two types Browser extensibility and Content extensibility The browser extensibility interfaces can be used to plug in components to add context menu entries toolbars menu items or Browser Helper Objects BHOs are used to extend the feature set of the browser whereas the other extensibility options are used to expose the feature in the UI Content extensibility interfaces are used by different content type handlers to add support for non native content formats BHOs not only have unrestricted access to the Internet Explorer DOM and event model they also can access the filesystem registry and other OS components Content extensibility can be either in terms of Active Documents or ActiveX controls ActiveX controls are used for content handlers that render content embedded within an HTML page Doc objects are used when the content type will not be embedded in HTML In fact the Trident rendering engine is itself exposed as a Doc object so HTML in itself is treated as an Active Document

Internet Explorer add on components run with the same privileges as the browser itself unlike client side scripts that have a very limited set of privileges Add ons can be installed either locally or directly by a web site Since the add ons have a more privileged access to the system malicious add ons can and have been used to compromise the security of the system Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 2 onwards provide various safeguards against this including an Add on Manager for controlling ActiveX controls and Browser Helper Objects and a No Add Ons mode of operation as well as greater restrictions on sites installing add ons

Internet Explorer itself can be hosted by other applications via a set of COM interfaces This can be used to embed the browser functionality inside the application Also the hosting application can choose to host only the MSHTMLdll rendering engine rather than the entire browser

Internet Explorer uses a zone based security framework that groups sites based on certain conditions including whether it is an Internet or intranet based site as well as a user editable whitelist Security restrictions are applied per zone all the sites in a zone are subject to the restrictions

Internet Explorer 6 SP2 onwards uses the Attachment Execution Service of Microsoft Windows to mark executable files downloaded from the Internet as being potentially unsafe Accessing files marked as such will prompt the user to make an explicit trust decision to execute the file as executables originating from the Internet can be potentially unsafe This helps in preventing accidental installation of malware

Internet Explorer 7 introduced the phishing filter that restricts access to phishing sites unless the user overrides the decision With version 8 it also blocks access to sites known to host malware Downloads are also checked to see if they are known to be malware infected

In Windows Vista Internet Explorer by default runs in what is called Protected Mode where the privileges of the browser itself are severely restricted  it cannot make any system wide changes One can optionally turn this mode off but this is not recommended This also effectively restricts the privileges of any add ons As a result even if the browser or any add on is compromised the damage the security breach can cause is limited

Patches and updates to the browser are released periodically and made available through the Windows Update service as well as through Automatic Updates Although security patches continue to be released for a range of platforms most feature additions and security infrastructure improvements are only made available on operating systems which are in Microsofts mainstream support phase

On December 16 2008 Trend Micro recommended users switch to rival browsers until an emergency IE patch was released to fix a potential security risk which could allow outside users to take control of a persons computer and steal their passwords Microsoft representatives countered this recommendation claiming that 002 of internet sites were affected by the flaw

On December 17 2008 a fix to the security problem above became available with the release of the Security Update for Internet Explorer KB960714 which is available from Microsoft Windows Updates webpage Microsoft has said that this update fixes the security risk found by Trend Micro the previous day

Internet Explorer has been subjected to many security vulnerabilities and concerns Much of the spyware adware and computer viruses across the Internet are made possible by exploitable bugs and flaws in the security architecture of Internet Explorer sometimes requiring nothing more than viewing of a malicious web page in order to install themselves This is known as a drive by install There are also attempts to trick the user into installing malicious software by misrepresenting the softwares true purpose in the description section of an ActiveX security alert

A number of security flaws affecting IE originated not in the browser itself but ActiveX based add ons used by it Because the add ons have the same privilege as IE the flaws can be as critical as browser flaws This has led to the ActiveX based architecture being criticized for being fault prone By 2005 some experts maintained that the dangers of ActiveX have been overstated and there were safeguards in place In 2006 new techniques using automated testing found more than a hundred vulnerabilities in standard Microsoft ActiveX components Security features introduced in then recently released Internet Explorer 7 mitigated some of these vulnerabilities

Internet Explorer in 2008 had a number of published security vulnerabilities  According to research done by security research firm Secunia Microsoft did not respond as quickly as its competitors in fixing security holes and making patches available The firm also reported 366 vulnerabilities in ActiveX controls an increase from the prior year

According to the latest information Secunia reports that IE6 has 24 known unpatched vulnerabilities IE7 has 11 and IE8 has 4 The most severe unpatched Secunia advisories affecting Microsoft Internet Explorer 6x 7x and 8x with all vendor patches applied are all rated Extremely critical The oldest known unpatched vulnerabilities for IE6 IE7 and IE8 date from November 7 2003 June 6 2006 and February 26 2007 respectively

According to the latest information security research firm SecurityFocus reports that IE6 has 396 known unpatched vulnerabilities IE7 has 22 and IE8 has 25 The oldest known unpatched vulnerabilities for IE6 IE7 and IE8 date from November 20 2000 May 17 2007 and April 11 2009 respectively

In an advisory on January 14 2010 Microsoft said that attackers targeting Google and other US companies used software that exploits a security hole which had already been patched in Internet Explorer The vulnerability affected Internet Explorer 6 IE7 and IE8 on Windows 7 Vista Windows XP Server 2003 and Server 2008 R2 as well as IE 6 Service Pack 1 on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4

The German government warned users against using Internet Explorer and recommended switching to an alternative web browser due to the major security hole described above that was exploited in Internet Explorer The Australian and French Government issued a similar warning a few days later The first browser they recommended was Mozilla Firefox followed by Google Chrome

The adoption rate of Internet Explorer seems to be closely related to that of Microsoft Windows as it is the default web browser that comes with Windows Since the integration of Internet Explorer 20 with Windows 95 OSR 1 in 1996 and especially after version 40s release the adoption was greatly accelerated from below 20 in 1996 to about 40 in 1998 and over 80 in 2000

A CNN article noted at the release of Internet Explorer 4 Microsofts Internet Explorer has made inroads and various estimates put its share of the browser market 30 to 35 percent from about 10 percent a year ago By 2002 Internet Explorer had almost completely superseded its main rival Netscape and dominated the market with up to 95 percent market share

After having fought and won the browser wars of the late 1990s Internet Explorer gained almost total dominance of the browser market Having attained a peak of about 95 during 2002 and 2003 its market share has since declined at a slow but steady pace This is mainly due to the adoption of Mozilla Firefox which statistics indicate is currently the most significant competition Nevertheless Internet Explorer remains the dominant web browser with a global usage share of around 60 Usage is higher in Asia and lower in Europe

Firefox 10 had surpassed Internet Explorer 5 in early 2005 with Firefox 10 at roughly 8 percent market share An article notes at the release of Internet Explorer 7 in October 2006 that IE6 had the lions share of the browser market with 7722 Internet Explorer 7 had climbed to 318 while Firefox 20 was at 069

Internet Explorer 7 was released at the same time as Firefox 20 and overtook Firefox 1x by November 2006 at roughly 9 market share Firefox 20 had overtaken 1x by January 2007 but IE7 did not surpass IE6 until December 2007 By January 2008 their respective version market share stood at 43 IE7 32 IE6 16 FF2 4 Safari 3 and both FF1x and IE5 versions at less than half a percent

Approximate usage over time based on various usage share counters averaged for the year overall or for the fourth quarter or for the last month in the year depending on availability of reference

Approximate usage over time based on various usage share counters averaged for the year overall or for the fourth quarter or for the last month in the year depending on availability of reference IE was at its peak in 2003 with 94 of the worldwide internet browsers but started falling in 2004 and since has hit a 2000s decade low in 2011 with only 497 of worldwide internet users

The ActiveX extension mechanism is used by many public websites and web applications including eBay Citation neededdateSeptember 2010 Similarly Browser Helper Objects are also used by many search engine companies and third parties for creating add ons that access their services such as search engine toolbars Because of the use of COM it is possible to embed web browsing functionality in third party applications Hence there are a number of Internet Explorer shells and a number of content centric applications like RealPlayer also use Internet Explorers web browsing module for viewing web pages within the applications

IE versions over time have had widely varying OS compatibility ranging from being available for many platforms and several versions of Windows to only a few versions of Windows Many versions of IE had some support for an older OS but stopped getting updates The increased growth of the Internet in the 1990s and 2000s means that current browsers with small market shares have more total users than the entire market early on For example 90 market share in 1997 would be roughly 60 million users but by the start of 2007 90 market share would equate to over 900 million users The result is that later versions of IE6 had many more users in total than all the early versions put together

The release of IE7 at the end of 2006 resulted in a collapse of IE6 market share by February 2007 market version share statistics showed IE6 at about 50 and IE7 at 29 Regardless of the actual market share the most compatible version of IE was 5x which had Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X Unix and most Windows versions available and supported for a short period in the late 1990s By 2007 IE had much narrower OS support with the latest versions supporting only Windows XP Service Pack 2 and above Internet Explorer 50 55 60 and 70 have also been unofficially ported to the Linux operating system from the project IEs4Linux

Early versions of Internet Explorer such as 5 had a compatibility mode to run Internet Explorer 4 though this feature was dropped While Microsoft claims it is impossible to keep multiple versions of Internet Explorer on the same machine some hackers have successfully separated several versions of Internet Explorer making them standalone applications These are referred to as standalone IEs and have included versions 3 through 7

Microsoft has discontinued standalone installers for Internet Explorer to the general public However there are unofficial procedures for downloading the complete install package Internet Explorer standalone uses a feature introduced in Windows 2000 called DLL redirection to force it to load older DLLs than the ones installed on the system

It is also possible to install Internet Explorer via Wine

After Internet Explorer 7 is installed an Internet Explorer 6 executable is still available in CWINDOWSie7 hidden by default Launching this executable provides the user with the older IE6 interface however web pages are rendered using the IE7 engine The IE6 engine can be re enabled by placing a file named iexploreexelocal into the IE7 folder

As an alternative to using IE standalone Microsoft now makes available Microsoft Virtual PC images containing pre activated copies of Windows XP with either IE 6 or IE 7 installed Microsoft recommends this approach for web developers seeking to test their pages in the different versions of IE as the standalone versions are unsupported and may not work the same way as a properly installed copy of IE

While a major upgrade of Internet Explorer can be uninstalled in a traditional way if the user has saved the original application files for installation the matter of uninstalling the version of the browser that has shipped with an operating system remains a controversial one

The idea of removing a stock install of Internet Explorer from a Windows system was proposed during the United States v Microsoft court case One of Microsofts arguments during the trial was that removing Internet Explorer from Windows may result in system instability

Removing Internet Explorer does have a number of consequences Applications that depend on libraries installed by IE will fail to function or have unexpected behaviors The Windows help and support system will also not function due to the heavy reliance on HTML help files and components of IE In versions of Windows before Vista it is also not possible to run Microsofts Windows Update or Microsoft Update with any other browser due to the services implementation of an ActiveX control which no other browser supports In Windows Vista Windows Update is implemented as a Control Panel applet

With Windows 7 Microsoft added the ability to safely remove Internet Explorer 8 from Windows Microsoft does not allow the dependencies to be removed through this process but the Internet Explorer executable is removed without harming any other Windows components

The Duck billed platypus is a small mammal of the order Monotremata It lives in eastern Australia

It lives in rivers and on river banks It is one of only two families of mammals which lay eggs The other is the Echidna which has four species The platypus was first described in detail in the early 19th century but it took a while before biologists in England believed what they were reading

These mammals are called monotremes because they have a common rear opening known as the cloaca Through this opening faeces and urine are voided and sexual activity takes place This is a primitive feature of tetrapods which monotremes birds and reptiles have today The more advanced mammals have the system where the rear has two openings

The plural of Platypus is just Platypus

The platypus looks similar to a beaver with a brown furry body and wide flat tail Unlike a beaver it has webbed feet which are good for swimming Its nose is large and rubbery The platypus is sometimes called duck billed platypus because of this nose It is similar to a ducks bill Platypuses can be big or small The larger platypus live in Tasmania while the smaller ones live in Queensland Adults can be less than convert1kglb0lkonabbron or up to convert3kglb0lkonabbron Its body can be from convert30cmin0lkonabbron to convert40cmin0lkonabbron long Its tail can be from convert10cmin0lkonabbron to convert15cmin0lkonabbron long Males are about one third larger than females 

The male platypus has a sharp spine on his two back legs called ankle spurs which contain a mild poison It will not kill humans but the poison has been known to kill small animals such as dogs and cause pain lasting as long as four months The amount of poison increases during the breeding season 

The platypus sleeps during the day It moves mostly at night It is a very good swimmer and spends much of its time in the water The toes on its feet are joined When it swims it pushes itself along by moving the front two feet The tail and back feet help it to turn left or right but does not make it faster

The platypus eats other animals It eats worms insect larvae which are wormlike insect babies freshwater shrimp and yabbies which are a kind of freshwater crayfish It digs these animals out of the bottom of the river with its nose or catches them while swimming Its nose can sense many things that other animal noses cannot The platypus can sense electricity from other animals It keeps its eyes shut when swimming using only its other senses such as hearing touch and changes in the electrical field No other mammal can do this The platypus can also hunt without using its eyes These are adaptations to life in rivers where the water is opaque with sediment 

When on land the platypus lives in a short straight oval holes like a rabbit burrows These holes are between convert3mft0lkonabbron and convert8mft0lkonabbron long It makes these holes in the riverbank a little above the water It likes them hidden under roots When a female platypus is pregnant the female makes much larger holes up to convert20mft0lkonabbron long She blocks the tunnel with earth at several places At the end of the tunnel she builds a nest out of reeds for her eggs 

The platypus lays eggs in its nest When the babies come out of the eggs after about ten days they hold on to the mother The mother makes milk for the new babies The platypus does not have nipples but milk comes through small openings in the skin The young platypus drinks the milk from the mothers skin while she lies on her back At six weeks the babies have fur and are able to leave the burrow for short trips After four months they no longer need their mothers milk

The long period as dependent young the provision of milk and the way the young learn through play are all advanced features and the monotremes share them with all other mammals The monotremes are a mixture of primitive and advanced traits a situation known as mosaic evolution 

The platypus lives in small streams and rivers over a large area of eastern Australia The map above shows this with dark purple It has been seen in alpine lakes in Tasmania in the south and north in Queensland as far as the Cape York Peninsula in tropical rain forest rivers 

In the past platypuses lived in South Australia but they no longer live there There are platypus on Kangaroo Island but these were brought to the island in an attempt to save animals people thought might become extinct There are very few if any platypuses left in most the Murray Darling Basin The water there is no good because people used it to grow plants and cleared the trees from the land It is strange that the platypus does not live in some healthy rivers It does live in some less healthy coastal rivers for example the Maribyrnong River in Victoria 

Platypus are difficult to see in the wild They dislike areas with people spend most of their time underground or under water and sleep during the day At Eungella National Park in Queensland there are spots on the river with viewing areas where wild platypus can usually be seen each evening

The first platypus specimen arrived in England in 1799 They sent the skin of a dead platypus so biologists could study it At first the scientists thought the skin was a joke because they thought no animal could look so strange They thought an Asian had made it from pieces of different animals

National Geographic magazine had a story on the platypus in 1939 Many people all over the world had never heard of the platypus The story told how hard it is to raise platypus babies in zoos Even today humans have raised only few platypus David Fleay at the Healesville Sanctuary in Victoria had the first successful zoo raised platypus in 1946 He nearly did it again in 1972 at the David Fleay Wildlife Park at Burleigh Heads Queensland but it died at 50 days Healesville raised another in 1998 and again in 2000 Taronga Zoo in Sydney bred twins in 2003 and had another birth in 2006

The platypus will probably not die out completely in the near future Ecologists say that it is secure but faces future threat or common but vulnerable They say this because people can make the water unsafe for the platypus

Also platypus is the name for a music project featuring John Myung from Dream Theater Derek Sherinian former Dream Theater member Ty Tabor from Kings X and Rod Morgenstein Was also a pet in the present day TV show Phineas and Ferb on Disney channel

The capital city of Kenya is Nairobi which is the 2nd largest city in Africa Other cities include seaside Mombasa and Malindi on the Indian Ocean Nyeri Nanyuki Naivasha and Thika in the Kenyan Highlands and Kisumu on Lake Victoria

The first humans may have lived near the lakes of Kenya along the Great Rift Valley which cuts Kenya from north to south

Kenyas coast is tropical and gets very hot Inland it is drier and cooler where the mountains rise up The highest mountain in Kenya is Mt Kenya at convert5199mft0 Mount Kilimanjaro crosses over the south border with Tanzania but the highest part of Kilimanjaro is in Tanzania

Many different languages are spoken in Kenya English and Kiswahili are the official languages Kiswahili is the national Language All school going Kenyans are required to learn English English is the language of instruction in the schools and institutions of higher learning

Kenya was a British colony but became independent on December 12 1963 For many years a single party the Kenya African National Union ruled Kenya Kenya has been a democratic country but from 1968 to 1992 it was a single party democracy General elections were held every 5 years However all candidates for election to office had to belong to the ruling party KANU Mwai Kibaki is currently the president of Kenya and is the first President of Kenya to belong to a party other than KANU Since he became President he has achieved a lot and Kenya has seen economic growth spurts of up 6 He however has come under heavy criticism as some feel the reforms that were needed are slow to come Many Kenyans living in Diaspora have begun to return to Kenya as the promise of the future has created plenty of high paying jobs that are appealing to foreign educated Kenyans

All Kenyans of school going age are required to attend Primary School which is provided free by the government The Kenyan school system consists of 8 years of primary school standard 1 through 8 4 years of high school and 4 years of university At the end of primary school all students sit for a standardized exam called Kenya Certificate of Primary Education The grades attained in this exam determine which high school the student will attend In Form 4 students sit for another exam called Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education The highest achieving students are granted admission into the 5 national universities Tertiary colleges like Globovillee college also feed the diploma graduates to universities

Kenya is a country of grassland but it is not rich productive land This is a very dry grassland with poor soil Kenya also has very few mineral resources Three fourths of the country is covered with plains They are low in altitude along the coast but get higher further inland making a large plateau The part east of Lake Turkana is the only true desert but the rest can be very close to desert

Savannas usually get between 4 and 16 inches of rain in a year These lands however are called savanna because of the type of plants that live there and how they get their rain Savannas have a wet and dry season During the wet season it can rain hard for long periods of time then not rain at all in the dry season Savannas that have more rain often have many trees spaced out across their plains These trees have deep roots or store water like desert plants do to live through the long dry seasons without rain Even drier savannas will have only grass and that too only in a few clumps The dry land is very bad for crops but it is a wonderful place for all kinds of wild animals to gather and stay That is why Kenya has a lot of parks where the animals are kept and protected from all the hunters Peopletourists come from all over the world to go on photo safaris in Kenyas special wildlife parks The people come to Kenya on safari to see animals such as the rhinoceros giraffe wildebeest elephant cheetah antelope and lion These animals live on the savanna grasslands

The wild herbivores move as they eat and they never stay in one spot because there is not enough grass for all of them People also usually raise cattle on the savanna These animals are kept in one place and often eat up all the grass there

Since the independence of Kenya in 1963 Kenya has usually had a one party government and has been a member of the British Commonwealth The people are like the Congo divided into many tribes that often fight However Kenyas government is trying to get the people to work together and has encouraged them to run businesses and factories Kenya is a developing country slowly growing more modern

In the late 1990s there were referendums in which the people of Scotland and Wales were asked if they wanted parliaments that were separate from the parliament of the United Kingdom This was called a devolution policy As a result the new Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly of Wales were set up The Queen opened the first sessions of these two bodies 

Recently some people in Australia want a republic with an elected or appointed President as Head of State instead of the Queen In 1999 the people of Australia were asked in a referendum whether they wanted a republic The decision of the people was to remain a monarchy The Queen visited Australia the following year and said that she would continue to serve Australians as she had done for 48 years 

Elizabeth II is friends with many world leaders Her first Prime Minister of Australia Sir Robert Menzies called her My Dear and recited a poem that said I will love her till I die She has friendships with Mary Robinson President of Ireland and George W Bush who was the first American President in more than 80 years to stay at Buckingham Palace Nelson Mandela in the BBC documentary called her my friend Elizabeth

The Queen has shown a very strong sense of duty ever since she was a girl Her promise to serve her people all her life has always been very important to her Some people think that now that she is old perhaps she will retire and let her son Prince Charles take over People who know her well including Prince Charles have said that this will never happen

The Queen has often shown courage ever since she joined the military at 18 During a trip to Ghana in 1961 she was warned that it was dangerous to be near the President Kwame Nkrumah because people wanted to kill him But she refused to stay away The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Harold Macmillan wrote that the Queen got very impatient with people if they tried to treat her like a film star 

In 1964 when the Queen was invited to Quebec there were fears for her safety because there was opposition to her visit There were suggestions that the tour should be cancelled But the Queens secretary said that the Queen would not want to be stopped from going to Quebec because of any danger During the Trooping the Colour in 1981 she was shot at but she carried on It was later discovered that the shots were blanks In 1982 a man called Michael Fagan broke into Buckingham Palace in the morning and found the Queens bedroom He woke her up and sat on her bed until the guards came to take him away

Throughout her long reign Queen Elizabeth II has been supported in her duties by her husband Prince Philip Duke of Edinburgh Prince Philip promised to help the Queen on the day of her Coronation The Queen was also helped by her mother Queen Elizabeth known as The Queen Mother who lived to be 101 years old and stayed very active in her old age The Queen is the patron of many organisations and charities She has many invitations and official duties Many of the duties have been shared by other members of the Royal Family who have also become patrons of many organisations

As the Queen is old people worry about her health but she is rarely sick However she is leaving more duties to the younger members of the Royal Family particularly to Prince Charles who will become monarch on her death

It is very hard to estimate the Queens wealth because it is private but she owns large properties such as Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle She does not own Buckingham Palace Windsor Castle or the royal collection of art which are worth millions of pounds They are owned by the government of the United Kingdom 

In 2006 Forbes magazine estimated her personal fortune at about US500 million

In military terms the word firearm is used for the type of weapons that soldiers carry pistols and rifles The word gun is used for larger guns that fire at higher speed The weapons on warships and tanks are called guns or turrets not firearms 

Guns are very effective weapons Guns fire bullets at a very high speed which is much more deadly than an arrow or spear 

Bullets are basically non explosive bits of metal as opposed to shells which explode upon impact A modern bullet is the front part of a round or cartridge A cartridge consists of a bullet a casing propellant and a primer When the rear end is struct by the hammer an explosion in the back of the cartridge shoots the bullet 

Cartridges have different ways of being loaded into different kinds of weapons Cartridges can be loaded directly into a firearm or into a clip a magazine or other bullet container which is loaded into the firearm Some firearms have their rounds loaded into the stock of the weapon A clip is loaded with rounds and the clip is loaded into a weapon The magazine is a container for the rounds which has a spring that moves the bullets into place for firing Firearms known as revolvers have a cylinder with holes that the bullets are loaded into Modern guns are usually loaded with a magazine and are called automatic loading

Firearms are designed to shoot bullets at people or animals causing damage to them Most firearms are designed to shoot at people Some kinds of firearms such as hunting rifles are designed to shoot at other animals A deer hunter usually shoots a deer with a rifle Some people also use firearms for shooting sports usually known as target shooting Target Shooting is an Olympic sport

Guns are the main weapons used by armies In modern armies every soldier has a firearm as part of his or her equipment which they are taught to use and keep in good working order Guns have been used by armies since about 900 AD when the Chinese began using cannons Long barreled guns called muskets that could be carried and used by one person were used in China by the 1300s Guns were not an important weapon in European armies until the 1600s 

Because guns make it very easy to kill many countries only allow soldiers policemen to have them In many countries a person must have a special permit if they want to own a gun Depending on the gun people need to be a certain age and may need to meet other criteria to get such a permit An example of this is that in the United States you can get some types of guns when you are 18 In United States and other countries people can buy some guns and use them for self defense sport such as hunting target shooting and target practice In some countries such as Australia people who live on farms are allowed to keep guns but it is not easy for a person living in the city to get a gun without good reason

The Hungarians established Hungary in 896 after they had arrived there from their previous Eastern European territories Prince rpd was their leader at the time he also established the first royal house of the country the rpd house In 1000 after the first king Saint Stephen had been crowned the country became a Kingdom 

In 1241 the Tatars invaded the country causing many deaths and damages In 1301 the rpd house died out Later on kings from various houses were ruling over Hungary The greatest of them is Matthias Corvinus famous for protecting the country against the Ottoman aggression However some decades after he had died the Ottomans defeated the country in the Battle of Mohcs The Kingdom was cut up to three parts the western and northern areas remained Hungary the southern region fell under Ottoman rule and the eastern parts became semi independent as the Principality of Transylvania

The Kingdom of Hungary became a Habsburg dependency because an agreement made in Vienna in 1515 said that the Habsburg family would take over the territory of the Jagellion family in Bohemia and Hungary if the line of kings should die out In 1686 the Ottomans were forced to leave and the country was reunified There were many nationalities living in the country at this time except Hungarians there were also present the ancestors of modern Slovaks Serbs and Romanians

Hungary lost the war According to the Treaty of Trianon Hungary lost two thirds of its territory On the majority of these territories non Hungarians were living however many Hungarians also found themselves outside their country in the nation state of Romanians or Slovakians Thus the main political goal of the governments under Horthy was to revise this treaty and at least to regain the Hungarian inhabited lands

A very long time ago Illyrian and Celtics tribes lived in Slovenia In the first century BC Slovenia was ruled by the Romans In the sixth century AD Slavs lived there Slovenia was ruled by Austria from 1335 until 1918 In 1918 it became a part of Yugoslavia During World War II Italy Hungary and Germany took parts of the country but in 1945 it became part of Yugoslavia again

In June 1991 following a 10 day war Slovenia became an independent country

Kimonos are traditional Japanese style clothes Kimono meant something you wear originally Long ago people in Japan wore kimonos every day Now people only wear a kimono for special occasions such as formal ceremonies 

A kimono is a robe shaped like a T Normal kimonos reaches to the ankles and have very long sleeves Kimonos for women usually have a colorful design of flowers butterflies etc People wear a wide belt called an obi with their kimono Obi are also colorful

Womens kimonos are all the same size They fold them and tuck them to make them the right size People who are very tall or heavy have to have kimonos made for them 

There are different types of formal and casual kimono Kimonos are usually made of silk but there are cotton and polyester kimonos as well

Kimonos are very expensive One womans kimono can cost more than US10000 The obi are very expensive too They can cost thousands of dollars Most peoples kimonos are not so expensive Some people make their own kimono or buy them second hand 

Japanese people have been wearing kimonos for hundreds of years Today kimonos are worn only at special times More women wear kimonos than men Men wear kimonos most often at weddings and Japanese tea ceremonies Mens kimonos are made of haori and hakama

People who play some sports like kendo also wear kimono They are tough thick and short not like typical womens kimono They are usually called do gi

In Japan people can take classes about wearing kimonos and learn about how to choose kimonos and how to tie the obi

Most Japanese women do not know how to put on a kimono by themselves because it is very difficult Some people work as kimono dressers They help people to put on their kimono 

Some people still wear kimonos every day in Japan

A sconce is a holder for candles or electric lights that is fixed on a wall Most of the time sconces are also meant to make the place look more beautiful

Culture is a word for peoples way of life meaning the way they do things Different groups of people may have different cultures A culture is passed on to the next generation by learning whereas genetics are passed on by heredity Culture is seen in peoples writing religion music clothes cooking and in what they do 

The concept of culture is very complicated and the word has many meanings The word culture is most commonly used in three senses

Now culture includes all human phenomena which are not purely results of human genetics The discipline which investigates cultures is called anthropology though many other disciplines play a part

Cultures are what make countries unique Each country has different cultural activities and cultural rituals Culture is more than just material goods that is things the culture uses and produces Culture is also the beliefs and values of the people in that culture Culture also includes the way people think about and understand the world and their own lives

Different countries have different cultures For example some older Japanese people wear kimonos arrange flowers in vases and have tea ceremonies

Culture can also vary within a region society or sub group A workplace may have a specific culture that sets it apart from similar workplaces A region of a country may have a different culture than the rest of the country For example Canadas east coast Maritime region has a different culture than the rest of Canada which is expressed by different ways of talking different types of music and different types of dances 

A family may have a specific set of values because of this people every time follow their religion to have or find new culture

Companies or other organizations can have a separate culture Japanese manufacturing companies often have a different culture than other companies the workday starts with exercise and the workers are very loyal to the company 

Companies in the high technology sector often have a different culture than other companies Software and computer companies sometimes allow employees to play games during the workday or take time off work to relax because these companies believe that this will help the workers to think better

Anthropology is studying human beings and how they relate to each other An anthropologist is a person who studies anthropology Anthropologists believe that people use symbols to communicate their experienceswho they are what they believe where they started 

Anthropologists call this use of symbols culture For example immigrants may keep some of their customs and traditions from their old country By keeping their culture in this way they express who they are and that they came from somewhere else

A houseplant is any kind of decorative plant People grow them indoors usually in a house where these plants gets their name

Waxed paper is a type of paper which has been coated on both sides with wax This gives it a translucent look It is used for wrapping food because grease oil and water cannot pass through it It is also used to line food containers because many kinds of food which would stick to normal paper will not stick to wax paper Many kinds of dry foods were once stored in wax paper because of its resistance to water Wax paper has been replaced by plastic wrap for most purposes

The Japanese tea ceremony is a special way of making green tea 

People who study the tea ceremony have to learn about different kinds of tea They also have to learn about kimono flowers and many other things It takes many years of practice to learn the tea ceremony 

Tea came to Japan from China in about 900 CE Tea became very popular in Japan and Japanese people started to grow tea in Japan 

In the 12th century matcha became popular This tea comes from the same plant as black tea 

By the 16th century all people in Japan rich people and poor people liked drinking tea A man called Sen no Rikyu started teaching about tea ceremony Many years have passed but people still make tea the same way that Sen no Rikyu taught

People need many different things for a tea ceremony

People do the tea ceremony in a special tea room or a special building called a cha shitsu Most people wear kimonos

When people go into the tea room they take off their shoes and sit on special floor mat called tatami

Cha shitsu often are very small The guests sometimes eat food and drink special Japanese wine called sake Before they drink the matcha they eat something sweet 

The host symbolically purifies the tea bowl and the other tea things Then he or she puts some green tea powder into the tea bowl The host mixes the tea with hot water He mixes it with a whisk The guests drink tea from the bowl

When everyone has finished drinking tea the host cleans everything and puts them away Then the guests leave

A tea ceremony can take from about twenty minutes to about four hours

A sideboard is a piece of furniture It is often placed in a dining room with a long table and cupboard below to hold dishes glasses and other things

Movies also known as films are a type of visual communication which use moving pictures and sound to tell stories or inform People in every part of the world watch movies as a type of entertainment a way to have fun Fun for some people can mean laughing while for others it can mean crying or feeling afraid Most movies are made so that they can be shown on big screens at cinemas or movie theatres After movies are shown on cinema screens for a period of time movies are shown on pay television or cable television and sold or rented on DVD disks or videocassette tapes so that people can watch the movies at home Later movies are shown on television stations 

A movie camera or video camera takes pictures very quickly usually at 25 pictures every second When a movie projector a computer or a television shows the pictures at that rate it looks like the things shown in the set of pictures are really moving Sound is either recorded at the same time or added later The sounds in a movie usually include the sounds of people talking music and Foley the sounds of activities that are happening in the movie

A screenwriter writes a script which is the story of the movie with the words that the actors will say Then a producer hires people to work on the movie and gets all of the money that will be needed to pay for the actors and the equipment Producers usually get the money by borrowing it from a bank or by getting investors to lend money to the movie production Some producers work for a movie studio other producers are independent

Actors and directors read scripts to find out what to say and what to do The actors memorize the words from the script that they will say in the movie and learn the actions that the script tells them to do Then the director tells the actors what to do and a cameraman takes motion pictures of them with a motion picture camera 

When filming has finished an editor puts the moving pictures together in a way that tells the whole story within a set amount of time Audio engineers and sound engineers record music and singing and join it with the moving pictures When the movie is done many copies of the movie are made by movie labs and put onto movie reels Then the movie reels are sent to cinemas An electric machine called a projector shines a very bright light through the movie and people sitting in a dark room see it on a big screen of Classic Movies 1920 1982

A genre is a word for a type of movie or a style of movie Movies can be fictional or true or a mix of the two Although hundreds of movies are made every year there are very few that do not follow a small number of set plots or stories Some movies mix together two or more genres

Dramas are serious and often about people falling in love or people who have to make a big decision in their life They tell stories about relationships between people They usually follow a basic plot where one or two main characters have to overcome an obstacle to get what they want Tragedies are always dramas For example a husband and wife who are divorcing must each try to prove to a court of law that they are the best person to take care of their child Emotion are a big part of the movie and the audience may get upset and even cry

Action movies have a lot of exciting effects like car chases and gun fights involving stuntmen They usually involve goodies and baddies so war and crime are common subjects Action films usually need very little effort to watch since the plot is normally simple For example terrorists take control of a skyscraper and ask for a lot of money in exchange for not killing the people who work there One man somehow manages to save everyone and is the hero Action movies do not usually make people cry but if the action movie is also a drama emotion will be involved

Thrillers are usually about a mystery strange event or crime that needs to be solved The audience is kept guessing until the final minutes when there are usually twists in the plot

Comedies are funny movies about people being silly or doing unusual things that make the audience laugh 

Romantic Comedies are usually love stories about 2 people from different worlds who must overcome obstacles to be together Rom Coms are always light hearted but may include some emotion

Buddy movies involve 2 heroes one must save the other both must overcome obstacles Buddy movies often involve comedy but there is also some emotion because of the close friendship between the buddies 

Science fiction movies are set in the future or in outer space Some use their future or alien settings to ask questions about the meaning of life or how we should think about life Science fiction movies often use special effects to create images of alien worlds outer space alien creatures and spaceships

Western movies tell stories about cowboys living in the western United States in the 1800s They are usually really Action movies but with historical costume They may or may not involve Indians

Horror films use fear to excite the audience Music lighting and sets are all designed to add to the feeling

Animated movies use childish images like talking pigs to tell a story These films used to be drawn by hand one frame at a time but are now made on computers

Documentaries are movies that are about real people and real events They are nearly always serious and may involve strongly emotional subjects for example cruelty

Film noir movies are 1940s era detective movies about crime and violence

Movies can make profits in the hundreds of millions be they dollars euro or pounds In India movies have become an enormous part of the economy The industry has always been dominated by quite a small number of major studios like MGM Warner Columbia or Paramount There are many large companies that provide all of the services needed to make movies such as special effects lighting set building Many of these employees belong to unions who say how much their members must be paid A huge number of smaller companies also offer services such as music studios and CGI computer generated imagery Finally there are movie distribution companies and advertising companies who let people know about the film and promote it

Movies with famous stars and large budgets are designed to have a wide appeal so that hopefully millions of people will pay to see them Movies like this which always cost the most to make are called blockbusters Special effects can add a huge amount to the cost of a film especially the newest CGI effects but people have come to expect them and every blockbuster film tries to out do the last Today in 2008 some films can cost up to 200 million to make But when you stop to think that very successful films can make many times that amount in profit it is easy to see why the studios keep producing them This kind of movie will have a lot of promotion through television advertising billboards and internet sites In blockbuster movies there is usually a happy ending in which all of the problems in the plot are figured out or fixed and almost everyone live happily ever after Some films have been so successful that the studios keep releasing more and more films with the same characters and basic plots 

At the opposite end of the scale to the blockbuster there is the independent art or Indie movie These are usually made by small movie companies or even just a small group of people that do not have much money An example is The Blair Witch Project which cost only about 60000 but which has so far taken perhaps 200 million in ticket and DVD sales Films like this are very unusual and usually become popular underground so that they become cult or popular but not mainstream Independent movies often tell more creative or unusual stories or may have sad endings that do not appeal to the big studios because they can not be sure how the public will react to them They rarely make a lot of money but if they are successful the big studios will quickly try to get the people involved to sign a contract with them by offering them a lot of money to make another film It is often the case that the new film with its big budget and its stars will be less successful than the first

Holland is the name of a region in the western part of the Netherlands Holland was a county of the Holy Roman Empire and later the leading province of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands

Today there are two provinces called Holland in the Netherlands North Holland and South Holland Those provinces were created in 1840 The earlier country and province of Holland used to be greater but some Hollandic parts were given to other provinces during the French occupation Willemstad became part of North Brabant the islands of Vlieland and Terschelling were given to Friesland and the island of Urk to Overijssel

Many people use the name Holland to refer to the entire Netherlands but that is not correct It is like calling the United Kingdom England the United States America or like calling the EU a country Some Dutch people who do not live in Holland do not like it when people call the entire country Holland

For a short time there was a Kingdom of Holland which was in central and northern Netherlands and East Friesland in Germany

  

Holland is also the name of a region in England

The atoms of a chemical element can exist in different types These are called isotopes They have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons Different isotopes of the same element have different masses Mass is the word for how much substance something has Things with different masses have different weights Because different isotopes have different numbers of neutrons they do not all weigh the same or have the same mass

Different isotopes of the same element have the same atomic number They have the same number of protons The atomic number is decided by the number of protons Isotopes have different mass numbers though because they have different numbers of neutrons

The word isotope meaning at the same place comes from the fact that isotopes are located at the same place on the periodic table

In a neutral atom the number of electrons equals the number of protons Isotopes of the same element also have the same number of electrons and the electronic structure Because how an atom acts is decided by its electronic structure isotopes are almost the same chemically but different physically to their original atoms

Heavier isotopes react slower than lighter isotopes of the same element This mass effect is large for protium and deuterium because deuterium has twice the mass of protium For heavier elements the relative mass difference between isotopes is much less and the mass effect is usually small

Atomic nuclei are protons and neutrons held together by the strong nuclear force Because protons have a positive charge they push against other protons Neutrons are electrically neutral and they attract the protons more than the protons push against other protons This makes the nucleus more stable So we need neutrons for more than two protons to be in a nucleus As there are more protons more neutrons are needed to have a stable nucleus But if there are too many neutrons the nucleus becomes unstable

In Nature some elements have just a single isotopes For example fluorine 19F is the only isotope of fluorine Other elements have many isotopes For example xenon has 9 isotopes 

Also some isotopes are radioactive These are called radioactive isotopes Others are not radioactive These are called stable isotopes

Hydrogen has three common isotopes The most common isotope of hydrogen is called protium A hydrogen atom with an extra neutron is called deuterium Hydrogen with one proton and two neutrons is called tritium Protium and deuterium are stable isotopes while tritium is a radioactive isotope

The heaviest elements in the periodic table are all radioactive All of the isotopes of radon thorium and uranium are radioactive since they are very heavy This is because the nuclear forces inside the nucleus of the atom have a tough time holding together all the particles with so many protons and neutrons inside

In the past many rulers in south and southeast Asia had people crushed by elephants This was common for more than 4000 years The Romans and Carthaginians also sometimes did this

For hundreds of years people used elephants for military purposes Death under the foot of an elephant was common for people who left the army or prisoners as well as for military criminals

The elephant would step upon the head of the condemned the one commanded to die Usually handlers trained the elephant to put its large foot gently on the persons head At this point witnesses looked under the elephants foot to make sure the prisoner was the one who committed the crime Often the condemned would scream and beg the witnesses to say it was not him If a witness stated this was not the criminal they would probably commit perjury Perjury means lying at a trial In those days rulers could punish perjury with death Few witnesses denied the condemned was the criminal because then the elephant may crush them instead Then the mahout or elephant driver gave the order and the elephant would push down with its weight The skull broke and the foot crushed the head flat

Sometimes the elephant would drag the condemned through streets before the crushing Some elephants crushed the arms and legs first to increase the pain

Most rajahs Indian rulers kept elephants for death by crushing The public could often see the deaths this was the rulers warning not to commit a crime Many of the elephants were very large weighing more than nine tons Rulers wanted crushing by elephant to be bloody and gross Some rulers in history condemned children too 

Many rulers in South Asia used elephants as executioners ones who put the condemned to death One nonreligious Mogul Emperor Akbar used his favorite elephant as a judge too Akbar ruled in the city of Agra from 1570 1585 He believed that his favorite elephant could know who was guilty He put thousands of people to death this way Even when the crimes were minor he sent them to the elephant Elephant handlers staked them before the great elephant and tried to convince it to step on them The huge elephant crushed most but sometimes refused Akbar believed this proved their innocence and then released them 

There are few records about crushing by elephant Many records were lost The British wrote many things about it during their long rule of India The British used crushing by elephant even into the 20th century They used it to terrify and because the Indians had used it before them When the British took over a state they liked to use local ways of doing things

Different regions crushed people by elephant in different ways One region put people inside of a bag so they would not have to watch what was about to happen Then the elephant would crush the bag flat with the condemned inside In another region people made the condemned watch the elephant slowly come from far away Its huge feet kept coming closer Sometimes they buried the condemned to the neck The elephant would come and step on the head Some places made the condemned put his head on a special stand The stand had fountains on the sides where brains and blood would flow when the elephant pressed down its huge foot

Robert Knox was an English traveler He wrote about a Sri Lankan crushing in 1681

The last time an elephant executed someone was in Bikaner India in April 1947 The executioner was a state elephant named Hawai that weighed over eight tons Under British rule it put over 150 thieves and murderers to death with its huge foot

A Power network is a type of contact network where its members can tell other people what to do

It must be large enough to literally scare or force people to go along with its requests which makes them orders or commands This typically requires thousands of people in constant touch with each other

A political party is the most obvious example It is typically much larger than a social network but is not one since people can only call on each other for a small number of reasons and perhaps at specific times Also not every member of the network has the same role or right to help

A corporation may also be a power network if it relies on many power relations to maintain itself  for instance the right to draw oil from the ground or dump waste without being held responsible for it

When a power network achieves some stable grasp of political power and daily working control of some critical infrastructural capital it becomes a power structure In a democracy the visible power networks represented by the parties compete regularly in an election  but much of the power structure typically the bureaucracy does not change and is typically ignored as a power network in itself

Citizenship is the relationship between a person and his or her country usually the same one he or she lives in supports and in return gets protection from A person is usually a citizen of the country where he or she is born but sometimes a person will apply to change his or her citizenship to become a citizen in another country

In most countries citizens have rights such as political participation at a lawful age and duties such as keeping the laws 

Some have made a difference between a citizen living in a republic and a subject who is under the rule of a king or queen

Elephants are the largest living land mammals The largest elephant recorded was one shot in Angola 1974 It weighed 27060 pounds and stood 13 feet 8 inches tall 

At birth an elephant calf may weigh 100 kg The baby elephant develops for 20 to 22 months inside its mother No other land animal takes this long to develop before being born

There are two living genera of elephants These are African Loxodonta africanus and Asian elephants Elephas maximus

An elephants most obvious part is the trunk The trunk is a very long nose made from the upper lip An elephant uses its trunk to grab objects such as food Though the rest of an elephants hide is strong and thick its trunk is very soft and sensitive Elephants avoid Acacia trees with symbiotic ants because they can bite the inside of an elephants trunk

Elephants also have tusks Tusks are large teeth coming out of their upper jaws A lot of ivory comes from elephant tusks Ivory traders killed many elephants so now hunting them is illegal The trunk is also used when it trumpets The elephant usually stands still raise its trunk and blow This is a signal to other elephants and wildlife

African elephants are larger and have bigger ears They are browsergrazers they eat leaves branches and grass These big ears have many veins which carry blood throughout the body Biologists think that the blood going through their ears helps African elephants to cool off The weather is hotter in Africa than in Asia so it is hard for elephants to stay cool Female African elephants have tusks but female Asian elephants do not African elephants have a low place in their back African elephants have two fingers at the end of their trunks but Asian elephants only have one Indian elephants eat mainly grass 

Grass wears down their teeth Elephants use their teeth in sequence not all at once This means that at any time they only have one tooth in each jaw thats a total of four

In total they have 24 teeth 12 front teeth called premolars and 12 back teeth called molars When the last molar wears out the elephant dies because it cannot eat They can live for about 70 years But in a zoo or circus people can keep elephants alive by feeding them soft food 

Some African elephants live on the savanna while others live in the forest Today many people think these are different species Scientists named the forest group Loxodonta cyclotis and the savanna group Loxodonta africanus

Humans have used elephants for different things The Carthaginian general Hannibal took some elephants across the Alps when he fought the Romans He probably used the North African elephant a kind of elephant that does not live today It was smaller than other African elephants

People have used Indian elephants to move around and to have fun Many circuses have them Siamese Indians and other South Asians used them for several things They fought in armies and they crushed criminals They also did heavy work like lifting trees and moving logs 

However people have never domesticated elephants Domesticated animals are tame and have babies under human control The male elephant in heat is dangerous and hard to control Most elephants used by people are female except those used in war In a battle female elephants run from males so armies needed males

In the wild elephants have strong family groups Their ways of acting toward other elephants are hard for people to understand They talk to each other with very low sounds Most elephants sounds are so low people cannot hear them But elephants can hear these sounds far away

The earliest known ancestors of modern day elephants evolved about 60 million years ago The ancestor of the elephants from 37 million years ago was aquatic and had a similar lifestyle to a hippopotamus Elephants are related to sea cows which are large aquatic mammals 

The extinct animals called mammoths were relatives of todays elephants Modern elephants live only in warm places but the woolly mammoth had long hair and lived in cold places during the ice age

Both African and Asian elephants are endangered species

A female elephant will have a single baby usually weighing about 90 kilograms when it is born every four or five years An elephants gestation lasts about 22 months Another female elephant often stays with the new mother until its baby is born The newborn elephant can often stand within a half hour after it is born Mother elephants touch their babies gently with their trunks It takes a baby a year or more to control its trunk and learn its many uses

Baby elephants nurse for the first two years of their lives After it is born the first thing that the baby does is wobble in search of its mothers milk It drinks about 10 liters of milk every day

White elephants are considered holy in Thailand

The most famous fictional elephant is Dumbo It is a flying elephant in a Disney movie The Elephants Child is one of Rudyard Kiplings Just So Stories

Ganesha is the god of wisdom in Hinduism He has an elephants head

The elephant is the symbol for the United States Republican Party It is like the Democratic Partys donkey The first person to use the elephant as a symbol for the Republican Party was Thomas Nast He did that in a Harpers Weekly cartoon in 1874

Buddhism teaches people how to reduce their suffering by understanding themselves better Often people do bad things and they get evil responses Buddha discovered a way to end this and taught it Some see it as a religion other people think it is a philosophy and for others Buddhism is a way of finding reality The teachings of Gautama Buddha a man who lived between about 563 and 483 BC tell us how to live a good life The Buddha was a rich prince He gave up everything to work out how best to live His teachings started in India and slowly spread after his death through most of Asia to Central Asia Tibet Sri Lanka Southeast Asia and the East Asian countries of China Mongolia Korea and Japan and have now spread to the west

The Buddhas teachings are about suffering and how to overcome it According to Buddha overcoming suffering allows a person to be truly happy Buddha taught that if people make good decisions they would be happy and have peace of mind Buddha taught that life is imperfect and that we will suffer He taught that we suffer because of desire anger and stupidity and he showed that we could end our suffering by letting go of desires and overcoming anger and stupidity The complete letting go of these negative influences is called Nirvana meaning to extinguish like putting out the flame of a candle The end of suffering when one is fully awake and has let go of all desire and anger is also called Enlightenment In Buddhism Enlightenment and Nirvana mean the same thing

Buddhism teaches non harm and moderation or balance not going too far one way or the other Buddhists often meditate or think deeply while sitting in a special or specific way They often chant and meditate while walking Buddhists sometimes do these things to understand the human heart and mind Sometimes they do these things to understand the way the world works Sometimes they do these things to find peace

Buddhism does not say if gods exist or not but one can read many stories about gods in some Buddhist books Buddhists do not believe that people should look to gods to save them or bring them enlightenment The gods may have power over world events and they might help people or they might not But its up to each person to get to enlightenment Many Buddhists honor gods in ritual Other Buddhists believe the stories about gods are just there to help us learn about parts of ourselves

Buddha is a word in the very old Indian languages Pli and Sanskrit which means Enlightened one The word Buddha often means the historical Buddha named Buddha Shakyamuni but Buddha does not mean just one man who lived at a certain time It is used for a type of person the equivalent of a prophet and Buddhists believe there have been many  that there were Buddhas a very long time ago and there will be for a long time in the future

Buddhists do not believe that a Buddha is a god but that he is a human being who has woken up and can see the true way the world works They believe this knowledge totally changes the person Some say this puts them beyond birth death and rebirth Others think this represents the final extinction of desire This person can help others become enlightened too

According to Buddhism there were countless Buddhas before Gautama Buddha and there will be many Buddhas after him In short he is not the first nor will he be the last

However counting from the present kalpa Buddha Gautama is considered the fourth Buddha The first is Kakusandho Buddha second Konakamano Buddha and the third Kassapo Buddha The last Buddha of this kalpa will be Mettaya Buddha Then the universe will renew itself and from then begins a new kalpa

Old stories say that Siddhrtha Gautama was born around the 6th century BC He was the one who would become the first Buddha in written history Some Buddhists believe that Siddhrtha Gautama was a perfect person

He was born a prince and was unsure about if he wanted to become a religious man or a prince At age 29 he noticed pain and suffering He then wanted to learn the answer to the problem of human suffering or pain He gave up all his money and power and became a monk without a home He walked from place to place trying to learn the answers to life 

At last he found enlightenment while sitting under a big tree called the Bodhi Tree He was the first person to teach Buddhism to the people and Buddhists love him for that 

After Siddhrtha Gautama died his students taught the Buddhas teaching to more people After a long time they wrote down the things that he may have said

The Buddha told people to follow a special way of life called the Noble Eightfold Path if they want to understand the Four Noble Truths These are

Buddhists are encouraged to follow five precepts or rules that say what not to do The Buddha taught that killing stealing having sex in a harmful way and lying are not signs of skill

These are the Five concepts

A story can be different things 

Governor General is a representative of a head of state The term is mostly used in Commonwealth countries where the governor general is a representative of the monarch

Sometimes the title is spelled as Governor General which is used in Canada but sometimes it is spelled with a hyphen  Governor General which is the spelling used in Australia

According to the general theory of relativity a black hole is a region of space from which nothing including light can escape It is the result of the denting of spacetime caused by a very compact mass Around a black hole there is an undetectable surface which marks the point of no return called an event horizon It is called black because it absorbs all the light that hits it reflecting nothing just like a perfect black body in thermodynamics Under the theory of quantum mechanics black holes possess a temperature and emit Hawking radiation through slow dissipation by anti protons

Despite its undetectable interior a black hole can be observed through its interaction with matter A black hole can be inferred by tracking the movement of a group of stars that orbit a region in space Alternatively when gas falls into a stellar black hole from a companion star or nebula the gas spirals inward heating to very high temperatures and emitting large amounts of radiation that can be detected from earthbound and Earth orbiting telescopes

Astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates and have also found evidence of supermassive black holes at the center of every galaxy After observing the motion of nearby stars for 16 years in 2008 astronomers found compelling evidence that a supermassive black hole of more than 4 million solar masses is located near the Sagittarius A region in the center of the Milky Way galaxy

In 1783 an English geologist named John Mitchell wrote that it might be possible for something to be so big and heavy that the escape speed from its gravity is equal to the speed of light Gravity gets stronger as something gets bigger or more massive For a small thing like a rocket to escape from a larger thing like Earth it has to go escape the pull of our gravity or it will fall back The speed that it must travel upward to get away from Earths gravity is called escape velocity Bigger planets and stars have more mass so have stronger gravity than Earth so the escape velocity is much faster John Mitchell thought it was possible for something to be so big that the escape velocity would be faster than the speed of light so even light could not escape

Some scientists thought Mitchell might be right but others thought that light had no mass and would not be pulled by gravity His theory was forgotten

In 1916 Albert Einstein wrote an explanation of gravity called general relativity It is a very complicated theory but there are two important things about it

A few months later a German physicist named Karl Schwarzschild calculated that a black hole could exist

In 1930 Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar predicted that stars heavier than the sun could collapse when they ran out of hydrogen or other nuclear fuels to burn and died In 1939 Robert Oppenheimer and H Snyder calculated that a star would have to be at least three times as massive as the sun to form a black hole

In 1967 John Wheeler gave black holes the name black hole for the first time Before that they were called dark stars

In 1970 Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose proved that black holes must exist Although the black holes are invisible some of the matter that is falling into them is very bright

Most black holes are made when a giant star called a supergiant at least twenty times bigger than our own Sun dies and leaves behind a mass that is at least one solar mass Stars die when they run out of hydrogen or other nuclear fuel to burn and iron is produced Iron does not give off energy and therefore the star has no fuel and in a short amount of time the star collapses 

A supergiant stars death is called a supernova Stars are usually in equilibrium which means they are making enough energy to push their mass outward against the force of gravity When the star runs out of fuel to make energy gravity takes over Gravity pulls the center of the star inward very quickly and it collapses into a little ball The collapse is so fast and violent that it makes a shock wave and that causes the rest of the star to explode outward As the gravity pushes the star inward the pressure in the center of star reaches to such an extreme level that it enables heavier molecules like iron and carbon to interact to release nuclear energy The release of the energy from the star during a very short period of time is with such a high rate that it outshines an entire galaxy 

The ball in the center is so dense that if you could somehow scoop only one teaspoon of material and bring it to Earth it would sink to the core of the planet If the original star was large enough the densely packed ball is called a singularity the core of a black hole but if it was not it would become either a neutron star or a dwarf star

Even without a supernova a black hole will form any time there is a lot of matter in a small space without enough energy to act against gravity and stop it from collapsing

If supernovas are so bright why do we not see them often Actually there are usually hundreds of years between naked eye super nova sightings It is because the period of being a super nova in a star life cycle is only a few hours out of the billions of years in a stars life span The probability of looking at a star in sky and that being in super nova state is equal to the ratio of an hour over several billion years

It is worth mentioning that all of the heavier materials like carbon oxygen all the metals etc that make the life on the earth possible and are ingredients of all living creatures can only form in the extreme pressure at the center of a super nova So we are all a remnant ash from one exploding star several billion years ago

Black holes have also been found in the middle of every major galaxy in the universe These are called supermassive black holes and are the biggest black holes of all They formed when the Universe was very young and also helped to form all the galaxies

Some black holes are also responsible for making things called quasars A quasar occurs when a black hole consumes all the gas surrounding it As the gas gets close to the black hole itself it heats up from a process called friction and glows so brightly that this light can be seen on the other side of the Universe It is often brighter than the whole galaxy the quasar is in When astronomers first found quasars they thought they had found objects close to us After using a measuring technique called red shift they discovered these quasars were actually very far away in the universe

At the middle of a black hole there is a really small thing called a singularity but it is impossible to see it because light gets sucked into it and not reflected Around the tiny singularity there is a large area where light which would normally pass by gets sucked in as well The edge of this area is called the event horizon The gravity of the black hole gets weaker at a distance The event horizon is the place farthest away from the middle where the gravity is still strong enough to trap light The singularity is like the pipe under a sink while the event horizon is like the edge of the drain where water always gets sucked in

Outside the event horizon light and matter will still be pulled toward the black hole If a black hole is surrounded by matter the matter will form an accretion disk around the black hole An accretion disk looks something like the rings of Saturn As it gets sucked in the matter gets very hot and shoots x ray radiation into space Think of this as the water spinning around the hole before it falls in

Most black holes are too far away and small to see the accretion disk and jet The best way to know a black hole is there is by seeing how stars gas and other things behave around it With a black hole nearby even objects as big as a star move in a different way usually faster than they would if the black hole was not there 

Also because black holes can bend light passing by if a black hole passes between us and a source of light very far away the light will become quite distorted like a fun house mirror at a circus until the black hole moves out of the way The light can also be magnified like a magnifying glass allowing scientists to see things farther away 

We cannot actually see black holes one way of detecting them is to look at the sky when a black hole passes between us and a source of light the light bends around the black hole creating a mirror image so when astronomers see patches of sky that are identical they may have found a black hole

A lot of science fiction writers use black holes in their stories and many scientists wish to find one relatively close to Earth to study one better 

Scientists also think black holes might cause wormholes theoretical portals through space

Singularities are what scientists believe to be inside of a black hole These singularities present a huge problem to black hole theorists because they present fundamental flaws in Einsteins work This is because when you use the equations to work out what a singularity is the answer is infinite time and space which makes no scientific sense

Stephen Hawking discovered the evaporation of the black hole by quantum field theory in a static black hole background The result of his calculations is that a black hole should emit particles in a perfect black body spectrum When trying to prove the existence of black holes Hawking realized that particles and their counterparts are colliding every second everywhere popping in and out of existence If a pair of particles were to pop into existence at the edge of the event horizon one could potentially get sucked in while its counterpart floats free This process would emit a small amount of radiation This effect has become known as Hawking radiation

It was commonly thought that a black hole was there forever and if you were trapped in one you would be stuck there eternally This was proved wrong when scientists discovered small leaks in black holes This meant that over billions and billions of years a black hole would disperse The leaking is slow at first but as it gets smaller it gets faster and faster

Sheffield is a big city in a region called South Yorkshire in the North of England 534500 people live there Sheffield is in the middle of lots of hills The city centre is where the River Sheaf meets the River Don and Sheffield gets its name from the River Sheaf The city is east of the Peak District National Park It is estimated that Sheffield has over two million trees which is more than any city in Europe per each person 61 of the city is green space such as parks and forests

The area of Sheffield used to be the Anglo Saxon shire of Hallamshire the city itself was founded later

Sheffield is famous for making cutlery People in Sheffield have made cutlery for a very long time Sheffield is also famous for making steel Benjamin Huntsman discovered the crucible technique for making steel in 1740 In 1856 Henry Bessemer invented the Bessemer Converter steelmaking furnace Henry moved to Sheffield to make steel Later in 1912 Harry Brearly invented stainless steel in Sheffield

The first football team in the world is from Sheffield Sheffield FC set up in 1857 Sheffield currently has two big professional football teams Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday

There are lots of famous bands from Sheffield Some of them are Pulp the Human League Def Leppard and the Arctic Monkeys Michael Palin is also from Sheffield

A fertilizer is a chemical that helps plants to grow It is used to replace the mineral salts taken by plants or removed by rain

Common fertilizers

The important things in fertilizer are

When fertilizers are offered for sale the percentage of N P and K must be be written on the bags or boxes but for historcal reasons P is shown as P2O5 and K is shown as K2O 

Eg9 23 30 which means  9 N 23P2O5 and 30K2O

In Australia the pecent of elemental sulfur must also be shown In the UK the elemental composition may also be shown along side the mandatory traditional system provided the numbers are put inside square brackets 

Leafy plants need lots of N Flowering plants need lots of P and K

The military is the group or groups of people that are given power to defend a country against attacks The military protects its country by defending it from the armed forces of enemies if there is a war The military can also be ordered by the government of the country to attack another country The word military comes from Latin miles warrior

There are many jobs to do in a military Some jobs are for fighting and some are for other work to support the military Some things people do in the military are use weapons drive vehicles and repair weapons Other people in the military learn how to fly aircraft pilot ships or repair engines People in the military usually wear clothes called a uniform In some places especially where there may be combat a uniform often comes in a camouflage pattern which is designed to make the person hard to see in the forest or desert

There are two ways to join the military In many countries people join the military as volunteers In other countries there are laws that some people have to be in the military even if they do not want to be This is called the draft or conscription It usually depends on age and physical fitness People who have been in the military but have left or retired are called veterans 

The military of a country is usually divided into different branches organizations that do different kinds of work These branches usually are

Sometimes the military has more branches that do more specialized work For example in the United States and United Kingdom there are

Joining up and training In most countries of the world young men and women between 17 and 18 and of good health may be forced by the government of their country to join the military and have military training This is called conscription The countries that do not have conscription include Australia Bangladesh Canada France Hungary India Italy Japan Malta New Zealand Saudi Arabia Slovenia South Africa Spain United Kingdom and United States In some countries such as Argentina conscription is legal but is not used at the present time

When a person wants to join the military as a volunteer they enlist They have to be above a certain age 17 or 18 in most countries They have to pass physical fitness tests to show that they are well enough to do the jobs that they will have to do They must also have good enough hearing to hear instructions and good enough sight to use a rifle 

New people in the military are often called recruits They have training at a special camp sometimes called boot camp During this training the recruits usually have very little free time They learn to understand the orders or commands that are given by the officers to the troops They learn the right ways to obey the orders They do a lot of exercise to improve their fitness and strength They learn about weapons first aid and their uniforms and kit Recruits also learn how to march Learning to march is sometimes called drill By the time soldiers finish boot camp they should know enough to be a helpful person in their group The camp usually finishes with a parade in which the newly trained recruits show off their marching and other skills they have learned in front of important visitors Once the recruits are fully trained they are ready to defend their country from attack or to go to war if necessary

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and other things make food It is a chemical process that turns carbon dioxide into organic compounds especially sugars using sunlight As well as plants many kinds of algae protists and bacteria use it to get food Photosynthesis is very important for life on Earth Most plants either directly or indirectly depend on it The exception are certain organisms that directly get their energy from chemical reactions these organisms are called chemoautotrophs

Photosynthesis can happen in different ways but there are some parts that are common

Photosynthesis has two main reactions Light dependent reactions which need light to work and light independent reactions which do not need light to work

Light energy from the sun is used to split water which has been sucked in by plants by transpiration The sunlight hits chloroplasts in the plant causing an enzyme to break apart the water Water when broken makes oxygen hydrogen and electrons 

The hydrogen converts to NADPH which is then used in the light independent reactions Oxygen diffuses out of the plant as a waste product of photosynthesis and ATP is synthesized from ADP and inorganic phosphate This all happens in the grana of chloroplasts

During this reaction sugars are built up using carbon dioxide and the products of the light dependent reactions and various other chemicals found in the plant in the Calvin Cycle Therefore the light independent reaction cannot happen without the light dependent reaction Carbon dioxide diffuses into the plant and along with chemicals in the stroma of the chloroplast and ATP and NADPH glucose is made and finally transported around the plant by translocation

There are three main factors affecting photosynthesis

If there is little light shining on a plant the light dependent reactions will not work efficiently This means that photolysis will not happen quickly and therefore little NADPH and ATP will be made This shortage of NADPH and ATP will lead to the light independent reactions not working as NADPH and ATP are needed for the light independent reactions to work

Carbon dioxide is used in the light independent reactions It combines with NADPH and ATP and various other chemicals to form glucose Therefore if there is not enough carbon dioxide then there will be a build up of NADPH and ATP and not enough glucose will be formed

There are many enzymes working in photosynthetic reactions  such as the enzyme in photolysis These enzymes will not work as well or stop working at all at high or low temperatures and therefore so will the light dependent and light independent reactions

A casserole is a baked dish of many different types of food usually mixed together Usually one of the ingredients is a can of soup Many people like to cook casserole because it is a very simple meal It was invented when women started to work more and was a simple way to cook a nutritional meal A very popular type of casserole is green bean casserole which has green beans milk or cream and fried onions

A plate is a type of dish where food can be placed after being cooked for eating Sometimes they are called dishes They may be made out of ceramic plastic paper or styrofoam

A plate is also one of the broken pieces of lithosphere of the Earth

All plates have irregular shapes They lie and float on the upper mantle They move very slowly in different directions Their movement is driven by the convection currents in the magma

A plate can contain both oceanic and continental crusts Some contain oceanic crust only

The flea is an insect that lives on many kinds of animals and sometimes humans Fleas are considered parasites and they drink the blood of the animal they bite 

Fleas can live outdoors in sand or tall grass and they will jump to any passing animal and lay eggs Flea bites are usually red bumps and they itch They can carry disease and make animals sick

There are several types of fleas including the dog flea cat flea human flea northern rat flea and the oriental rat flea During the Middle Ages the oriental rat flea that spread a bacteria that caused the Bubonic Plague also known as the Black Death or Black Plague a huge epidemic the size of todays bird flu The oriental rat flea would become infected by the bacteria yersinia pestis After infected the bacteria grew inside of the flea eventually blocking the path to their stomach Because of this the flea was always hungry When the flea would bite a human it opened up the skin and since the stomach of the flea was blocked the blood from the human was heaved up back into the human but only this time it was infected with the Bubonic plague bacteria

Terrorism is the use of terror and acts of violence in order to intimidate societies or governments Many different types of social or political organisations might use terrorism to try to achieve their goals People who do terrorism are called terrorists

Terrorism is often done by various political organizations both right wing and left wing political parties nationalistic groups religious groups revolutionaries as well as by governments that are in power One form is the use of violence against noncombatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group cause or individual

The Republic of South Africa is a country in the southern region of Africa About forty five million people live there South Africa is next to Namibia Botswana Zimbabwe Mozambique Lesotho and Swaziland 

The biggest city is Johannesburg the capitals are Cape Town Pretoria and Bloemfontein This is because the government is based in Pretoria the parliament is in Cape Town and the Supreme Court is in Bloemfontein Because of this South Africa has three capital cities for different purposes

There are 11 national languages They are Afrikaans English Ndebele Xhosa Zulu Swati Setswana Sesotho Sesotho sa Leboa Venda and Tsonga They are also known as National Lexicography Units Because of all the languages the country has an official name in each language

One of South Africas most known people is Nelson Mandela He was its president from 1994 until 1999 The current president is Jacob Zuma

The first European people to come to South Africa were Portuguese explorers In 1487 Bartolomeu Dias found what he called the Cape of Storms The king of Portugal changed it to Cape of Good Hope He called it this because the cape gave the Portuguese a new chance to find a sea route to India

In 2009 Jan van Riebeeck colonized the Cape He did alot of drugs like cocaine this by starting a refresh stationTom cruisess son was also born at this time He started the camp for the Dutch East India Company This was so that they could give fresh food to ships on their way to the south of Asia There were very few native people living in the Cape Because of this slaves were brought from Indonesia Madagascar and India to work at the colony In 1795 Great Britain took the Cape from the Dutch East India Company This was because it wanted to stop France from taking it It was given back to them in 1803 It was then annexed in 1807 when the Dutch East India Company went bankrupt

Diamonds were found in South Africa in 1867 Gold was found in 1884 This made a great number of people to come to South Africa from Europe They were hoping to make money

The First Boer War happened in 1880 1881 The war was between the British and the Boer Republics At that time the British had the Cape The Boer Republics were established when Dutch settlers moved north in the Great Trek The British soldiers and their commanders lost the war They came back 8 years later in 1899 They won the war in 1902 The British had brought much more soldiers the second time The Boers had no chance of winning At this time the British made use of concentration camps This weakened the Boers It helped the British stop the war from lasting any longer On May 31 1910 the Union of South Africa was made from the Cape and Natal colonies It was also made from Orange Free State and the Transvaal These were two Boer Republics

South Africas military is the most powerful in southern Africa South Africa spends more on its military than any of its neighboring countries do They have very advanced weapons as a result South Africa used to have nuclear weapons but they were taken apart in 1993

South Africa is found at the southernmost region of Africa with a long coastline that reaches more than convertabbron2500kmmi0 and along two oceans At convertabbron1219912km2mi2 South Africa is the 25th largest country in the world and is almost the size of Colombia Njesuthi in the Drakensberg at convertabbron3408mft is the highest part in South Africa

The back of South Africa is a big and flat It is a very populated scrubland the Karoo which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert The eastern coastline however is well watered which makes a climate kind of like the tropics 

To the north of Johannesburg the altitude drops beyond the broken wikt linkescarpmentescarpment of the Highveld It then turns into the lower lying Bushveld an area of mixed dry forest and a lot of wildlife East of the Highveld beyond the eastern escarpment the Lowveld reaches towards the Indian Ocean It has mostly high temperatures and is also the location of subtropical agriculture

South Africa has a mostly temperate climate Because of being surrounded by the Atlantic and Indian Oceans on three sides where its found in the climatically milder southern hemisphere and due to the average elevation growing towards the north and further inland Because of this varied topography and oceanic influence great many of climatic places exist

The climatic places vary from the desert of the southern Namib in the farthest northwest to the subtropical climate in the east along the Mozambique border and the Indian ocean From the east the land quickly rises over mountains towards the back plateau known as the Highveld Even though South Africa is thought as semi arid there is a difference in climate as well as topography

The southwest has a climate similar to that of the Mediterranean with wet winters and hot dry summers This area also makes much of the wine in South Africa This region is also mostly known for its wind which blows almost all year The wind can sometimes be severe when passing around the Cape of Good Hope mostly gets bad for sailors making many shipwrecks Further east on the south coast rainfall falls more evenly throughout the year making a green landscape This area is popularly known as the Garden Route

The Free State is mostly flat because of the fact that it lies in the center of the high plateau North of the Vaal River the Highveld becomes better watered and does not get subtropical heat Johannesburg in the center of the Highveld is at 1740 m and gets a yearly rainfall of 740 mm Winters in this region are cold although snow is rare

South Africa is ranked sixth out of the worlds 17 megadiverse countries with more than 20000 different kinds of plants or about 10 of all the known species of plants on Earth making it very rich in plant broken wikt linkbiodiversitybiodiversity The most common biome in South Africa is the grassland mostly on the Highveld This is where grasses low shrubs and acacia trees mostly camel thorn and whitethorn are more common then plants Plants become even more less common towards the northwest This is because of low rainfall There are many species of water storing plants like aloes and euphorbias in the very hot and dry Namaqualand area The grass and thorn savanna turns slowly into a bush savanna towards the north east of the country with more thick growth There are many numbers of baobab trees in this area near the northern end of Kruger National Park

South Africas economy is divided It is divided between First World and Third World standards The developed part of the economy is similar to that of most nations with wealth The rest of the economy is closer to that of poor nations such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo The main companies in South Africa are mining car making and service industries such as insurance

Unemployment is very high Income inequality is about the same as Brazil During 19952003 the number of older jobs went down Informal jobs went up Overall unemployment got worse The average South African household income went down a lot between 1995 and 2000 As for racial inequality Statistics South Africa said that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household In 2000 the average white family was earning six times more than the average black household The action policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth There is a developing black middle class Other problems are crime corruption and HIVAIDS South Africa suffers from mostly heavy overall regulation compared to developed countries Owning states and fighting stopped people from entering in lots of places broken wikt linkRestrictiveRestrictive labor rules have added to the unemployment weakness

South Africa is a nation of about 50 million people of diverse origins cultures languages and religions The last census was held in 2001 and the next will be in 2011 Statistics South Africa had five racial categories by which people could classify themselves the last of which unspecifiedother drew not needed responses and these results were not sounted The 2009 middle year estimated figures for the other categories were Black African at 793 White at 91 Colored at 90 and Indian or Asian at 26

Even though the population of South Africa has grown in the past decade the country had an yearly population growth rate of 0501 in 2008 counting immigration The CIA thinks that in 2009 South Africas population started to grow again at a rate of 0281 South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million illegal immigrants counting about 3 million Zimbabweans A series of anti immigrant riots happened in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008

It may be suggested that there is no single South African culture because of its ethnic diversity Today the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and marketed to tourists who wish to taste South African food Food is not the only thing music and dance is there too

South African food is mostly meat based and has spawned the South African social gathering known as a braai or barbecue South Africa has also developed into a big wine maker It has some of the best vineyards lying in valleys around Stellenbosch Franschoek Paarl and Barrydale

Most South African blacks still have poor lives It is among these people however that cultural traditions live most strongly This is because blacks have become broken wikt linkurbanisationurbanised and Westernised parts of traditional culture have fallen Urban blacks normally speak English or Afrikaans in addition to their native tongue There are smaller but still important groups of speakers of Khoisan languages who are not in the eleven official languages but are one of the eight other officially recognized languages

Members of middle class who are mostly white but whose ranks are growing numbers of black colored and Indian people have lifestyles similar in many ways to that of people found in Western Europe North America and Australasia Members of the middle class often study and work from foreign countries for greater exposure to the markets of the world

According to the 2001 national census Christians accounted for 797 of the population This has Zion Christian Pentecostal Roman Catholic Methodist Dutch Reformed Anglican members of other Christian churches accounted for another 36 of the population Muslims accounted for 15 of the population Hinduism about 13 and Judaism 02 151 had no religious affiliation 23 were other and 14 were unspecified

South Africas most liked sports are soccer rugby union and cricket Other sports with good help are swimming athletics golf boxing tennis and netball Soccer is the most liked among youth There are other sports like basketball surfing and skateboarding that are becoming more liked

Famous boxers from South Africa are Baby Jake Jacob Matlala Vuyani Bungu Welcome Ncita Dingaan Thobela Gerrie Coetzee and Brian Mitchell There are football players who have played for major foreign clubs Some of them are Lucas Radebe and Philemon Masinga Quinton Fortune Benni McCarthy Aaron Mokoena Delron Buckley and Steven Pienaar South Africa made Formula One motor racings 1979 world champion Jody Scheckter Famous current cricket players are Herschelle Gibbs Graeme Smith Jacques Kallis JP Duminy and more Most of them also participate in the Indian Premier League

South Africa has also made many world class rugby players Some of them are Francois Pienaar Joost van der Westhuizen Danie Craven Frik du Preez Naas Botha and Bryan Habana South Africa hosted and won the 1995 Rugby World Cup at their first try They won the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France South Africa was only allowed to participate from 1995 since the end of Apartheid It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting the 1996 African Cup of Nations It had the national team Bafana Bafana going on to win the tournament It also hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup and the 2007 World Twenty20 Championship Both of them were a great success South Africa will be the host nation for the 2010 FIFA World Cup This will be the first time the tournament is held on the African continent

In 2010 South Africa became the first African nation to host the FIFA World Cup It bid for the right to stage the 2004 Olympic Games but finished third to Athens South Africa is also well known for their cricket team They are right now the worlds number one in test match cricket

Hiroshima is the name of a city and prefecture in Japan Hiroshima is the capital city of Hiroshima Prefecture It is the largest city in the Chugoku region of western Japan About a million people live in Hiroshima

In the late Sengoku period and Edo period Hiroshima was the capital of local daimyos A big and beautiful castle Hiroshima jo was built Its nickname is Rijo meaning Castle of the Carp

Hiroshima was the site of the first ever atomic bombing near the end of World War II The bomb exploded over Hiroshima at 816 on the morning of August 6 1945 Much of the city was destroyed Over 100000 people were killed many instantly and many afterwards because of radiation sickness It is now estimated that 140000 people were killed by the explosion The bomb was nicknamed Little Boy after President Theodore Roosevelt More people died later because of cancer or other illnesses caused by the radiation between 1950 and 1990 approximately 21343 people died of cancer resulted from the radiation caused by the atomic bomb A building near the blast center still remains and is called the Atomic Bomb Dome

Near to Hiroshima there is a small island called Miyajima The island is known for its deer An old Shinto shrine named Itsukushima Shrine is also here It is said that Itsukushima shrine was built at the end of the 5th century The shrine is known for its use of red colored wood and especially for the torii gate that leads into the shrine which is partly underwater at high tide Today Itsukushima shrine and the Atomic Bomb Dome are registered as World Heritage sites Also it was a landing site for the US

There is a professional baseball team in the city called the Hiroshima Carp

The Richter magnitude scale is a scale of numbers used to tell the size of earthquakes Charles Richter developed the Richter Scale in 1935 His scale was based on the seismogram measured by a particular type of seismometer at a distance of 100 kilometres from the earthquake 

Earthquakes that are 45 or higher on the Richter scale can be measured by tools all over the world

The scale is logarithmic with a base of 10 The amplitude of an earthquake which scores 30 is about 10 times the amplitude of one that scores 20 The energy that is released will increase by a factor of about 32

The earthquake with the biggest recorded magnitude was the Great Chilean Earthquake It had a magnitude of 95 and occurred in 1960 Approximately 6000 people died because of the earthquake 

A day is the time it takes the Earth to spin around once It is day time on the side of the Earth that is facing the Sun When it is night time that side of the earth is facing away from the Sun It takes 24 hours for the earth to spin once so that is one day including the day time and night time

 There are only 29 days in February during a leap year Otherwise February has 28 days

The phases of the moon are the different ways the moon looks during the month As the Moon moves in space different parts of it face the Sun This means that different parts of it are lit up We only see one side of the moon from Earth because it rotates so that one side is always facing us The moon phase takes between 273 days The phases of the moon appears to be a circular disk which is illuminated to some degree by direct sunlight

A sphere is a shape in space that is like the surface of a ball Usually the terms ball and sphere are used alike But in mathematics the precise definition only allows points in the 3 dimensional space which are uniformly and symmetrically located at a fixed length called radius of the sphere

Examples of these are basketballs superballs and playground balls

In other places sphere means the earthfact

A sphere is the 3 dimensional analogue of a circle

Surface area of a sphere

Quantity or amount is how much of something there is that can be counted or measured 

Whole numbers are used to count things This can be done by pointing to each one As things are pointed to a number is said Start with the number one Each time another thing is pointed to the next whole number is used When the last thing in a group it pointed to that number is the quantity of the group 

Measuring is done with a ruler or a machine We put a ruler next to a thing to measure how long it is We put things on a scale to measure their mass Other machines are used to measure temperature speed or electricity

When measuring things a whole number might not be the best answer A distance might be longer than 5 meters but less than 6 meters Meter sticks are marked off in parts of a meter Decimals are formed by marking off a ruler in ten equal parts Each part is a tenth 52 meters is a little bit longer than 5 meters 57 meters is a little bit shorter than 6 meters Each of these tenths can be marked with ten smaller parts The one hundred centimeters on a meter stick are done this way

Fractions are used when there are parts of a whole number The dial on a machine may be marked with four parts between each whole number A scale with a bag of potatoes may show five and three fourths kilograms This would be almost six kilograms

People often use the word amount when they should say number The word number should be used if a particular number could be put eg

Advertising is a way a company encourages people to buy goods services companies and ideas usually performed by an identified sponsor and performed through a variety of media Advertisers influence our identity by making adverts Many people agree that they influence our identity and they have a huge impact on our life They influence our identity by using things such as techniques stereotypes and targeting our audience Our personal identity is who we are and what things make us up such as occupation beliefs personality self esteem lifestyle relation ships friends how we look and what we wear Advertisers use techniques to grab peoples attention For example to make a burger look tasty in advertising it may be painted with brown food colouring sprayed with waterproofing to prevent it from going soggy and sesame seeds may be superglued in place Advertising can bring new customers and more sales for the business It can be expensive but can help make a business make more money

Advertising happens in many different ways Many products are advertised on television although not all channels permit advertising Billboards advertise products on city streets these may simply be freestanding billboards or may be part of street furniture such as a bus shelter Buses and taxis are often covered in adverts while budget airlines sometimes allow advertising inside their planes Adverts also appear in newspapers magazines and sports programmes Many stadiums have adverts set around them Sports teams tournaments television programmes and public events sometimes have sponsors Advertising also takes place on the internet and teletext

Advertisers use many different techniques to get people to notice there adverts often using deliberately shocking or provocative images Sex is also often used by advertisers in this way Once they have managed to make people notice their advert they need to sell the product or brand They may try to make the product look appealing however often advertisers use humour to get people to remember the brand without actually promoting the product Poor adverts can damage sales or spoil a brands identity

Advertising is often strictly regulated for instance in the United Kingdom it is illegal to advertise tobacco except in the shop where it is sold and this is also restricted In France it is illegal to advertise alcohol meaning that when many European football teams play in France they cannot play in their usual shirts as breweries often advertise on sports shirts It is also illegal to advertise on some television channels the BBC in the United Kingdom and RTE in the Republic of Ireland are not allowed to permit advertising and instead make their revenue from selling a compulsory television licence

A Buddha is a very holy person in Buddhism The word Buddha means He woke up in Sanskrit Buddha was born Siddhartha Gautama He was the man who started Buddhism Sometimes people call him the Buddha Other times people call any person a Buddha if they have found enlightenment If a person has not found enlightenment yet but is very close to reaching it then he is called Bodhisattva

In early Buddhism Buddha meant only Siddhartha Gautama Later an idea began that there could be many Buddhas some in the past some maybe in the present and some in the future 

Since Buddhism tradition thinks Buddha is an ideal person tradition reached a notion of 36 ideal features of Buddhas Some of those features are represented on statues of Buddhas Some other features like the feature of their foot are difficult to be represented on a statue 

Buddhists believe that the Buddha was enlightened which means that he knew all about how to live a peaceful life and how to not to suffer in an afterlife They think he never got depressed frustrated upset or confused He is said to have never argued with other people but just said what was true and useful out of compassion

Sujin Boriharnwanaket taught

Some Buddhists pray to Buddhas but Buddhas are not gods Buddhas are just teachers to help people who will listen A Buddha is a human being who has woken up and can see the true way the world works This knowledge totally changes the person beyond birth death and rebirth Nothing can annoy him anymore even the circulation of incarnation since his enlightenment put him outsides of this eternity circle in time and space This person can help others become enlightened too in a proper way

There are ideas which are said to lead someone to enlightenment They are called the Dharma meaning the way or the truth Anyone can become a Buddha it is said but it is very hard Age and gender do not matter Buddhists believe there have been many Buddhas who were alone called pacceka buddhas They reached enlightenment on their own but they did not teach others The first Buddha was afraid to teach people too Their poor understanding made them hard to teach But he did teach people and people followed him

The flag of the United States of America is a national flag

The flag of the United States has 7 red stripes and 6 white stripes These 13 stripes stand for the 13 original colonies The flag also has a blue canton a rectangle in the top left corner The canton has one white star for every state 

When a new state joins the United States a new flag is made with an extra star The new flag is first flown on the 4th of July Independence Day

The last states to join so far the United States were Alaska and Hawaii in 1959 Alaska joined on 3 January 1959 so the new flag with 49 stars was used from 4 July 1959 Hawaii joined on 21 August 1959 so the flag with 50 stars that is used today was not flown until 4 July 1960

The colors in the flag are red white and blue The colors have no special meaning in the flag but in the coat of arms white stands for purity and innocence red for bravery and strength and blue for watchfulness perseverance and justice 

The flag is also often called the Stars and Stripes the Star Spangled Banner or Old Glory The national anthem and national march of the United States both reference the flag

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was a famous spiritual leader and politician from India the Father of the Nation He is also popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi Mahatma means great soul in the Indian language Sanskrit Now he is the Martyr of the Nation since 1948 Rabindranath Tagore gave him this name

During Gandhis life many countries were colonies of the United Kingdom Many of these countries wanted independence from the United Kingdom 

Gandhi was one of the most important people involved in the movement for the independence of India He was a non violent activist who led the independence movement through non violent protest 

Gandhi was born on October 2 1869 in the state of Gujarat at Porbander in India Several members of his family worked for the government of the state When Gandhi was older he went to England for a few years to study law After he became a lawyer he went to the British colony of South Africa where he experienced laws that said people with dark skin had fewer rights than people with light skin He decided then to become a political activist so he could help change these unfair laws He created a powerful non violent movement 

When he returned to India he helped cause Indias independence from British rule inspiring other colonial peoples to work for their own independence break up the British Empire and replace it with the Commonwealth 

People of many different religions and ethnic groups lived in British India Many people thought that the country should break into separate countries so that different groups could have their own countries In particular many people thought that Hindus and Muslims should have separate countries Gandhi was a Hindu but he liked ideas from many religions including Islam Judaism and Christianity and he thought that people of all religions should have the same rights and could live together peacefully in the same country He said God has no religion

In 1947 British India Empire became independent and broke into two different countries India and Pakistan Gandhi wanted independence but did not want the split into two different countries Instead of celebrating on independence day he was mourning the division of India

Gandhis principle of satyagraha often translated as way of truth or pursuit of truth has inspired other democratic and anti racist activists like Martin Luther King Jr and Nelson Mandela Gandhi often said that his values were simple based upon traditional Hindu beliefs truth and non violence 

On January 30 1948 Gandhi was assassinated by an extremist Hindu activist Nathuram Godse who was angry because he felt that Gandhi was too broken wikt linklenientlenient towards Muslims

Schizophrenia is a mental illness that causes unusual thinking and feelings Many people who have this illness hear things that do not exist They have fears and suspicions that do not make sense They might believe in things that are strange and senseless They might speak and think without logic They find it difficult to act normally with other people or to keep employment The symptoms usually begin in young adults after the age of 16 years About 03 to 07 percent of the worlds population will develop the condition at some time during their lives Observed behavior and the persons reported experiences help to determine whether someone has the disease

Several important factors might cause schizophrenia These factors include being related to someone with the condition a persons early environment the system of nerves that control a persons body and mind and mental and social processes Some drugs including prescription drugs can cause symptoms or make them worse Current research focuses on the role of the nerve system although no one has found one isolated organic cause The many possible combinations of symptoms have started debate about whether the illness is one disorder or many separate disorders The word schizophrenia comes from two Greek words that mean to split and mind But schizophrenia does not mean a split mind or cause people to have multiple personalities Many people confuse schizophrenia with such conditions

Treatment is mainly with drugs to relieve serious symptoms These drugs stop activity in the parts of the brain that process the chemical called dopamine Mental therapy help finding and keeping work and social rehabilitation are also important treatments In more serious cases if there is chance that a person could hurt themselves or others a person might need to be put into a hospital This step might happen with or without the persons agreement However hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were

Schizophrenia is thought mainly to affect mental processes but it also causes long term problems with behavior and emotion People with schizophrenia are likely to have other conditions as well including depression and anxiety Nearly 50 percent of people with schizophrenia abuse drugs at some point Social problems such as long term unemployment poverty and homelessness are common On average people with schizophrenia die 12 to 15 years earlier than people without the disorder People with schizophrenia have more physical health problems and are about 5 percent more likely to kill themselves

People who have schizophrenia might hear or see things that do not exist hearing voices is common They might have strange thoughts and worry that someone wants to harm them Their speech and thoughts might be disorganized They might lose their train of thought form sentences that are connected in meaning only loosely or not make sense at all Social withdrawal sloppiness in dress and hygiene and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia An observable pattern of emotional difficulty such as a lack of responsiveness also often occurs A weak understanding of social interactions is associated with schizophrenia and people with schizophrenia often think that others want to harm them As a result people with the condition commonly isolate themselves from others In one uncommon subtype of the condition the person might be mostly unable to speak might remain motionless in strange positions or be upset for no reason

Persons around 18 years or age and in early adulthood are at the peak periods for schizophrenia These years are crucial in a young adults social and career development In 40 percent of men and 23 percent of women who are diagnosed with schizophrenia the condition showed itself before the age of 19 To minimize the developmental disruption that is associated with schizophrenia much work has recently been done to identify and treat the phase of the illness that occurs before symptoms begin This pre onset phase has been detected as long as 30 months before symptoms begin During the pre onset phase people who go on to develop schizophrenia might have brief or self limiting serious or violent symptoms as well as the non specific symptoms of social withdrawal annoyance a general feeling of extreme unhappiness and clumsiness

The psychiatrist Kurt Schneider made a list of symptoms that he thought made schizophrenia different from other serious mental illnesses He called these first rank symptoms They include believing that an outside force is controlling one putting in or taking thoughts out of ones mind or sending ones thoughts to other people They also include hearing imaginary voices that talk about ones thoughts or actions or talk with other imaginary voices These first rate symptoms are important in deciding if a person has schizophrenia However a review of studies that were done between 1970 and 2005 did not find a strong agreement among studies and suggested that first rank symptoms should be not be as important in deciding if someone has schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is often described in terms of positive symptoms and negative symptoms Positive symptoms are symptoms that most people do not experience but that are present in people with schizophrenia Positive symptoms include bizarre thoughts that do not make sense They include disorganized thoughts and speech They also include feeling hearing seeing smelling or tasting things that do not exist These hallucinations prevent people from knowing what is real or imaginary and typically relate to the persons delusions Positive symptoms usually respond well to drug treatemnt Negative symptoms are actions or abilities that most people do or have but that are not present in people with schizophrenia For example a lack of normal emotional responses or thought processes are negative symptoms These symptoms do not usually respond to drug treatment Negative symptoms include flat or dulled emotions They also include poverty of speech A person will not experience pleasure they will not want to form relationships with others and they lack motivation Research suggests that negative symptoms contribute more to poor quality of life functional disability and the burden on others than positive symptoms do People whose negative symptoms stand out often have a history of poor adjustment before symptoms appear and their response to drug treatment is often limited

A combination of a persons genes and environment plays a role in the development of schizophrenia People who have a family history of schizophrenia and who experience brief or self limiting serious symptoms have a 20 to 40 percent chance of being diagnosed one year later

Estimates of whether schizophrenia is inherited vary because separating the effects of a persons genes and environment is difficult The greatest risk for developing schizophrenia is having a first degree relative with the condition When a person with schizophrenia has an identical twin that twin also has the condition in more than 40 percent of the cases Many genes are probably involved each to a small degree Many possible candidates have been proposed including specific variations in the number of copies of a particular gene the NOTCH4 gene and the locations of certain organic substances called histone proteins A number of associations involving specific inherited human proteins have also been linked to the condition There appears to be a significant overlap in the genes that are involved in schizophrenia and the genes that are involved in bipolar disorder

If schizophrenia can be inherited one question is why genes that increase the likelihood of serious symptoms would evolve The evolution of such a condition would be unlikely One theory implicates genes that are involved in the evolution of language and inborn behavior However all theories have been proven to be untrue or remain unsubstantiated

Environmental factors that are associated with the development of schizophrenia include the persons living environment drug use and stress before birth Parenting style seems to have no effect although people with supportive parents do better than people with critical parents Living in an urban environment during childhood or as an adult has consistently been found to increase the risk of schizophrenia by a factor of two This is true even after taking into account drug use ethnicity and the size of ones social group Other factors that play an important role include whether the person feels socially isolated as well as social adversity racial discrimination failures in family functioning unemployment and poor housing conditions There is evidence that childhood experiences of abuse or trauma are risk factors for developing schizophrenia later in life

Several drugs have been linked with the development of schizophrenia About half of those people who have schizophrenia use drugs or alcohol excessively The drug marijuana might be a cause of the disorder However other drugs might be used only as coping mechanisms to deal with depression anxiety boredom or loneliness

Marijuana is linked to an increased risk of developing a serious mental illness depending on the frequency of drug use Frequent marijuana use has been correlated with twice the risk of serious mental illness and schizophrenia However the cause of this link has been questioned and it remains controversialDrugs and to a lesser extent alcohol can result in serious mental symptoms that present like schizophrenia Tobacco use is not believed to be a cause of schizophrenia However people with schizophrenia as a group use tobacco at much greater rates than the general population

Factors such as oxygen deprivation infection or stress and lack of healthy foods in ones mother during pregnancy might result in a slight increase in the risk of schizophrenia later in life People who have schizophrenia are more likely to have been born in winter or spring This might relate to increased rates of exposures to viruses before birth This difference is about 5 to 8 percent

Numerous attempts have been made to explain the link between altered brain function and schizophrenia One of the most common is known as the dopamine hypothesis This idea attributes serious mental symptoms to the mind misinterpreting the misfiring of certain nerve cells that produce the chemical dopamine

Many mental mechanisms have been implicated in the development and maintenance of schizophrenia Distorted perceptions of reality especially when under stress or in confusing situations have been identified in people who have or are at risk of developing schizophrenia Some symptoms that involve the ability to reason might reflect problems such as memory loss Others might relate to particular issues and experiences

Despite a demonstrated appearance of a lack of emotional reaction recent findings indicate that many individuals who have schizophrenia are emotionally responsive They seem to be particularly responsive to stressful or negative factors Such sensitivity might cause vulnerability to symptoms or to the disorder Some evidence suggests that the content of delusions and other symptoms can reflect the emotional causes of the disorder This evidence suggests that how a person interprets such experiences can influence their symptoms The use of certain behaviors to avoid imagined threats can contribute to how long the delusions last and how often they occur Further evidence for the role of mental mechanisms comes from the effects of mental therapy on symptoms of schizophrenia

People who have schizophrenia have changes in both brain structure and chemistry Studies that use brain testing and imaging technologies to examine functional differences in brain activity have shown that the differences seem to most commonly occur in the parts of the brain that manage memory organization emotions the control of impulsive behavior and language Reductions in brain volume although smaller than the reductions that are seen in Alzheimers disease have been reported in the frontal cortex and temporal lobes Whether these changes in volume are progressive or exist before symptoms of the condition appear is uncertain These differences have been linked to the mental deficits that are often associated with schizophrenia Because certain circuits of nerves are altered some experts think that schizophrenia should be thought of as a collection of nerve related disorders instead of one disorder

There has been a lot of study into the way the chemical dopamine works in the brain This happened after it was accidently discovered that an organic compound phenothiazine which blocks dopamine in the brain can reduce serious symptoms Also certain stimulant drugs that cause the release of dopamine can make the serious symptoms of schizophrenia worse This is called the influential dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia It proposes that over activation of certain nerve endings that receive dopamine causes the positive symptoms of schizophrenia This idea was claimed for about 20 years based on the fact that medicines that improve certain serious or violent mental symptoms block dopamine In the mid 1990s imaging studies provided evidence to support the idea The dopamine hypothesis is now thought to be too simple This is partly because newer non typical drugs can be as effective as older typical drugs This is true even though the newer drugs also affect the function of the chemical serotonin and might block less dopamine

Interest has also focused on glutamate a chemical that carries communication between nerves and the nerve endings that receive it This interest is largely because unusually low levels of those nerve endings are found after death in the brains of people who had schizophrenia and the discovery that medicines that block glutamate can cause symptoms and learning problems that look like the symptoms of schizophrenia Reduced glutamate function is linked to poor performance on tests that require organization and memory and glutamate can affect dopamine function These facts suggest that glutamate pathways might have an important role in the condition However positive symptoms fail to respond to medication that affects glutamate

The DSM IV TR or the ICD 10 criteria are used to determine whether a person has schizophrenia These criteria use the self reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in the behavior of the person followed by a clinical assessment by a professional in the field of mental health Symptoms that are associated with schizophrenia happen along a spectrum in the population A person can be determined to have the disease only if the symptoms are severe As of 2009 there is no objective test for determining whether a person has the condition

The ICD 10 criteria are typically used in European countries The DSM IV TR criteria are used in the United States and the rest of the world DSM IV TR is used more in research studies The ICD 10 criteria put more emphasis on Schneiderian top symptoms In practice agreement between the two systems is high

According to the revised fourth edition of the DSM IV TR a person must meet three criteria to be determined to have schizophrenia

If signs of disturbance are present for more than one month but less than six months then the diagnosis of a condition like schizophrenia applies Serious symptoms of mental illness that last less than one month might be diagnosed as a brief mental illness and various conditions might be classed as a psychotic disorder not otherwise specified Schizophrenia cannot be determined if the symptoms of a mood disorder are substantially present The condition cannot be determined if symptoms of widespread developmental disorder are present unless prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present or the symptoms are the direct result of a general medical condition or a substance such as drug abuse

The DSM IV TR contains five subtypes of schizophrenia although the developers of the next version of the DSM DSM 5 recommend that these subtypes be dropped

The ICD 10 defines two additional subtypes

Serious symptoms of mental illness can be present in several other mental disorders as well as in drug related problems Non bizarre delusions and social withdrawal can also be symptoms of other disorders Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive compulsive disorder also called OCD a disorder in which a person becomes totally caught up with certain ideas or actions They are found together more often than can be explained by pure chance However separating the obsessions of OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia can be difficult

A more general medical examination might be needed to rule out illnesses that can produce schizophrenia like symptoms For example delirium can cause visual hallucinations or unpredictable changing levels of consciousness can show a medical illness Investigations are not usually repeated after the first case of illness unless a specific medical indication or a negative reaction to drug treatment might be the cause

There is no clear evidence that treating schizophrenia early is effective There is some evidence which shows that early treatment improves short term outcomes for people who have a serious episode of mental illness These measures show little benefit five years later Attempting to prevent schizophrenia in the pre onset phase is of uncertain benefit and so is not recommended Prevention is difficult because there are no reliable markers for the later development of the condition

The main treatment of schizophrenia is using drugs to combat the serious mental symptoms This drug treatment is often used with mental and social supportPutting the person in hospital with their approval might occur for severe episodes Keeping a person in hospital for long periods of time has been uncommon since the 1950s but does still occurCommunity support services including drop in centers visits by members of a community based mental health team supported employment and support groups are common Some evidence shows that regular exercise improves the physical and mental health of people with schizophrenia

The first line mental treatment for schizophrenia is medication which can reduce the positive symptoms in about 7 to 14 days However medication fails to improve negative symptoms or problems in thinking significantly

The choice of which drug to use is based on benefits risks and costs It is debatable whether as a class typical or atypical antipsychotic medications are better Both types of medication have equal drop out and symptom return rates when typical types are used at low to moderate dosages Forty to 50 percent of people have a good response to medication 30 to 40 percent have a partial response and 20 percent have an unsatisfactory response The drug called clozapine is an effective treatment for people who respond poorly to other drugs But clozapine can lower the white blood cell count in 1 to 4 percent of people who take it Thi is a serious side effect

Typical antipsychotics are associated with a higher rate of uncontrolled reflexes or movements Atypical antipsychotic medications are associated with considerable weight gain diabetes and risk of developing metabolic syndrome a disorder than can increase the risk of heart problems and other serious illnesses Atypical antipsychotic medications have fewer of the first type of side effect However these differences are modest Some atypical antipsychotic medications are associated with a higher risk of death than others clozapine is associated with the lowest risk of death Whether the newer medications reduce the chances of developing a rare but serious nerve disorder is unclear

For people who are unwilling or unable to take drugs regularly long acting preparations of antipsychotics can be used When used in combination with mental and social interventions such preparations can help people to continue their treatment

Numerous mental and social interventions can be useful in treating schizophrenia Such interventions include various types of therapy community based treatments supported employment skills training token economic interventions and mental interventions for drug or alcohol use and weight management Family therapy or education which addresses the whole family system of an individual might reduce a return of symptoms or the need for hospitalizations The evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy in reducing symptoms or preventing their return is minimal Art or drama therapy have not been well researched

Schizophrenia has great human and economic costs The condition results in a decreased life expectancy of 12 to 15 years primarily because of its association with unhealthy behaviors An increased rate of suicide plays a lesser role These differences in life expectancy increased between the 1970s and 1990s However between the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century the differences did not change substantially in the country of Finland which has a health system with open access to care

Schizophrenia is a major cause of disability with active serious mental illness ranked as the third most disabling Approximately three fourths of people with schizophrenia have ongoing disability with symptoms that keep coming back Some people do recover completely and others function well in societyMost people with schizophrenia live independently with community support In people with a first episode of serious mental symptoms 42 percent have a good long term outcome Thirty five percent of the people have an intermediate outcome Twenty seven percent of the people have a poor outcome Outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing world than in the developed world although that conclusion has been questioned

People who have schizophrenia tend to kill themselves more than most people This rate has been said to be at 10 percent A more recent analysis of studies and statistics revised the estimate to 49 percent most often occurring in the period following the first appearance of symptoms or the first hospital admission Twenty to 40 percent try to kill themselves at least once Various risk factors include male gender depression and high intelligence

Schizophrenia and smoking have shown a strong association in studies worldwide Use of cigarettes is especially high in individuals who have schizophrenia with estimates ranging from 80 to 90 percent of these people being regular smokers as compared to 20 percent of the general population Those individuals who smoke tend to smoke heavily and smoke cigarettes with a high nicotine content

Some evidence suggests that paranoid schizophrenia might have a better prospect for independent living and occupational functioning than other subtypes of schizophrenia do

As of 2011 schizophrenia affects around 03 to 07 of people or 24 million people worldwide at some point in their lives More men are affected then women The number of males with the disorder is 14 times greater than that of females Schizophrenia usually appears earlier in men For males the symptoms usually start from 20 to 28 years of age but it is 26 to 32 years of age for females Symptoms that start in childhood middle or old age are much rarer Despite the received wisdom that schizophrenia occurs at similar rates worldwide its rate of likelihood varies across the world within countries and at the local level The disorder causes approximately 1 of worldwide disability adjusted life years The rate of schizophrenia varies depending on how it is defined

Accounts of a schizophrenia like condition were rare in the historical record before the nineteenth century but reports of strange unreasonable or uncontrolled behavior were common A detailed case report in 1797 and accounts that were published in 1809 are often regarded as the earliest cases of the illness in medical and mental health literatureSchizophrenia was first described in 1853 The condition was described as a distinct syndrome that affected teenagers and young adults and was termed dmence prcoce A similar term was used in 1891 in a case report of a serious mental disorder In 1893 a broad new distinction was made between this condition and mood disorder It was then believed to be primarily a disease of the brain particularly a form of dementia distinguished from dementia that typically occur later in life

Eugen Bleuler coined the term schizophrenia which translates roughly as split mind in 1908 The word was intended to describe the separation of functioning between personality thinking memory and perception The main symptoms were described as the four As flattened affect autism reduced association of ideas and ambivalence Bleuler realized that the illness was not a dementia because some of his patients improved rather than deteriorated and so he proposed the term schizophrenia instead Treatment changed almost completely in the mid 1950s with the development and introduction of the medication chlorpromazine

In the early 1970s the criteria for determining schizophrenia were the subject of numerous controversies which eventually led to the operational criteria that are used today Based on the results of the 1971 US UK Diagnostic Study schizophrenia was clearly being diagnosed to a far greater extent in the United States than in Europe This difference was partly the result of looser criteria for determining whether someone had the condition in the United States where the DSM II manual was used In Europe the ICD 9 manual was used A 1972 study published in the journal Science concluded that the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the United States was often unreliable These factors helped lead to the revision not only of how to determine whether a person had schizophrenia but of the whole DSM manual This revision resulted in the publication of the DSM III in 1980

The term schizophrenia is commonly misunderstood to mean that affected persons have a split personality Some people who are diagnosed with schizophrenia might hear voices and might experience those voices as distinct personalities Schizophrenia does not involve a person changing among distinct personalities The confusion arises partly because of the literal interpretation of the term The first known misuse of schizophrenia to mean split personality was in an article by the poet T S Eliot in 1933

Negative social judgement has been identified as a major obstacle in the recovery of people who have schizophrenia In a large representative sample from a 1999 study 128 percent of Americans believed that individuals with schizophrenia were very likely to do something violent against others and 481 percent said that individuals with schizophrenia were somewhat likely to do so More than 74 percent said that people with schizophrenia were either not very able or not able at all to make decisions concerning their treatment and 702 percent said the same of money management decisions The perception of individuals with serious mental illness as violent has more than doubled since the 1950s according to one analysis

In 2002 the term for schizophrenia in Japan was changed from Seishin Bunretsu By to Tg shitch sh in an attempt to reduce feelings of shame or embarrassment The idea that the disease is caused by multiple factors inspired the new name The change increased the percentage of people who were informed of the diagnosis from 37 percent to 70 percent over three years

In the United States in 2002 the cost of schizophrenia including direct costs and non healthcare costs was estimated to be 627 billion

The book A Beautiful Mind and the film of the same name describe the life of John Forbes Nash This mathematician and Nobel Prize winner had schizophrenia

A drink is a liquid that you can take into your body by using your mouth Typical drinks for humans include water tea milk coffee and juice All drinks are mainly water All life needs water to live Plants take in water through their roots which are found underground Most animals get water by drinking To drink means to take a drink into your body

A need is a thing that a living being plant or animal must have to live or to be happy A thing that someone would like to have but can live without is called a want 

Every person has the same basic needs for the body Humans have boldily needs of water food clothing and shelter to live The need for water is the most important because a person will die very quickly without drinking water In a warm place food is the next most important need In a cold place the need for clothes or shelter may be next most important because a person will soon die without these 

Other human needs are not so certain They are mostly needs for the mind It is often said that a person needs love family and friends These needs are for personal relationships They may also be wants It is true that a life may be better with these things but some friends can be bad or bad sometimes Good relationships can make life very happy Thinking about a need that is not possible can make a person very unhappy

Some of the study of philosophy is about questions like What are the needs of a human

Some scientists study the needs of human or animal minds and bodies The study of the mind is called psychology  words about the mind The study of bodily needs is part of medicine

Mecca or Makkah called Mecca in older texts is a city in Saudi Arabia 1294169 people live there The city is convert73kmmi inland from Jeddah in the narrow sandy Valley of Abraham convert277mft above sea level It is located convert81kmmi from the Red Sea 

Mecca is the holiest city in the Islamic world Every year millions of Muslims take a pilgrimage to Mecca This is called the Hajj where they follow in the footsteps of Muhammad All Muslims who are able to do so are expected to do the Hajj at least once in their life The Kaaba and Masjid al Haram the holiest mosque in Islam is situated here Mecca is closed to non Muslims except some journalists reporting on the Hajj

The Kaaba the small cubical building which Muslims pray towards is believed to have been built by Ibrahim and has been a religious center ever since Muslims believed that God commanded Ibrahim to send his second wife Hajar and her son Ismail there They found the Zamzam Well which led to people settling nearby and thus Makkah was born When Ismail was big enough he helped his father to build the Kaaba The kaaba is the place that the Muslims pray towards This is known as the Qibla and this is the only place which Muslims can pray towards

Arabia is a peninsula in Southwest Asia at the junction of Africa and Asia It lies east of Ethiopia and northern Somalia south of Israel the disputed Palestinian territories and Jordan and southwest of Iran

The coastal limits of Arabia comprise on the southwest the Red Sea and Gulf of Aqaba on the southeast the Arabian Sea and on the northeast the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf 

Arabia includes the countries of

The peninsula is part of the Middle East but that usually means the Arabian Peninsula with the Levant and Mesopotamia The word Arabia often refers only to Saudi Arabia

The country of Saudi Arabia covers almost all of Arabia The majority of the population of the peninsula live in Saudi Arabia and Yemen

South is one of the 4 main directions on a compass South is normally down on the bottom of most maps Australia is south of China Spain is south of France and Chile is south of Peru The South Pole is the farthest south you can go

Central America is a region stretching from Guatemala and Belize in the north west to Panama in the south east It is also known as the area of land that sits south east of Mexico and north west of Colombia between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea

This is a list of the countries in Central America from the largest to the smallest

Although Guatemala is not the largest country it has the largest population and contains the largest city Guatemala City 

All the countries in Central America are Spanish speaking apart from Belize whose people also speak English Some people also speak other languages such as the Maya languages

Central America is part of the continent known as North America

  

The weather in Central America is mostly very hot and humid because it sits in the tropics although it can be cooler on the mountains The land is very green and is covered with a lot of rain forest Sugar cane coffee and bananas grow here The area also has a lot of volcanoes because it sits between two tectonic plates

The French language is a Romance language that was first spoken in France Belgium Luxembourg Quebec and Switzerland About 200 million people speak French as a native or a second language Like most Romance languages its nouns have genders that are divided into masculine and feminine words

In ancient times the Celts lived in what is now France In those days the land was called Gaul The Romans spread their power to Gallia and made Gallia their provinces Because the Romans spoke Latin the local people learned Latin and began to speak it Their own language Gaulish tended to be spoken less often although Breton is a language still spoken today in the part of France called Brittany that came from the old Celtic language

After the Roman Empire fell and Germanic peoples swarmed the countryside Latin was changing quickly and in medieval France it changed into two accents or languages langue doc and langue dol They both mean language of yes because oc was the word for yes in the south and ol meant yes in the north Today the word for yes in French is oui pronounced like we 

Langue doc is now called Occitan and it is still spoken by many people in Southern France

Here are some examples of French words and sentences 

Many French words are like English words Words in different languages with the same meaning which are spelled similarly are called cognates Most English words ending with tion and sion originally came from the French language See below for more examples

A prime minister manages the politics of a country With countries that have kings and queens they are very important because they are in charge of most of the politics In countries with a president they might be in charge of most of the politics or they may be in day to day charge but taking orders from the president as in France

Greenland is a large Arctic island It has a population of only 50000 residents because of its cold climate Most of the population lives in the southern part of the island on the coasts The capital of Greenland is Nuuk Greenland is the worlds largest island that is not a continent The island is the least densely populated place in the world with a density of 026 people per square kilometer

Since the 1950s scientists think that the ice sheet that covers Greenland may hide three separate islands which are joined by glaciers since the last geologic ice age

In Greenland there are no forests In the south at the coastal area only some dwarf trees are found

Greenland is a Danish occupied territory of Denmark but Greenland is not a member of the European Union It is part of the North American continent and Greenland is the largest island in the world excluding Australia and Antarctica which are continents The prime minister of Greenland is Kuupik Kleist

The island is populated mostly by Inuit and Scandinavians who speak Greenlandic an Inuit language Danish is also spoken by most people The national anthem of Greenland is Nunarput utoqqarsuanngoravit

Until 2009 there were 18 communes in Greenland Unless stated otherwise the were in the district Kitaa

This changed on January 1st 2009 when these were merged into four large communes

In addition some parts of Greenland are outside a commune namely

As of January 1st 2008 218 people lived there

The island has many mountains All of the cities are on the coast because everywhere else is covered by a big layer of ice The major cities are Nuuk Sisimiut Ilulissat and Qaqortoq

A monarch is a ruler who rules because his parents ruled A male monarch is called a king A female monarch is called a queen Some monarchs are called emperors or empresses It is a system of ruling in which ruling starts off by a member of a family and is ruled one by one by a member and continues till end of a family Monarchs were very common in history A lot of countries used to have a monarch but no longer have them They are now republics Some countries that still have monarchs have other leaders that actually have the power These are called constitutional monarchies

Unit means part of something It could mean a unit of measurement or a unit in an army

Units sometimes means the digit in a number on the right which is also called the ones

Some other ideas come from this word

For example a football team may be called X United This means that the town of X has come together to support the group 

In the BBC TV series Doctor Who UNIT is a military group on earth who battle invading aliens

An uncle is a name used in an extended family A uncle is either a brother of one of someones parents or the husband of their aunt That person is the uncles nephew or niece An uncles child is a cousin 

The word information is used in many different ways Originally it comes from a word that meant to give a form to something Information is something that people can learn know about or understand For example a newspaper contains information about the world

People who use computers often use the words information and data in the same way There are special fields of study called information science and information technology

In the 1970s and 1980s some people gave a new specific meaning to information At that time the first computer databases were built In computer science data often means a kind of information that has not been checked That means data has not been changed or fixed and you may not be able to trust it With the new meaning information means data that has been checked and passed tests for what it must be A person can trust that information is correct

Information can only be correct and good enough to trust if there are very good and complete ways to check the data and decide it is good enough A person must know rules were used to check the data or trust the person who checked the data If a person cannot tell that this was done the information still seems to be data for that person so that person must check the data again in that general view about data

 An airport is a place where airplanes can land or take off Most airports in the world have only a long strip of level ground called a runway Many airports have buildings which are used to hold airplanes and passengers A building that holds passengers waiting for their planes or luggage is called a terminal The sections between the plane and the terminal are called gates Airports also have buildings called hangars to hold planes when they are not used Some airports have buildings to control the airport like a control tower which tells planes where to go

An international airport is a large airport that airplanes can use to fly to and from other countries A domestic airport is a airport which is usually smaller and only has airplanes coming from places in the same country Most international airports have shops and restaurants for airplane passengers to use

An airport used by the military is often called an air force base or airbase An aircraft carrier is a floating airbase

Today many airports think that safety is very important People must walk through a metal detector a machine that can tell if metal goes through it If it makes a noise the officers will make that person take off all things on them that are metal They also have X Ray machines that can look into luggage If officers find items such as weapons guns or anything that can be used to kill people they have that item taken away As well as this passengers are not allowed to bring bottles or containers with over 100 ml of liquid onto the plane because they could be turned into bombs Therefore all water bottles must be emptied before entering the secured area

Water becomes ice when it is very cold Liquid water freezes and becomes solid ice at a temperature of 0 Celsius

Ice is the common name for frozen water Other liquids could be called ice when they freeze but one would always say milk ice for instance instead of just ice

Places like Antarctica have lots of ice but people can also find it in home appliances like the refrigerator or freezer If people put water in a freezer and leave it for a while the water gets very cold and will freeze solid creating ice People can put water into a copper container if they want ice to freeze faster Copper is a very good conductor of heat it can freeze water faster than a regular ice tray would be able to Surprisingly an open tray of hot water can freeze faster than the same amount of cold water This happens because enough of the hot water can evaporate before cooling reducing the amount of water to be frozen

Unlike other liquids water expands as it freezes to become ice so ice floats on water because ice has less density than water This is very unusual  just about every other liquid gets more dense as it cools water ice however is an important exception Liquid water expands by about 9 as it becomes ice  it takes up more space If water in pipes freezes it can burst the pipe Water in glass bottles can explode in the freezer if people leave it there long enough to freeze Water freezing in rock crevices can expand enough to split hard rocks apart this is an important geological weathering process that can wear down mountains and make rock into soil

Salt water needs a lower temperature to freeze than pure water The resulting ice contains much less salt than the salt water it came from This salty ice is not as strong as frozen pure water Similarly spreading salt on ice melts it the salt progressively eats into the ice forming salty water which is not cold enough to be frozen at the same temperature

Because ice floats even large bodies of water that freeze like some oceans only form ice on the surface Most lakes never freeze to the bottom Even the coldest oceans like the Arctic only freeze on the top leaving liquid ocean circulating below Because of this the Earths oceans are able to redistribute heat and the climate of the earth has less extremes of heat and cold than it would otherwise If ice were to sink instead of float the oceans would fill up with ice from the bottom would remain solid and only some of the top would thaw A solid ocean would not circulate heat But because ice floats on the surface the water beneath can continue to circulate and the ice on the surface stays exposed and readily melts when the temperature rises

The earths climate is always changing When it is very cold its called an ice age Some speculate that most recent ice age finished only ten thousand years ago During ice ages very large areas of the earth are covered in ice snow and glaciers The causes of ice ages are complex or hard to understand Global warming is currently affecting the Earths ice resources and its causes are also very complex

When materials are cooled their molecules vibrate less and compact together When most materials reach a temperature called the freezing point the molecules form a crystalline solid  although some materials do not crystallise at all but form super stiff fluids which seem to be solid Only Helium will not freeze all other substances will freeze if cold enough but fluids like cooking oil anti freeze petrol nitrogen etc freeze at temperatures that most people will rarely if ever experience

There is also dry ice it is frozen carbon dioxide Dry ice exposed to normal air gives off carbon dioxide gas that is odorless and colorless The gas is so cold that when it mixes with air it cools the water vapour in the air to fog which looks like a thick white smoke It is often used in the theatre to create the appearance of fog or smoke

Travel is the activity going from one place to another location When a person makes the same trip every day to work or school this type of travelling is usually called commuting Some people travel to other cities as part of their job This is called business travel Some people travel on their vacation to visit other towns cities or countries These people stay overnight in hotels hostels motels apartments or bed and breakfast or perhaps in a tent  then they are campers With the changing times modes of travelling are also changing Some people write about traveling in books called autobiographies or journals

Types of travelling

Cable News Network is a television channel in the United States of America It was started by Ted Turner and its headquarters are in Atlanta Georgia It is one of the most watched networks in the US and around the world It was and is the first network to air infotainment 24 hours a day 

A leader is someone who has the authority to tell a group of people what do to A leader can also represent a group of people 

For example the Prime Minister of Canada has the authority to govern the society of Canada and represent the people of Canada

A blackboard also called a chalkboard is a surface on which markings made with chalk are visible It is used as a surface to write on

Blackboards are often used to help teach in school Blackboards are not used as much now People use whiteboards instead Whiteboards are used because some people are allergic to the dust the chalk used to write on chalkboards generate and because the dust is hard to clean up when spilled

Chalkboards are written on with chalk which is actually not the stone chalk at all It is actually made by factories Schoolteachers often use the chalkboard to display things at large Chalkboards can be black or dark green also called blackboards and greenboards Chalkboards use chalk the only to write on these is using chalk

Linux or GNULinux is a free and open source software operating system for computers The operating system is a collection of the basic instructions that tell the electronic parts of the computer what to do and how to work Free and open source software means that everyone has the freedom to use it see how it works and change it

There is a lot of software for Linux and since Linux is open source it means that most of the software for it is open source and free This is one of the reasons why some people like to use Linux

In the 1980s many people liked to use an operating system called Unix But because it restricted the user from sharing and improving the system some people made a new operating system that would work like Unix but which anybody could share or improve MINIX similar to Unix was used as a teaching tool for university students to learn how operating systems worked MINIX also restricted its sharing and improvement by its users

A group of people called the GNU project wrote different parts of a new operating system called GNU but it did not have all the parts an operating system needs to work In 1991 Linus Torvalds began to work on a replacement for MINIX that would be free to use and which would not cost anything Linus started the project when he was attending the University of Helsinki This eventually became the Linux kernel

Linus Torvalds shared the Linux kernel on some internet groups for MINIX users Linus first called the operating system Freax The name Freax came from joining up the English words free and freak and adding an X to the name because Unix has an X in its name Ari Lemmke who worked with Linus at the University was responsible for the servers that Freax was stored on Ari did not think Freax was a good name so he called the project Linux without asking Linus Later Linus agreed that Linux was a better name for his project

Linux relied on software code from MINIX at first But with code from the GNU system available for free it would be good for Linux if it could use that code instead of code from MINIX The GNU General Public License is a software license that lets people change any part of the code they want to as long as they share any changes they make with the people they give their software to The software from GNU was all licensed under the GNU General Public License so Linus and the other people who worked on Linux could use it too 

To make the Linux kernel suitable for use with the code from the GNU Project Linus Torvalds started a switch from his original license to the GNU GPL Linux and GNU developers worked together to integrate GNU code with Linux to make a free operating system

Because of the way that the new operating system was created by combining the work of the GNU project and Linus Torvalds many people say that its better to use the name GNULinux but most people just say Linux

Since then thousands of programmers and companies have worked to make Linux better

The mascot of Linux is a cartoon penguin named Tux When a person sees the penguin on software and hardware it means that it will work with Linux and sometimes all systems that are like Unix 

The idea of the penguin came from the creator of Linux Linus Torvalds The image was made by a man named Larry Ewing in a competition to create a logo The image Tux did not win but it was picked as a mascot later 

Tux has now become a symbol for Linux and sometimes even for open source He can be seen in many different places and often when people refer to Linux they think about Tux Tux has even been included in many video games such as Super Tux Tux Racer and Pingus

Although there are only a few Linux versions for some Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows programs in areas like desktop publishing and professional audio and video there are programs that are comparatively similar in quality compared to those available for Mac and Windows

Many free software titles that are popular on Windows such as Pidgin Mozilla Firefox Openofficeorg and GIMP are available for Linux A growing amount of proprietary desktop software can also be used under Linux such as Adobe Flash Player Opera Google Picasa RealPlayer and Skype CrossOver is a proprietary solution based on the open source Wine project that supports running older Windows versions of Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop versions until CS2 Microsoft Office 2007 and Adobe Photoshop CS3 are known not to work

GNULinux has mainly been used as a server operating system and has risen to be known by a lot of people in that area Netcraft reported in February 2008 that five of the ten best internet hosting companies run Linux on their web servers This is because of its stability and uptime and the fact that desktop software with a graphical user interface for servers is often unneeded

Linux is commonly used as an operating system for supercomputers As of November 2007 out of the top 500 systems 426 run Linux

Open source is a kind of software It is different from other software because the source code is available to everyone The source code is a set of instructions for the computer written in a programming language

Anyone can see how the source code works and can change it if they want to make it work differently The opposite of open source is closed source Closed source software is not available to everyone Open source is almost the same thing as free software

Open source and free software have been around for decades They became more popular with the Linux and BSD software communities To protect the code a special user license is used The most common kinds of licence are the GPL BSD and LGPL Wikipedia uses open source too The Open Source Movement is led by the Open Source Initiative

The open source movement became separate from the Free software movement in 1998

A desktop environment is a location on a personal computer that helps the user get around on the computer The desktop itself is a place in the operating system used for short cuts to computer files and folders on the hard drive Computer icons are used to represent filesfolders Clicking these icons will open or start a folder or program The desktop is the area where the start menu is if the computer has a start menu

Usually the desktop is the main screen on the computer If no programs or folders are open the computer will display the desktop

The most common desktop environment on personal computers is the one given by Microsoft Windows another common environment is the one given by Apple Mac OS X Other mostly used desktop environments for Unix like operating systems using the X Window System are KDE GNOME Xfce There are also other desktop environments including Aston EDE GEM IRIX Interactive Desktop Suns Java Desktop System Mezzo Project Looking Glass ROX Desktop UDE Xito XFast

OpenOfficeorg is a free open source office suite made by Sun Microsystems and the free software community It is available for many different operating systems including Microsoft Windows Linux OS X FreeBSD and Solaris and is meant to be an alternative to Microsoft Office It supports Microsoft Office file formats as well as its own OpenDocument format

The org part of the name OpenOfficeorg is there because OpenOffice is already trademarked It is often called OOo for short

OpenOfficeorg is based on the older StarOffice software that was created by Sun Microsystems

OpenOfficeorg is a collection of applications that work together closely to provide the features expected from a modern office suite Many of the parts are designed to be alternatives to those available in Microsoft Office The parts available include

Download means getting information from another computer or server The opposite of downloading is uploading which is sending data to another computer Usually we do not say download for a single web page When we say we downloaded something it is normally a bigger piece of information like data or a computer program

The word downloadable means the ability to get information or data from a primary source for ones use The source is expected to be authentic and have patent At the users end the downloaded information or data are to be used based on agreement notice

In the 21st century it is very easy to download files or informations  legally or not  from the internet

As most non technical users use the word download to talk about any data transfer the word sideload is sometimes being used to cover all local to local transfers to end this confusion

According to the GNOME website

The GNOME project puts heavy emphasis on simplicity usability and making things just work The other aims of the project are

GNOME has many applications written for it Some of them include

The dog is a mammal from the family Canidae It has been domesticated by humans for a long time It was the first animal ever to be domesticated Dogs are used by humans for many different things for work and as pets They are a popular pet because they are usually playful friendly and listen to humans Thirty million dogs in the United States are registered as pets Dogs eat both meat and vegetables often mixed together and sold in stores as dog food Dogs have jobs such as police dog army dog seeing eye dog fire dog messenger dog and much more

They are sometimes called canines from the Latin word for dog  canis Sometimes people also use dog to describe other canids such as wolves A baby dog is called a pup or puppy A dog is called a puppy until it is about one year old

Dogs are sometimes referred to as mans best friend because they are kept as domestic pets and are usually loyal and like being around humans

Dogs can smell and hear very well but cannot see well in color or they are color blind Dogs have four legs and make a bark or woof sound Dogs often chase cats and most dogs will fetch a ball or stick 

Dogs usually live about 10 years or more The size and the breed of the dog may change how long the dog lives Smaller dog breeds usually live longer

Like wolves wild dogs travel in groups called packs Packs of dogs are ordered by rank and dogs with low rank will submit to other dogs with higher rank The highest ranked dog is called the alpha male A dog in a group helps and cares about others Domesticated dogs often view their owner as the alpha male

All dogs are descended from wolves which has happened due to domestication and evolution This is known because DNA genome analysis has been done to find out They have been broken wikt linkbredbred by humans This is called selective breeding or artificial selection The earliest fossil of a domestic dog that has been found is from 31700 years ago in Belgium 

Dogs have lived with people for at least 30000 years They are often called mans best friend because of their kind nature Dogs can serve people in many ways For example there are guard dogs hunting dogs herding dogs and guide dogs for blind people There are also dogs that are trained to smell for diseases in the human body or to find bombs or illegal drugs These dogs sometimes help policemen in airports or other areas Sniffer dogs are sometimes trained for this job Dogs have even been sent by Russians into outer space a few years before any human being The first dog sent up was called Laika but died while there

There are at least 800 breeds of dogs Dogs whose parents were the same breed will also be that breed these dogs are called purebred or pure pedigree dogs Dogs with parents from different breeds no longer belong to one breed they are called mutts mixed breed dogs hybrids or mongrels Some of the most popular breeds are sheepdogs collies poodles and retrievers It is becoming popular to be breed two different breeds of dogs and calling the new dogs breed a name that is a mixture of the parents breeds two names A puppy with a poodle and a pomeranian as parents might be called a Pomapoo These kinds of dogs instead of being called mutts are known as designer dog breeds These dogs are normally used for prize shows and designer shows

Blindness is the inability to see anything Some people are called blind even though they can see a little bit This is because they cannot see clearly but only see fuzzy shapes or colours 

In modern countries few young people are blind In all the world blindness is mostly caused by malnutrition and diseases of old people like cataracts and trachoma People can become blind because of diseases or accidents but sometimes people are born blind

Some people are color blind which means they can see but cannot tell certain colours apart 

When people are blind they use such things as the alphabet in braille and guide dogs to do every day life things 

Famous blind people have included Louis Braille the inventor of the braille alphabet Stevie Wonder Ray Charles and Helen Keller 

The Arctic is the area around the Earths North Pole The Arctic includes parts of Russia Alaska Canada Greenland Lapland and Svalbard as well as the Arctic Ocean It is an ocean but it is always frozen so it is solid ice Most scientists call the area north of the treeline Arctic Trees will not grow when the temperatures get too cold The forests of the continents stop when they get too far north or too high up a mountain The place where in the trees stop is called the treeline

The area north of the treeline is not an empty ice field In fact the only ice covered land is central Greenland which is covered year round by a continental glacier The land of the Arctic is around the edges of the Arctic Circle and is usually covered with tundra A tundra is a cold almost treeless plain covered with moss and grasslike plants called sedges

Tundras do not get very much rain or snow However they are very wet in the summer time because three feet or so below the surface the ground is always frozen This permafrost is a layer of ice with the hardness of stone that keeps water from soaking into the earth beneath it Permafrost can be thousands of feet thick In the summer the ground on top thaws out when the sun shines and the snow that did fall melts But the melted snow cannot drain into the ground it just soaks the topsoil There is no place for the water to go except to form lakes and puddles on top of the ground until it freezes again or dries up

In the Arctic during summer there are nights when the Sun never sets This is because during summer there the North Pole points toward the Sun So sometimes people call it the Land of the Midnight Sun

The word comes from the Greek word meaning bear The North Pole aims at the stars called the Great Bear and the Little Bear This is why it is called the Arctic

In some parts of the Arctic the ground is covered with bright colored flowers during the short summer These little plants have very short stems They must stay close to the ground because the earth is warmer than the biting winds that blow above it Even some rocks have plants growing on themThese rock plants are called lichens Lichens will grow on the bare rocks Yellow reindeer moss is really a lichen It grows slowly but often grows over six inches tall It is spongy and full of water This plant is the summer food for reindeer

Trees are almost seen on the tundra Only in the protected valleys or along the riverbanks are small trees able to grow Rivers come into the Arctic from the warmer south The places along their banks are a little bit warmer than the rest of the tundra This means trees can grow there 0therwise only a few clusters of bushes grow sparingly Berries are the only fruit that grows in the Arctic

Each summer the ice and snow will melt allowing the animals to find food and the plants to flower The moisture from the snow stays toward the top of the grounds surface Plant roots can use it for their growth Even so in many places the soil is too poor for plants growth Less than half of the tundra has plants growing on it

The polar bear is the worlds largest meat eating land animal Polar bears were perfectly designed to hunt seals out on the ice They are excellent swimmers and the coldest water does not bother them They just jump into any leads that open in the pack ice and swim across They are quiet enough to sneak up on a sleeping seal and strong enough to kill it with one blow They have a very strong sense of smell which they use to find prey out on the ice Polar bears live most of their lives out on the pack ice Males go to the land only when the ice is gone The females however will dig themselves into a den of snow on land for the winter There the mother bears have their cubs usually twins Bears usually eat fish birds eggsd seaweed and dead whales but they would rather have a meal of seal or walrus The Arctic fox will often trail the bears onto the ice to eat their leftover food The fox also eats rabbits lemmings and voles The lemmings and voles are the rats and mice of the Arctic The lemmings have very short tails They live underground in summer Because the top soil freezes in the winter they cannot burrow underground then so they live under the snow during the colder months They eat plants and roots If they find plenty of food they wil have extra large families that year

In a year with plenty of food millions of lemmings will be roaming the tundra The owls and foxes have more food than they can eat They will have extra babies in they years when there are so many lemmings However the tundra does not have enough food for millions of lemmings They rush across the tundra looking for food and are eaten by predators or starve to death Some try to swim across lakes or rivers and drown The few that remain continue to have families

Caribou and their relative the reindeer live in the Arctic too The caribou are now found mostly in North America and they are larger than the reindeer Large herds feed on the grass and lichens When fall comess they move south to winter feeding grounds They dig through the snow with their sharp hoofs for food Their hollow fur creates a cushion of air around them that helps them to stay warm In the spring they return north to the summer pastures where their calves are born An hour or so after being born the calves are able to follow the herd toward the Arctic Ocean Most of the worlds reindeer live in Europe and Asia Some of these reindeer are not wild They have been tamed by herdsmen who protect them from wolves and lead the migrations each spring and fall Also the musk ox which looks like a shaggy buffalo lives in the Arctic

In summer many birds visit the Arctic and most of them are water birds such as geese ducks swans loons and Arctic terns Flying in for the summer they raise their young and return south for the winter The snowy owl and the ptarmigan stay all year The color of the snowy owl matches the snow The ptarmigans summer feathers change to white when it gets colder

The smallest animals of the Arctic are the flies and the mosquitoes Mosquitoes and black flies love the wet summer tundra Thick swarms of large hungry bugs bite both men and animals The reindeer try to escape the mmosquitoes by running to higher pastures but the only real help comes with the snow and cold when the pesky swarms die off for another season 

One of the surprises of the Arctic is that many people live there Some people have lived there for thousands of years Eskimo and Lapp people lived in the Arctic long before electric heaters snow mobiles and modern houses

In an extremely northern part of Europe there is a place called Lapland It is not a country but parts of four countries The people who lived there are called Lapps by outsiders They call themselves Sami The Lapps of these four countries lived there long before the countries of Northway Sweden Finland and Russia were created There were several kinds of Lapp people Some lived by the ocean and lived mostly on fish Another group lived along the warmer rivers These people did a little farming hunting and fishing to live 

But the best known of the Lapp people were the nomads who raised reindeer The Lapps survived in their harsh homeland by domesticating the reindeer The Lapps were able to get everything they needed from the deer They ate mostly meat milk and cheese Their clothes were made froom reindeer skins and wool Their tents were also made from deer skins They are known for the beautifully decorated woolen clothing they made

The Lapps protected the herds moving with them as they migrated from summer to winter pastures They used trained reindeer to pull sleds carrying their supplies During the winter the herds moved south of the treeline The Lapps would live nearby in homes made of logs or sod The Lapps were very careful not to waste anything they got from the reindeer Milk was taken from the reindeer to drink or make cheese Meat was taken for food The blood was frozen in chunks and used for soup and pancakes Knives and belt buckles were carved from the bones and antlers The sinews were used as sewing thread Cleaned out stomachs were used to carry milk or cheese Every part of a dead reindeer was used

Winter clothing was made from layers of deer skin The inside layer would be worn with the fur facing in toward the persons skin The second layer was worn with the fur facing out Boots were also made of fur lined with grass that had been gathered during the short summer Every evening the grass would be taken out and dried by the fire so it would be ready to use again the next day Thus a Lapp could be warm and comfortable in even the coldest weather

Today only a few of the Lapp people still follow the herds Those few use modern tools on their ancient migration They use snowmobiles to herd the reindeer and rifles to kill the wolves that chase them Even helicopters and radios are used to locate and move the reindeer Most of the Lapp people now live on small farms in one of the four nations of Lapland They raise crops and animals including a few reindeer to meet their needs The sale of reindeer meat is an important source of income for the Lapp people

Eskimos are Arctic people too They ate raw meat Eskimos were also nomads but they did not have any animals except for dogs which they used for pulling their sleds and helping them hunt They were hunters and gatherers and they lived off on whatever they found or killed Like the Lapps though they were very careful to maek good use of every part of the animals they killed Eskimos lived in tents during the summer and sod houses or igloos in the winter The Eskimos made very clever things from the bones antlers and wood they had They invented the harpoon which was used to hunt and they built boats Eskimos did not have a government or laws because they learned early in life to help each other in order to survive Always sharing food they usually moved around in small groups looking for food Sometimes theyd get together in a large group when they hunted big animals such as whales The men did the hunting and building the homes and the women cooked made the clothes and took care of the children

The Arctic region has many minerals that are important to people Iron lead coal copper gold and tin are all mined in different parts of this cold land Large amounts of petroleum have been discovered in the Arctic in Russia Alaska and Canada People live and work in the Arctic to remove these valuable minerals and sell them

The oil in Alaska for example is very important to the United States The main source of the oil is near Prudhoe Bay on Alaskas north coast It was discovered in 1968 Plans were quickly made to build a pipeline to bring the oil to an ice free port so it culd be shipped south Oil companies spent billions of dollars to build the Trans Alaska Pipeline in the mid 1970s It had to be built above the ground in the northern section because of the permafrost The warm oil in the pipies could have melted the permafrost and caused the ground to sink That would have broken the pipes and caused an oil spill The pipeline was completed in 1977 It brings oil to the seaport of Valdez on Alaskas south coast From there the oil is taken by huge tankers to refineries along the west coast of the United States If you live in western America your family car may have Alaskan gasoline in its tank

Russia has more land in the Arctic than any other nation The Russian Arctic in Asia and the area just south of it are called Siberia It is such an empty harsh place that it has been used as a enal colony for many years The old Russian rulers and the modern communist Soviets would send criminals and people who disagreed to the government to live there However many people were also sent there to remove minerals harvest trees from forests and build cities

Russia has a huge port city right in Lapland within the Arctic Circle Murmansk is the largest city north of the Arctic Circle The port is kept ice free by the warm waters of the Gulf Stream coming up around Norway and Sweden froom the South Atlantic Huge icebreakers work to keep a path open so ships can reach the port The port ships out fish minerals and lumber to Russia and the rest of the world

The Arctic is also the shortest way for airlines to fly between some cities on different continents The flight from London to Tokyo for example is 1400 miles shorter if flown across the top of the world instead of the old route south across Europe and Asia The polar route from San Francisco to Norway is several hours shorter than the same flight going across the United States and the Pacific Ocean

Thus man is making use of the Arctic in various ways even though it is a hard place to live

A sin is something that a religion tells its believers is a bad thing to do usually because the thing is believed to draw people away from God and happiness

Religions usually say that God told them that some things are sins through prophets Usually the sacred books of a religion talk about sins There are some things that most religions agree are sins For example almost every religion agrees that it is wrong to kill people 

There are other things that are sins in only a few religions For example Muslims and Jews say that it is wrong to eat pork but other religions do not think that its wrong to eat this 

Most religions describe sins as actions that break their rules 

Summer is one of four seasons It is the hottest season of the year In some places summer is the wettest season and in other places it is a dry season Four seasons are found in areas which are not too hot or too cold Summer happens to the north and south sides of the Earth at opposite times of the year In the Northern Hemisphere summer takes place between the months of June and September and in the Southern Hemisphere it takes place between December and March This is because when the Northern Hemisphere or part of the Earth points towards the Sun the Southern Hemisphere points away

A month is an amount of time used with calendars It is about one twelfth of a year It is a little longer than a natural period of the moon 2953 days In some cultures the idea for months came from moon phases People have counted days based on moon phases for a very long time Some calendars are still strongly based on the moon or lunar calendars 

Others called solar calendars ignore the moon and depend entirely on the Sun for example the Gregorian calendar of 365 or 366 days used in much of the world today

Alberta is a province in Canada It lies in the western part of Canada The province of British Columbia is west of Alberta The province of Saskatchewan is east of Alberta It is north of Montana one of the states in the United States 

Alberta is the fourth largest Canadian province It has an area of 642317 km Alberta has 3305800 people There are three provinces in Canada that have more people 

The capital of Alberta is Edmonton Edmonton is close to the middle of Alberta Calgary is another city in Alberta It is south of Edmonton 

Alberta has a huge amount of oil and natural gas 

There are also a lot of farms in Alberta Farmars grow several different types of crops Farmers mainly grow wheat There are also a lot of cows on Alberta farms and Alberta beef is exported

Some parts of Alberta gets a lot of snow in the winter Alberta can be very cold in the winter There is a dry part of Alberta in the south

Alberta was made a province of Canada in 1905 

Scalars are simple numbersThey are used for measuring things Many things can be measured and the measure can be explained by only giving the number

Suppose we are measuring a rod We could give the measured length as 2 metres or 3 cm etc depending on the length of the rod under observation Here only the figure 2 or 3 along with the unit of measure is enough to transmit information about the rod

Other examples of scalars are 

ie mass is measured by scalars distances are measured by scalars

The other family of measurement falls under the category of vectors

Photons in many atomic models in physics are particles which transmit light In other words light is carried over space by photons Photon is an elementary particle that is its own antiparticle

Photons have a rest mass of 0 However Einsteins theory of relativity says that they do have a certain amount of momentum Before the photon got its name Einstein revived the proposal that light consists of separate pieces of energy These particles came to be known as photons

A photon is usually given the symbol 

Photons are fundamental particles Although they can be created and destroyed their lifetime is infinite

In a vacuum all photons move at the speed of light c which is equal to 299792458 meters per second

The last usable property of a photon is its polarity If you saw a giant photon coming straight at you it could appear as a swath whipping vertically horizontally or somewhere in between Polarized sunglasses stop photons swinging up and down from passing This is how they reduce glare as light bouncing off of surfaces tend to fly that way

LCD screens also use polarity to control which light passes through Even some animals can see light polarization

Finally light has a spin to it A photons spin is a subtle feature and requires expensive equipment to detect

In particle physics photons are responsible for electromagnetic force Electromagnetism is an idea that combines electricity with magnetism One common way that we experience electromagnetism in our daily lives is light which is caused by electromagnetism Electromagnetism is also responsible for charge which is the reason that you can not push your hand through a table Since photons are the force carrying particle of electromagnetism they are also gauge bosons Some mattercalled dark matteris not believed to be affected by electromagnetism This would mean that dark matter does not have a charge and does not give off light 

Light is often created when energy hits an electron This energy can be in the form of heat kinetic energy or any other form The increase of energy can push an electron up one level in a shell called a valence All that this means is that it is unstable there and like all everything else wants to be in the lowest energy state When the electron drops back down to its lowest energy state it needs to release the energy that hit it and it must obey the conservation of energy Electrons release this energy as photons and at higher intensities this photon can be seen as visible light

A vector is a mathematical object that has a size called the magnitude and a direction

For example a vector would be used to show the distance and direction something moved in If you ask for directions and a person says Walk one kilometer towards North thats a vector If hed say Walk one kilometer without showing a direction it would be a scalar

Vectors are usually represented as an line with an arrow at the end

The Head to Tail method of adding vectors is useful for doing an estimate on paper of the result of adding two vectors To do it

Its called the Head to Tail method because each head from the previous vector leads in to the tail of the next one

See link for an example created with Java

A soap bubble is a very thin film of soap water Their shape is a hollow round ball or sphere They have a colorful surface Soap bubbles do not last very long Sometimes they break in the air When they touch something else they usually break When people talk about soap bubbles they think about them being pretty but short lived So they are a symbol for other things that are pretty but short lived or unimportant Children enjoy playing with bubbles Sometimes adults enjoy seeing art done with soap bubbles

The Fire Brigades Union is the main union for firefighters in the United Kingdom A union is a group of workers They make the group to improve pay and working conditions It was founded in 1918 in the London area as the Firemans Trade Union It soon grew to cover the entire country  Today it has around 50000 members

The word force means to make someone or something do something 

For example Soldiers came to the town and forced all the people there to leave

Scientists also use the word force In the science of physics a force causes objects to change the way they are moving When equal forces act in opposite directions they cancel each other out 

Gravity is a force It makes things move toward each other On the Earth we see that it makes things fall toward the ground 

In the Star Wars saga the Force is a type of energy released by all living things that binds the galaxy together enables life and can be controlled by Jedi and Sith knights

Opposite forces make boats float Gravity makes the boats weight pull it down but water pushes it up The weight is spread over a large area so the water has a lot to push on and holds the boat up

A bicycle or bike is a small human powered land vehicle with a seat two wheels two pedals and a metal chain connected to cogs on the pedals and rear wheel A frame gives the bike strength and all of the parts other than the frame are attached to the frame The name comes from these two wheels  the prefix bi meaning two and the suffix cycle meaning wheel It is powered by a person riding on top who pushes the pedals around with his or her feet

Riding bicycles which is also called cycling is an important way to travel in several parts of the world It is also a common recreation a good form of low impact exercise and a popular sport It is also the second most popular broken wikt linkspectatorspectator sport in the world Bicycling uses less energy per mile than any other human transport

In 1817 a German professor baron Karl von Drais created the first two wheeled bicycle It was made of wood and had two wheels The front wheel could be turned using the handlebars in order to steer the bike However it did not have pedals so the rider would have to push their feet on the ground to make it move

In the 1860s French inventors added pedals to the front wheel However it took a lot of effort to turn the pedals Later inventors made the bikes out of metal only and made the front wheel very big making it easier to pedal This design was called the penny farthing bicycle However it was difficult to ride since it could fall over easily

In 1885 the safety bicycle was invented This had two wheels the same size so that the rider could sit at a lower height It was called the safety bicycle because it much easier to ride than the penny farthing Instead of pedaling and steering with the front wheel the safety bicycle used steering with the front wheel while the pedals turned the back wheel using a chain

The bicycle soon became very popular during the 1890s and a number of improvements were made In 1888 Scottish inventor John Boyd Dunlop invented a type of tire which was filled with air and this made cycling far more comfortable Soon the freewheel was invented This was a device inside the hub of the back wheel that allowed the wheel to spin even if the rider wasnt pedalling However this meant the rider could no longer stop the bike using the pedals As a result a type of brake was invented which could stop the bike if the pedals were turned backwards

Later inventions included brakes which the rider could use by pulling levers on the handlebars and gears which made cycling up and down hills much easier

Basic components common to most bikes include a seat pedals gearing gear shifter handlebar wheels brakes cables and frame elements The cyclist turns the pedals around in circles which turns the chain which turns the back wheel of the bike The front wheel 

The mountain bicycle is used for riding on rough roads They have many speeds wide tires and powerful wheels The tire broken wikt linksimpletreadtread is specially designed to ride smoothly on hills grass and mountains

The Urban bicycle is used for the convenient ride around the city Its comfortable and has a relatively high speed It has a comfortable seat but is heavy It usually has fenders to keep water and mud from spraying the rider

The difference between a womans bicycle and other bicycles is the location of the top tube When women began to ride bikes they wore long skirts The manufacturers of bicycles changed the location of the top tube to make it easier for women to sit down on them while wearing a skirt

The tandem is a bicycle for 2 people It has two pairs of pedals The cyclists sit one behind another The first cyclist steers the bicycle There are bicycles for 3 and more people There was a bicycle for 40 people

Electric bicycles have electric motors normally found inside the hub of either the front or rear wheel You can choose to ride using the motor only or with pedals only or with both together 

In the US the federal government has set a limit of 750 Watts and a top electric powered speed of 20MPH to have only the rules that apply to bicycles and no extra broken wikt linkrestrictionsrestrictions such as operator license vehicle license registration or insurance requirements

A road bicycle usually has smaller tires less than 1 thick with a frame that is much lighter than a mountain bicycle Road bikes are a great option for training longer distances and changing out the pedals for clip in shoes are the best way to go There are variations as some road bicycles have regular tires A road bike can go very fast and is a good choice when participating in a bike race

When riding on streets it is safest to ride on the same side of the street that cars drive To avoid hitting people riders must obey signs that say no bicycling even if it does not seem to make sense at the time Low light makes bicycle lighting important so without bicycle lighting it may be safer not to ride Wearing a helmet makes bicycle riding safer More than 300000 people children alone to go to a hospital every year because they were hurt riding a bicycle Wearing a helmet does not mean that somebody cannot be hurt if they crash their bicycle but it makes being hurt less likely Some bicycles have bells or horns that the rider can use to warn other people that they are riding by them

A wheel is a disc or circle shaped mechanical device Its main purpose is to allow things to roll in other words the wheel spins and objects on the wheels move more easily along the ground It is a simple machine

Most experts believe the ancient Mesopotamians invented the wheel about 8000 BC In addition the ASIA discovered it on their own around 3500 BC The Inca and Maya had wheels on childrens toys around 1500 BC but they did not use wheels for work Africa south of the Sahara desert and Australia did not have the wheel until people there met people from other cultures

Today wheels are used in cars carts planes wheelchairs bikes trains and skateboards in addition to many more devices Wheels are usually used in pairs connected by a rod of wood or metal known as an axle 

The word exercise means

People do physical exercises as a part of their healthy lifestyle to get stronger and healthier or stay strong and healthy or to improve their body image There are three basic modes of physical exercises

Exercises can be an important part of physical therapy weight loss or sports performance

Exercise can be fun but it is important for the exercisor to do what he likes and eat enough calories so when he exercises he is building up muscles not just breaking them down for fuel Carbohydrates are muscle sparing and if one does not get enough calories overall there is the risk of burning muscles up with the fat to make up the deficit

Benefits of exercise for all ages have been known since antiquity Marcus Cicero around 65 BC stated It is exercise alone that supports the spirits and keeps the mind in vigor 

Regular exercise has been shown to help high blood pressure obesity heart disease diabetes and depression among others

Percent means out of one hundred It is often shown with the symbol It is used even if there are not a hundred items The number is then scaled so it can be compared to one hundred For example I have a bowl of fruit with three apples and one orange The percentage of apples is 3 out of 4 34 75100 75

Percentages are useful because people can compare things that are not out of the same number For example exam marks are often percentages so people can compare them even if there are more questions on one exam paper than the other In coding it can mean modulo

Writing is the act of recording language on a visual medium using a set of symbols The symbols must be known to others so that the text may be read 

A text may also use other visual systems such as illustrations and decorations These are not called writing but may help the message work Usually all educated people in a country use the same writing system to record the same language To be able to read and write is to be literate 

Writing differs from speech because the readers need not be present at the time We can read writing from long ago and from different parts of the world It works across time and space It stores and communicates knowledge Writing is one of the greatest inventions of the human species It was invented after people had settled in towns and after agriculture had started Writing dates from about 3300BC which is over 5000 years ago in the Middle East 

A variety of writing materials were invented long before paper Clay papyrus wood slate and parchment have all been used The Romans wrote on waxed tablets with a pointed pen this was popular for temporary notes and messages The later invention of paper by the Chinese was a big step forward

The medium used today is usually paper though there is technology to print on almost any surface Media such as television and movie screens can also be used to display writing and so can computer screens

Writing is traditionally done using a hand tool such as a pencil a pen or a brush More and more however text is created by input on a computer keyboard

Writing was invented independently a number of times The Sumerian the Ancient Egyptian the Chinese and the Mayan writings are separate in their inventionp85 All these writing systems started with pictographs symbols that stood for things Then they developed a mixture of methods Our own alphabetic system is different It is based on the sounds of spoken language All alphabets are modified versions of the first one which originated with the Phoenicians and the Ancient Greeks

The Sumerians lived in Mesopotamia between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers 5000 years ago this was a fertile region and is now mostly in Iraq The Sumerians developed a form of writing called cuneiform Triangular marks were pressed into soft clay tablets After the clay had dried in the sun the tablets were baked Then they were carried somewhere else for others to read We know that its first uses were for trade accounting and administration

The earliest signs were mostly pictorial but soon they stood as symbols for objects ideas and sounds This writing system was extremely successful and outlasted the Sumerian empire It was then used by other civilisations in the Middle East such as the Old Akkadian Babylonian Assyrian Elamite Hittite Old Persian and Ugaritic empires The last cuneiform inscription was dated as AD75 Thus the system had lasted for more than 3000 yearsp71 Each version of cuneiform had to be deciphered separately because all the languages were different Documents written in more than one language provided the clues

This is the most famous of the old forms of writing or scripts It was invented at roughly the same time as cuneiform yet was quite different in style and used different materials Egyptians ended up with three writing systems for the same language They were

The two cursive scripts were written with reed pens and carbon inks onto papyrus also by brush onto cloth Many examples survive The hieroglyphs were carved into stone or painted onto stone surfaces Many survive some with the original colours intact The key event in the decipherment of hieroglyphic writing was the discovery of the Rosetta Stone This is a granite slab with the same message written in hieroglyphic demotic and in Greek Ancient Greek is well understood and made possible the interpretation of the other two scripts

Chinese is the language with the largest number of native speakers Its history dates back to about 1400BCp183 The Chinese writing system is idio syllabic a mixed method using characters which may have one or more of these elements

Chinese has a huge number of characters in the region of 50000p186 Because of this printing methods were never really successful in China despite their early invention In the 14th century Wang Tzhen had sixty thousand wood block characters cut a huge investment in time and money He printed 100 copies of a local gazette and was author of a treatise on agriculture and other technical works Even with printing machines from Europe in the 19th century the process was hampered by the huge number of characters which slowed the composition to a snails pace

China has eight regional languages that are mutually unintelligible and many true dialects The system appears to work mainly because as many as 70 speak Mandarin Fluency in Chinese reading and writing is undoubtedly difficult to achieve and this must act as a brake on the drive for literacy There have been a number of attempts to reform or simplify the system The most radical in Pinyin which is a program to replace Chinese characters with an alphabetic system This was supported by Mao but faltered after his death

It seems that the idea of an alphabet a script based entirely upon sound arose only once and has been copied and adapted to suit many different languages Although no alphabet fits its language perfectly it is flexible enough to fit any language approximately It was a unique inventionp12

Our alphabet is called the Roman alphabet as compared with the Cyrillic and other alphabets All of these come from the ancient Greek alphabet which dates back to about 1100 to 800BCp167 The Greek alphabet was probably developed from the Phoenician script which appeared somewhat earlier and had some similar letter shapes 

The Phoenicians spoke a Semitic language usually called Canaanite The Semitic group of languages includes Arabic Maltese Hebrew and also Aramaic the language spoken by Jesus We do not know much about how the alphabetic idea arose but the Phoenicians a trading people came up with letters which were adapted by the early Greeks to produce their alphabet The one big difference is that the Phoenician script had no pure vowels Arabic script has vowels which may but do not have to be shown by diacritics The oldest Quran manuscripts had no diacritics and Israeli children to about the third grade use texts with vowel dots addedp89 

No ancient script alphabetic or not had pure vowels before the Greeks The Greek alphabet even has two vowels for e and two for o to distinguish between the long and short sounds It is fairly clear from this that careful thought went into both the Phoenician invention and the Greek adaptation However no details survive of either process

Semitic scripts apparently derive from Proto Sinaitic a script of which only 31 inscriptions are known It is thought by some researchers that the original source of this script was the Egyptian hieratic script By the late Middle Kingdom hieratic had added some alphabetic signs for representing the consonants of foreign names Egyptian activity in Sinai was at its height at that time A similar idea had been suggested many years previously

There are a number of scripts which have never been deciphered despite much effortp145 Perhaps the most famous are the script of the Indus Valley civilization and the Etruscan script The Indus River civilisation predates other literate civilisations on the Indian subcontinent going back to about 2500BC Their cities of Mohenjo Daru and Harappa were well planned with good drainage The script is found on seal stones terracotta bronze bone and ivory All are brief and the language is unknown 

The Etruscan language used Greek letter forms and is found mainly on Etruscan tombs from Tuscany through to Venice They were an empire before the Romans who defeated them and absorbed their ideas All knowledge of their language was lost except that some of the names on tomb memorials can be read from the Greek letters

It is only in the last 150 years that most people have been able to read and write in Europe and North America In many other parts of the world this did not happen until the 20th century Until then literacy was mainly for clerics that is people who had training as priests Even wealthy people were often illiterate and used scribes to write for them The invention of printing came before mass literacy Before 1500 each book had to be created by hand so there were few books available compared to the billions in the world today Mass literacy needed cheap books

Even now there is still widespread illiteracy

The ordinary use of writing by means of a pen and paper Can refer to writing for oneself as in a diary but mostly it refers to sending letters Once it was almost the only means of communication between people who were separated Now the telephone and e mail are the most common means of distance communication

Rock is used to mean many things 

Plato was a very important classical Greek philosopher He lived from 427 BC to 348 BC He was a student of Socrates and the teacher of Aristotle Plato wrote about many ideas in philosophy that are still talked about today In fact one modern philosopher said that all philosophy since Plato has just been comments on his works

Plato wrote his books in the form of dialogues  people talking about ideas and sometimes disagreeing about them This makes Platos books more interesting to read 

Socrates is usually the main person in Platos dialogues Usually Socrates talks with people about their ideas and tries to see if they believe anything that is illogical Other people in the stories often become angry with Socrates because of this People who study Plato argue about whether Socrates really said the same things that Plato makes him say or whether Plato just used Socrates as a character to make the ideas he was talking about seem more important

One of Platos most famous works is The Republic In that work he describes Socratess vision of an ideal state The method of questioning in this dialogue called the Socratic method is as important as the content The Republic contains ideas of Socrates Socrates said it Plato wrote it 

Plato also wrote the Laws 

There are many dialogues that were supposed to be written by Plato But because he was such a famous philosopher some later philosophers said that their works were really written by him to make their works seem more important

In the list on this page a work is marked if scholars are not sure that Plato really wrote it and it is marked if scholars generally agree that Plato did not really write it

A book is a set of printed sheets of paper held together between two covers The sheets of paper are usually covered with a text language and illustrations that is the main point of a printed book

A writer of a book is called an author The person who draws pictures in the book is called the illustrator Books can have multiple authors or illustrators 

A book can also be a text in a larger collection of texts That way a book is perhaps written by one author or it only treats one subject area Books in this sense can often be understood without knowing the whole collection Examples are the Bible the Illiad or the Odyssey all of them consist of a number of books in this sense of the word Encyclopedias often have separate articles written by different people and published as separate volumes Each volume is a book

Hardcover books have hard covers made of cardboard covered in cloth or leather and are usually sewn together Paperback books have covers of stiff paper and are usually glued together The words in books may be read aloud or recorded on tapes and compact discs 

Books can be borrowed from a library or bought from a bookstore People can make their own books and fill them with family photos drawings or their own writing Some books are empty inside like a diary address book or photo album Most of the time the word book means that the pages inside have words printed or written on them

Some books are written just for children or for entertainment while other books are for studying something in school such as math or history Many books have photographs or drawings 

People who cannot read books or any type of writing are called illiterate

There are two main kinds of book text fiction and non fiction 

These books are novels about stories that did not happen and have been imagined by the author Some books are based on real events from history but the author has created imaginary characters or dialogue for the events 

Books of non fiction are about true facts or things that have really happened Some examples are dictionaries cookbooks textbooks for learning in school or a biography

Between the written manuscript and the book lie several inventions A book is an industrial product but manuscripts are hand made

A common type of manuscript was the scroll which was a long sheet rolled up The sheet could have been made of papyrus or parchment or vellum or paper Turning the manuscript into a book required several developments

The Romans were the first people to put separate pieces of manuscript between covers to form a codex This was more convenient to handle and store than scrolls but was not yet a book as we understand it

Scrolls and codices were written and copied by hand The Chinese invented woodblock printing where shapes are carved out of a block of wood then ink is applied to the carved side and the block is pressed onto the paper This way of making books was very slow and so very few people had these kinds of books

Johannes Gutenberg was the first to invent a machine for printing the printing press in the 15th century This involved more than just a press it involved the production of movable metal type suitable for the machine process

Initially the machines were slow and needed a printer to work with them Fast and automatic machines did not arrive until the 19th century

Paper had been invented in the 8th century but hand made paper was expensive and in short supply In the 19th century automated or semi automated making of paper from wood pulp was invented Also there was the invention of inks for various purposes and machines driven by electricity

The common cheap supply of paper fed the faster prining machines and books became cheaper Only then could ordinary people afford to buy books Along with these inventions in the 19th century came the idea of public libraries so poorer people could get access to the best books Also widespread free education swelled the number of literate people

Printing was done on large sheets of paper which were then folded guillotined and sewn in sections and finally placed into the covers All these processes became done by machines during the 19th century

Today some of the technologies have been changed especially those involving illustration and typography However books look much the same as they did with more illustration in colour but basically the same That is because experience has shown that readers need certain things for pleasurable reading Graphic design and typography are the practical arts used to make books attractive and useful to readers

A sundial shows the current solar time during the day It does this because the sun appears to move through the sky At different times in the day when the sun is shining a shadow is cast in different places on the dial A person marks the dial with the time at a certain shadow This lets users easily see the time There are a few commonly seen designs such as the ordinary or standard garden sundial However sundials can be designed for any surface where a fixed object casts a predictable shadow 

Ancient Egypt had sundials Other cultures developed them further including the Greeks and Romans

  

A peninsula is a region of land that sticks out in a body of water It is also defined as a piece of land with water on three sides Korea and most of the US state of Florida are peninsulas If Eurasia is considered a continent then the continent of Europe is technically a peninsula India is also a peninsula

A derivative is something created from a primary source and can mean different things

Combinatorial game theory is a mathematical theory of games It is sometimes called CGT It is part of general game theory It came from ideas from the solution to the game of Nim It also partly came from looking at the oriental game Go 

CGT proves things about combinatorial games A game must meet several conditions to be a combinatorial game These are

Very few of the games that people play for fun meet these conditions For example chess has draws 

These combinatorial games can be represented by trees each vertex of which is the game resulting from a particular move from the game directly below it on the tree These games can be assigned game values Finding these game values is of great interests to CG theorists as is the theoretical concept of game addition The sum of two games is the game in which each player on herhis turn must move in only one of the two games leaving the other as it was 

Elwyn Berlekamp John Conway and Richard Guy are the founders of the theory They worked together in the 1960s Their published work was called Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays

The dots mean there are many moves so not all are shown

Chess is very complex It is better to think of easier games Nim for example is much simpler to think about Nim is played like this

The easiest game of Nim starts with no counters at all In such a case neither player can move That is shown as as the symbol 0 

Nim is a simple game used for examples in combinatorial game theory The rules of nim are simple

There is a simple mathematical strategy to play the game perfectly If both players play perfectly the winner is determined by the initial setup

Memory is the part of the mind that keeps the things that you can remember It is the minds ability to store information to use later It is studied in a special science called cognitive psychology There are three main types of memory

Murder is when one person kills another person on purpose It is only called murder when it is against the law If a person does something that makes someone else die it is often known as manslaughter or homicide This is especially true if it was an accident Sometimes a death caused by someone else may not be a crime For example in some countries it is not a crime to defend yourself even if it kills the attacker A person who commits murder is called a murderer 

The legal definiton of murder and manslaughter may be different in different countries and is very much argued on for example killing in war is not usually called murder by those who take place in the war Killing in self defense is not usually murder

Assassination is a word which means murdering someone for a reason The word is most used when the person who was killed was a famous celebrity or was a person involved in politics The people who carry out assassinations are called assassins or Hit men An assassin may murder someone for political reasons for money or for other reasons such as favors owed

The word Assassin comes from Hashshashin a Muslim group that was active in the Middle East from the 8th to the 14th centuries This secret society killed people for political and religious reasons It is thought that the assassins were under the influence of hashish and opium during their killings or during their training The word assassin comes from either hashashim the influence of the drugs or hassansin after their leader Hassan i Sabbah 

The first use of the word assassination in a book is The Tragedy of Macbeth by William Shakespeare

Birds are a class of vertebrates the Aves

They are warm blooded and lay eggs Their bodies are covered with feathers and they have wings the function of which is usually flight Their bones are hollow This makes them lighter and allows many of them to fly 

Birds are bipedal having two legs that are often covered with scales They have a hard beak with no teeth 

Because birds keep a high body temperature they use lots of energy So they need to eat a lot of food compared with their weight 

More than 9000 different species of birds are known 

Birds are found on every continent of the world Birds of different types can live in freezing cold environments and others can live in hot deserts Birds live in forests in grasslands on cliff faces in river banks on stony sea shores down mine shafts and in the rooves of houses 

Different types of birds eat different foods Most birds are carnivorous meaning that they eat flesh at least some of the time Many birds live on insects or on fish Some eat small reptiles and mice Birds of prey eat mammals and other birds Some birds are scavengers and eat the bodies of creatures that have died Many birds such as parrots and finches live on seeds and fruit Some birds that eat mainly seeds feed their young on insects A few types of birds eat green plants but only one species lives on leaves Hummingbirds and Honeyeaters live on the nectar or honey in flowers 

Birds come in many sizes from the Bee Hummingbird that is only 60 mm long to the ostrich which stands 25 metres high The bird with the widest wingspan is the Wandering Albatross many of which measure 3 metres from tip to tip

All this applies to living birds Birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs and the early birds looked much like small carnivorous dinosaurs Much is now known about the origin of birds From fossils we know that these dinosaurs had feathers and early birds had teeth

Because birds live on every continent and have adapted to all sorts of conditions different types of birds look very different from each other The most noticeable differences are the size the shape of the beak the length of the legs the length of the neck and the colour

The smallest types of birds are tiny birds that feed on nectar honey and insects The biggest birds are flightless birds with long legs  ostriches emus and cassowaries However very large birds are also found soaring high in the sky  eagles vultures albatross and pelicans The way to understand the living habits of a bird is to look at its legs and feet its beak its neck and its wings 

If a bird has very long legs then it probably spends most of its time walking like a crane or wading like a flamingo Birds with long legs need long necks to match so they can reach their food Birds with short legs and long necks like pelicans geese and swans are birds that swim well and dive their heads into the water for food Their beaks are often flat for scooping up water weeds A pelicans beak can change into a shape like a huge bucket for catching fish

Birds that are shaped like torpedoes are good at diving Albatross seagulls and kingfishers all have long strong beaks for catching fish Some birds such as eagles owls vultures and hawks have beaks which are hooked and very large claws with which they can tear and carry meat 

Some birds have very long thin beaks that they use for dipping into flowers or poking into holes in the ground These include hummingbirds bee eaters and avocets Some birds have short beaks but wide mouths that are perfect for catching insects in the air like swallows swifts and nightjars Some birds that eat fruit like toucans and hornbills have beaks which are enormous but are very light in weight The curved beaks of parrots are good for eating large seeds and cracking nuts while birds that peck small seeds and food from the ground have short beaks like pigeons  ImageOstriche3jpgAn Ostrich has very long legs ImagePerupelicanjpgA Pelican has a huge beak ImageDoppelhornvogel 09jpgThe Great Hornbill is a large bird with an unusual beak photo WBerns ImageHummingbirdjpgHummingbirds are among the worlds smallest birds 

Birds come in a huge range of colours These colours can be useful to a bird in two ways The colours can either help to hide the bird or they can help to attract attention to the bird when it is looking for a mate

Many birds are brown green or grey These colours make a bird harder to see they camouflage the bird Brown is the most common colour Brown birds include sparrows emus thrushes larks eagles falcons and the female birds of many species such as wrens ducks blackbirds and peacocks When a brown bird is in long grass or among tree trunks or rocks it is camouflaged Birds that live in long grass often have brown feathers streaked with black which looks like shadows A Bittern is almost invisible in long reeds Other birds including starlings and minahs are quite dark in colour but are flecked with little spots that look like raindrops on leaves 

Many birds from hot countries are green or have some green feathers particularly parrots Birds that live in green trees often have green backs even if they have bright coloured breasts From the back the birds are camouflaged This is very useful when sitting on a nest The birds bright coloured breast is hidden Budgerigiars are bred in different colours such as blue white and mauve but in the wild they are nearly all green and yellow Even though they fly very well they normally spend a lot of time on the ground eating grass seeds Their yellow and black stiped back helps to hide them in the shadows made by long dry grass while their green breasts are a similar colour to the leaves of gum trees

Grey birds include most pigeons and doves cranes storks and herons Grey birds are often rock living birds like pigeons or birds that sit on dead tree trunks looking like a broken branch Water birds like herons often have a pale grey colour which makes it harder for a fish to notice that the bird is standing looking down for something to catch Water birds no matter what colour they are on top are often white underneath so that when a fish looks up the bird looks like part of the sky

Black birds include crows ravens and male blackbirds Some birds that are dark colours spend quite a lot of time on the ground hopping around in the shadows under bushes Among these birds are the male blackbird and the Satin Bowerbird which is not black but very dark blue Crows and ravens often perch high on bare trees in the winter where their black shape against the sky looks like the dark bare branches  ImagePerdix perdixjpgGrey Partridges can hide in grass easily foto Szczepanek ImageAfrican Scops owljpgThis Scops Owl is almost invisible against the tree ImageAustkingparrotjpgThe King Parrot is one of Australias many brightly coloured parrots foto BDonald ImageLuzonbleedingheartdovearpjpgBleeding Heart Dove photo Arpingstone ImageCommonshelduck2arp750pixjpgCommon Shelduck foto Arpingstone ImageAlcedo atthis 2jpgKingfisher foto LLukasik ImageLightmatter flamingo2jpgFlamingo foto ALogan ImageOriole 2jpgGolden Oriole foto Dixi 

Many birds are not camouflaged but stand out because they are pied This means that they are black and white Black and white birds include magpies pied geese pelicans and Australian magpies Pied birds often have brightly coloured beaks and legs of yellow or red The silver pheasant with its long white tail striped with fine bars of black has a brightly coloured face

Some birds are famous for their colour and are named for it such as the Bluebird the Azure Kingfisher the Golden Pheasant the Scarlet Macaw the Violet Wren and the Robin Redbreast

Many other birds are very brightly coloured in countless combinations Some of the most colourful birds are quite common like pheasants peacocks domestic fowl and parrots Colourful small birds include blue tits the gold finches humming birds fairy wrens and bee eaters Some birds like those of the Bird of Paradise in Papua New Guinea have such beautiful feathers that they have been hunted for them 

With some birds such as flamingos the male and the female are both brightly coloured With other species only the male is brightly coloured and uses his colourful feathers to attract females The peacock is the best example of this but also in the domestic fowl the male has long shiny feathers above his tail and also long neck feathers that may be a different colour to his wings and body There are only a very few types of birds where the female is more colourful than the male 

Most birds can fly They do this by pushing through the air with their wings The curved surfaces of the wings cause air currents which lift the bird Flapping keeps the air current moving to create lift and also moves the bird forward 

Some birds can glide on air currents without flapping Many birds use this method when they are about to land Some birds can also hover and remain in one place This method is used by birds of prey such as falcons that are looking for something to eat Seagulls are also good at hovering particularly if there is a strong breeze The most expert hovering birds are tiny hummingbirds which can beat their wings both backwards and forwards and can stay quite still in the air while they dip their long beaks into flowers to feed on the sweet nectar  ImageFlock of tundra swansjpg A Flock of Tundra Swans fly in V formation ImageOspreyNASAjpgThis Osprey at Kennedy Space Centre is hovering ImageWandering AlbatrossjpgA Wandering Albatross can sleep while flying FileCathartes aura 2jpgThe large broad wings of a vulture allow it to soar without flapping FileAustralian barn owljpgThe soft feathers of an owl allow it to fly quietly FileCalifornia Quail with babiesJPGSome birds such as the quail live mainly on the ground FileCasuarius casuarius Brevard Zoo 8ajpgA cassowary cannot fly but can defend itself ImageSchwimmender PinguinjpgPenguins flippers are good for swimming 

Different types of birds have different needs Their wings are adapted to suit the way they fly 

Large birds of prey such as eagles that spend a lot of time soaring on the wind have wings that are large and broad The main flight feathers are long and wide They help the eagle to stay on rising air currents without using much energy while the eagle looks at the ground below to find the next meal When the eagle sees some small creature move it can close its wings and fall from the sky like a missile opening its great wings again to slow down as it comes to land The worlds largest eagle the Philippine Eagle has a wingspan of about 2 metres wide

Birds that live in grassland areas or open forests and feed on fruit insects and reptiles often spend a lot of time flying short journeys looking for food and water They have wings that are shaped in a similar way to eagles but rounder and not as good for soaring These include many Australian birds like Cockatoos

Birds such as geese that migrate from one country to another fly very long distances Their wings are big and strong because the birds are large and they stock up on food for the long flight Migrating water birds usually form family groups of 12 30 birds They fly very high making use of long streams of air that blow from north to south in different seasons They are very well organised often flying in a V pattern The geese at the back do not have to flap so hard they are pulled on by the wind of the ones at the front Every so often they change the leader so that the front bird who does most work and sets the pace can have a rest Geese and swans are the highest flying birds reaching 8000 metres or more when on migration Geese often honk loudly while they are flying It is thought that they do this to support the leader and help the young ones

Birds that fly very quickly such as swifts and swallows have long narrow pointed wings These birds need great speed because they eat insects catching most of them while they are flying These birds also migrate They often collect in huge flocks of thousands of birds that move together like a whirling cloud 

Birds that live in bushes and branches have triangular wings that help the bird change direction Many forest birds are expert at getting up speed by flapping and then gliding steadily among the trees tilting to avoid things as they go Members of the kingfisher family are expert at this type of flying

Birds such as owls that hunt at night have wings with soft rounded feathers so that they do not flap loudly Birds that are awake at night are called nocturnal birds Birds that are awake during the day are diurnal

A Wandering Albatross and Arctic Tern might spend several years without coming to land They can sleep while gliding and have wings which when they are stretched right out look like the wings of a jet plane 

Bird like chickens that feed mainly on the ground and only use their wings to fly to safety have small wings

Some birds do not fly These include running birds like ostriches and emus and ocean living birds the large penguin family 

Ostriches and emus do not need to fly because although they feed and nest on the ground their great size and their speed is their protection Some other ground feeding birds have not been so lucky Some birds such as the Dodo and the Kiwi were ground feeding birds that lived in safety on islands where there was nothing dangerous to eat them They lost the power of flight Kiwis are endangered because European settlement to New Zealand brought animals like cats dogs and rats which kill kiwis and eat their eggs However Kiwis and also the rare New Zealand Ground Parrot have survived In the case of Dodos they were fat and delicious They were killed and eaten by sailors until there was none left Other flightless birds which have disappeared are the Auk and the Moa

Penguins spend a great deal of time at sea where they are in danger from seals On land they usually live in areas where there were few dangers until the arrival of European settlers with dogs and cats Their wings have adapted to life in the sea and have become flippers which help them in swimming very fast

Although birds are warm blooded creatures like mammals they do not give birth to live babies They lay eggs like cold blooded creatures such as lizards Unlike most reptiles the shell of a birds egg is hard The baby bird grows inside the egg and after a few weeks breaks out or hatches 

Birds in cold climates usually have a breeding season once a year in the spring Migratory birds can have two springs and two mating seasons in a year So can birds that live in hot climates 

When the breeding season arrives the birds choose partners Some birds are mated for life like married couples These birds include pigeons geese and cranes Other birds look for new partners each year and sometimes a male bird or cock will have several wives 

For birds that choose new mates part of the breeding season is display The male bird will do all sorts of things to attract females These include singing dancing showing off the feathers and building a beautiful nest Some male birds have splendid feathers for attracting females The most famous is the peacock who can spread the feathers above his tail into a huge fan  ImagePfau imponierendjpgA peacock display  ImageSarusjpgSarus Crane Many cranes make dancing movements to attract their mate ImageEmu GelegejpgEmu nest ImageSperlingGjpgA nest of House Sparrows

Once the birds have found partners they find a suitable place to lay eggs The idea of what is a suitable place differs between species but most build bird nests Robins will make a beautiful little round nest of woven grass and carefully line it with feathers bits of fluff and other soft things Swallows like to nest near other swallows They make nests from little blobs of clay often on a beam near the roof of a building where it is well sheltered Many birds like a hollow tree to nest in Eagles nests are often just piles of dead wood on the top of the tallest tree or mountain Scrub Turkeys scratch together a huge pile of leaves that may be 10 metres across Guillemots lay their eggs on rock shelves with no nest at all Their eggs are shaped so that they roll around in circles A cuckoo does not make its own nest It lays its egg in the nest of another bird and leaves it for them to care for The cuckoo eggs are camouflaged to look like the hosts eggs

When the nest has been prepared the birds mate so that the eggs are fertilised and the chicks will start growing Unlike mammals birds only have one opening as the exit hole for body fluids and for reproduction The opening is called the cloaca A female bird called a hen has two ovaries of which the left one usually produces eggs 

Most male birds have no sex organs that can be seen But inside the male are two testes which produce sperm which is stored in the cloaca Birds mate by rubbing their cloacas together although with some birds particularly large water birds the male has a sort of a penis inside the cloaca

Once the hen has mated she produces fertile eggs which have chicks growing inside them She lays the eggs in the nest There might be just one egg or a number of them called a clutch Emus might lay as many as fifteen huge dark green eggs in a clutch After the eggs are laid they are incubated or kept warm so the chicks form inside One of the good things about the fact that most birds stay together for the whole nesting time is that the work is shared The birds generally take turns sitting on the eggs so that both can feed 

This is not always the case With Emus the male does all the sitting and all the baby minding With Emperor Penguins it is also the male that cares for the egg There is only one egg which he keeps on his feet and under his feathers standing in a big group of males without feeding until the chick is hatched While the eggs are hatching the females are at sea feeding so that they can care for the chicks when they return 

With birds that build mounds the heat to hatch the eggs comes from the sun on the rotten leaves The parents leave the mound When the chicks hatch they are strong enough to feed themselves 

Many types of birds take 2 4 weeks to hatch eggs Albatrosses take 80 days During this time the female loses a lot of her body weight 

The quickest hatching time is for the Cuckoo Some types of cuckoos take only 10 days This means that when they hatch in the nest of their foster parents the eggs that the parents have laid are not yet ready Newborn cuckoos are naked blind and ugly but they are very strong They get under any eggs that are in the nest and throw them out before they hatch That means that the cuckoo has the whole care of both parents Baby cuckoos grow fast and are often soon bigger than the parents who feed them 

When baby birds hatch in most types of birds they are fed by both parents and sometimes by older aunties as well Their mouths are open all the time and are often very brightly coloured so the parents can easily see where to put the food For birds that eat grain and fruit the parents eat and partly digest the food for the babies It is then vomitted carefully into the babies mouth   ImageHausrotschwanz Brutpflege 2006 05 24 211jpgA Black Redstart feeding chicks photo Stefan Xp ImageCygnusatratus adultwithchicksinAustralia 8jpgBlack Swan and cygnets CC ImageReed warbler cuckoojpgA Reed Warbler feeding a baby Cuckoo photo Ravenloft ImageYellow crested CockatoojpgTwo Sulphur Crested Cockatoos from a big flock are on the lookout photo Prazak 

Many birds particularly those that mate for life are very sociable and keep together in a family group which might be anything from 4 or 6 adult birds and their young to a very large flock 

As chicks grow they change the fluffy down that covers them as babies for real feathers At this stage they are called fledglings Other family members may help care for fledgling chicks feeding them and protecting them from attack while parents are feeding When the fledglings have their new feathers they come out of the nest to learn to fly In some types of birds like pigeons the parents watch over this and as the young ones get stronger will give them flying lessons teaching them how to glide how to fly in spirals and how to land like an expert

Flocks of birds can be very highly organised in a way that takes care of all the flock members Studies of small flocking birds like tree sparrows show that they clearly communicate with each other as sometimes thousands of birds may fly in close formation and spiral patterns without colliding 

Two common behaviours in flocking birds are guarding and reconnaissance When a flock of birds is feeding it is common for one bird to perch on a high place to keep guard over the flock In the same way when a flock is asleep often one bird will remain awake It is also common for large flocks to send one or two birds ahead of them when they are flying to a new area The look out birds can spy the lie of the land to find food water and good places to perch 

All birds make sounds to communicate The types of noises that they make are different All birds have cries which are the sounds to communicate Some birds can also sing These birds are called songbirds Some songbirds are robins larks canaries thrushes nightingales and crows Birds that are not songbirds are pigeons seagulls eagles owls and ducks Parrots are not songbirds even though they can be taught to sing human songs  ImageErithacus rubeculajpgA favorite songbird the European Robin photo MSzczepanek ImageRooster02jpgThe crow of the rooster is a familiar bird call ImageCurrawong in peppercornjpgThe Pied Currawong an oustanding singer ImageJackdawnorthdevonarp sh750pixjpgThe Jackdaws helped Lorenz to understand bird communication photo Arpingstone 

The Austrian naturalist Konrad Lorenz studied the way in which birds communicate or talk to each other He found that each type of bird had a number of sounds which they made automatically when ever they felt a certain way Every sound had an action that went with it So if the bird was frightened it acted frightened and made a frightened sound This told the other birds around it that something frightening was happening 

If a flock of birds were flying over a field they would be calling Fly Fly But a hungry bird seeing something good to eat down below might start calling Food Food If other birds were also hungry they would make the same call until more birds were calling Food Food than Fly Fly At this point the mind of the flock would be changed Some of the birds would start to yell Fly downwards Fly downwards as they sank from the sky until the whole flock was all noisily calling the same thing 

These communication sounds are often short hard sounds like chirps squeaks squawks and twitters Sometimes the calls are longer and more musical They include the Rookety coo sound of a pigeon and the Cockadoodledoo of a rooster The bird cannot change these sounds They always make them in the same way The bird is locked into making each sound every time a particular idea comes into its head

When a bird sings it can chose what it sings and it can change its song Most singing birds that are kept as pets like canaries have several tunes and some variations Songbirds in the wild can learn songs from each other The same species of bird will sing different songs in different regions 

A good example of this is the Currawong This is an Australia bird which is like a black and white crow In the autumn families get together in large flocks and do a lot of singing Currawongs from some areas sing much more complex songs than others Generally Currawongs from the Blue Mountains are the finest singers 

The song of the Currawong can be sung as a solo but is often performed as a choir One bird will take the lead and sing Warble warble warble warble All the other birds will join in and sing Wooooooo When all the birds know the song the choir will sing the Warble part and the soloist will sing the Woo The song changes from year to year and from place to place 

Konrad Lorenz noticed that when birds sing they often use a lot of their regular calls as part of the song Lorenz had a flock of Jackdaws which were scattered during World War II One day an old bird returned For many months she sat on the chimney singing her song but in the song she kept making the call which Lorenz knew meant Come home Come home One day to the great surprise of Lorenz a male bird flew from a passing flock and joined her on the chimney Lorenz was sure that it was her long lost husband who had found his way home at last

Birds are classified by taxonomists as Aves The Aves are descended from carnivorous dinosaurs called Therapods Birds are the only living descendants of dinosaurs Birds and Crocodilia are the only living members of the Archosaur reptiles 

The class Aves is now defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx lithographica

Archaeopteryx from the Upper Jurassic is the earliest known type of bird It is famous because it was one of the first important fossils found after Charles Darwin published his ideas about evolution in the 19th century Today it is the oldest bird we know Some biologists think that Archaeopteryx could not fly very well Other early fossil birds are for example Confuciusornis Anchiornis huxlei Microraptor and other Paraves 

Many fossils of early birds and small dinosaurs have been discovered in the Liaoning Province of Northeast China The fossils show that small theropod dinosaurs had feathers These deposits have preserved them so well that the impressions of their feathers can be clearly seen 

This leads us to think that feathers evolved first as heat insulation and only later for flight The origin of birds lies in these small feathered dinosaurs 

Palaeontologists now agree that birds evolved from Maniraptora group of dinosaurs This explains why some consider birds to be living dinosaurs

Birds are an important thing for people to eat The sort of birds that people eat most often is the chicken and its eggs but people often also eat geese pheasants turkeys and ducks Other birds are sometimes eaten are emus ostriches pigeons grouse quails doves woodcocks songbirds and others

At one time swans and flamingos were special food for the rich and powerful like some Emperors of Rome but people are usually not allowed to eat them now

Many species have all died because they have been hunted for food for example the Passenger Pigeon Many others are in danger or dead because people have taken away the places where they lived for wood or farms

Many species have learned how to get food from people The number of birds of these species has grown because of it Seagulls and crows find food from garbage dumps The common pigeon House Sparrows Passer domesticus and Common Starlings live in large numbers in towns and cities all over the world

Sometimes people also use birds For example homing pigeons carry messages Nowadays people sometimes race them for sport People also use falcons for hunting and cormorants for fishing Scientists often use chickens and pigeons to help find answers to their questions In the past people in mines often used a Canary to see if there were bad gases in the air

People often have colorful birds such as parrots and mynahs as pets Some of these birds are popular because they can copy human talking Because of this some people trap birds and take them to other countries to sell This is not usually allowed Most pet birds are specially bred and are sold in pet shops 

People can catch some bird diseases for example psittacosis salmonellosis campylobacteriosis Newcastles disease mycobacteriosis influenza giardiasis and cryptosporiadiosis In 2005 there is an epidemic of bird influenza spreading through some parts of the world often called avian flu

Some people have birdboxes in their gardens to give birds a place to nest and bird tables where birds can get food and water in very cold or very dry weather

Freedom of speech is the right to state ones opinions and ideas without being stopped or punished Sometimes this is also called Freedom of expression Freedom of speech is thought to also include Freedom of information However new laws are usually needed to allow information to be used easily

Most people think freedom of speech is necessary for a democratic government In countries without free speech people might be afraid to say what they think Then the government does not know what the people want If it does not know what they want it cannot respond to their wants Without free speech the government does not have to worry as much about doing what the people want Some people say this is why some governments do not allow free speech they do not want to be criticised or they fear there would be revolution if everyone knew everything that was happening in the country

A well known liberal thinker John Stuart Mill believed that freedom of speech is not as important because everyone should have a right to express him or herself but because the society they live in should have a right to hear that persons ideas

Banana is the common name for a type of herb and also the name for the herbaceous plants that grow this herb These plants belong to the genus Musa They are native to the tropical region of Southeast Asia There are about 100 different species of bananas

It is possible that bananas were grown for food for the first time in Papua New Guinea Today they are cultivated in the tropical regions around the world

Most banana plants are grown for their herbs but some are grown as ornamental plants or to provide fibre In parts of Africa beer has been made by fermenting the juice of certain cultivars known as beer bananas The ash of banana can be used to make soap In Asia bananas are often planted to provide shade to plants that love it for example coffee cocoa nutmeg or black pepper That way banana plants can often be found in plantations of other crops 

The bananas from a group of cultivars with firmer starchier fruit are called plantains Plantains are mostly used for cooking or fibre The bananas that are used for desserts are called dessert bananas

The banana plant is the largest herbaceous flowering plant Banana plants are often mistaken to be trees Bananas have a false stem which is made by the lower part of the leaves This pseudostem can grow to be two to eight metres tall Each pseudostem grows from a corm A pseudostem is able to produce a single bunch of bananas After fruiting the pseudostem dies and is replaced When most bananas are ripe they turn yellow or sometimes red

Leaves are arranged as a spiral and may grow convert27mftabbroff long and convert60cmftabbron wide They are easily torn by the wind which results in the familiar look

The banana fruit grow in hanging clusters There are up to 20 fruit to a broken wikt linktiernoun 2tier The total of the hanging clusters is known as a bunch or commercially as a banana stem There are between three and twenty tiers to a bunch A bunch usually weighs between thirty and fifty kilograms

A single fruit is about 125 grams on average about three quarters of this is water 

Each banana has a protective outer layer There is a fleshy part inside Both the skin and inner part can be eaten Western cultures generally eat the inside raw and throw away the skin while some Asian cultures generally eat both the skin and inside cooked Each fruit has many strings that run between the skin and the inner part 

Bananas have a lot of vitamin B6 vitamin C and potassium

Bananas are grown in at least 107 countries In popular culture and commerce banana usually refers to soft sweet dessert bananas The bananas from a group of cultivars with firmer starchier fruit are called plantains Bananas may also be cut and dried and eaten as a type of chip Dried bananas are also ground into banana flour

The banana species growing in the wild have fruits with many hard large seeds Almost all bananas grown to be eaten have seedless fruits Bananas are classified either as dessert bananas or as green cooking bananas Almost all export bananas are of the dessert types Only about ten to fifteen percent of all production is for export Dessert bananas change their color and usually turn yellow when they are ripe plantains and bananas generally used for cooking stay green Certain bananas have other colors when ripe

The countries that produce the most bananas include India Brazil China Ecuador and the Philippines The top five countries that exported bananas were Ecuador Costa Rica the Philippines Colombia and Guatemala The United States the European Union and Japan are the biggest buyers of banana Bananas are among the most valuable agricultural export products They provided about sixty percent of export earnings of Saint Lucia and about twelve percent of the Gross Domestic Product of the country between 1994 and 1996

Some people are allergic to bananas There are two basic forms of these allergies The first is known as oral allergy syndrome Within an hour of eating a banana swelling starts inside the mouth or throat This allergy is related to allergies caused by pollen like that of the birch tree The other is similar to latex allergies It causes urticaria and potentially serious upper gastrointestinal symptoms

The fibre gained from the banana plant has been used to make textiles for a long time In Japan bananas have been grown to be used for clothing and in the house since at least the 13th century With the Japanese system the leaves and shoots are cut from the plant periodically to make sure they are soft The harvested shoots must first be boiled in lye to prepare the fibres for the making of the yarn These banana shoots produce fibres of varying degrees of softness They can be used for yarns and textiles of different qualties and for specific uses For example the outermost fibres of the shoots are the coarsest  they are good for tablecloths The softest innermost fibres are desirable for kimono and kamishimo This traditional Japanese banana cloth making process has many steps all performed by hand

Another system is used in Nepal There the trunk of the banana plant is harvested instead Small pieces of this trunk are then softened The fibres are extracted mechanically they are bleached and dried They are then sent to the Kathmandu Valley were high end rugs are produced These rugs have a texture and general qualities similar to that of silk These banana fibre rugs are woven by the traditional Nepalese hand knotted methods

Banana fibre is also used to make banana paper There are two different kinds of banana paper That made from the bark which is mainly used for art Paper can also be made from the fibre and from unused fruits This is an industrial process

BielBienne is an industrial town in Switzerland It is in the part of Switzerland named Bern and near the city also named Bern The town is known for many companies that make watches and machines 

For many hundreds of years the town was run by another place named Basel It tried to join with other cities in Switzerland But it was not allowed to join the Swiss Confederation until 1815 Biel is home to a firm named Swatch which makes watches sold around the world In 1998 Swatch announced that Biel would be the center of a new way of measuring time Biel Mean Time was created as a way to advertise that Swatch was a modern firm with new ideas

About 57 of the people in Biel speak German as their mother tongue The remaining 43 speak French as their mother tongue That is why the city has two names

Swatch Internet Time is a way to measure time invented in 1998 by the Swatch manufacturing firm in BielBienne Switzerland Time is shown as an mark with three numerals The day starts with 000 for midnight Noon is 500 Just before midnight is 999 The thousand parts which make up a day are called dot beats Each dot beat is one minute and 264 seconds long Midnight is the same as Central European Winter Timeand Internet Time is the same all over the world It does not change during the Summer People can use it to plan phone calls or Internet meetings Most types of Linux can show Internet Time as the desktop clock

A test tube is a kind of laboratory glassware composed of a fingerlike length of glass tubing open at the top usually with a rounded lip at the top and a rounded U shaped bottom

They range in size from a couple inches to several inches long from a few millimeters to a couple centimeters in diameter They are designed to allow easy heating of samples to be held in a flame and often are made of expansion resistant glasses such as borosilicate glass

Tests tubes are often preferred above beakers when multiple small chemical or biological samples have to be handled andor stored

Vacutainers are a type of test tube that can be used for both collection and storage of blood

A beaker is a kind of laboratory glassware A beaker is a cylinder with a lip and a spout A beaker is usually about the same width as its height This makes beakers very stable and easy to handle They may be made of plastic glass or borosilicate glass Some beakers have marks on them to show about how much volume of liquid they hold  these can not be used for exact measurements

Beakers are often used to make solutions and they are probably the most used piece of laboratory glassware 

In chemistry a crucible is a kind of laboratory equipment that is usually a cup made of porcelain or non reactive metal used to heat chemical compounds to very high temperatures using a bunsen burner One of the earliest uses of platinum was as a material in crucibles Metals such as nickel and zirconium are also used as crucible materials these days

Reference

Lithium is the third chemical element in the periodic table This means that it has 3 protons in its nucleus and 3 electrons around it Its atomic number is 3 Its mass number is 694 It has two common isotopes 6Li and 7Li 7Li is more common 925 of lithium is 7Li Lithium is a soft silvery metal that is very reactive It is used in lithium batteries and certain medicines 

Lithium is one of the alkali metals Lithium is a silvery solid metal It is very soft Thus it can be cut easily with a knife It melts at a low temperature It is very light similar to wood It is the least dense metal and the least dense element in a solid or liquid state It can hold more heat than any other solid element It conducts heat and electricity easily 

It will react with water giving off hydrogen to form a basic solution Because of this lithium must be stored in petroleum jelly Sodium and potassium can be stored in oil but lithium cannot because it is so light It will just float on the oil and not be protected by it 

Lithium also reacts with halogens It can react with nitrogen gas to make lithium nitride It reacts with air to make a black tarnish and then a white powder of lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate

Lithium forms chemical compounds with only one oxidation state 1 Most of them are white and unreactive They make a bright red color when heated in a flame They are a little toxic Most of them dissolve in water Lithium carbonate is less soluble in water than the other alkali metal carbonates like sodium carbonate

 FileLithium nitratejpgLithium nitrate FileLithium hydroxidejpgLithium hydroxide FileLithium carbonatejpgLithium carbonate FileLithium chloridejpgLithium chloride 

It does not occur as an element in nature It only is in the form of lithium compounds The ocean has a large amount of lithium in it Certain granites have large amounts of lithium Most living things have lithium in them There are some places where much lithium is in the salt Some silicates have lithium in them

Lithium was discovered by Johann Arfvedson in 1817 In 1818 Christian Gmelin observed that lithium salts give a bright red color in flame WT Brande and Sir Humphrey Davy later used electrolysis on lithium oxide to isolate the element Lithium was used first in greases Then nuclear weapons became a big use of lithium Lithium was also used to make glass melt easier and make aluminium oxide melt easier in making aluminium Now lithium is used mainly in batteries

It was apparently given the name lithium because it was discovered from a mineral while other common alkali metals were first discovered in plant tissue

It is made by getting lithium chloride from pools and springs The lithium chloride is melted and electrolyzed This makes liquid lithium and chlorine

Its main use is in batteries Lithium is used as an anode in the lithium battery It has more power than batteries with zinc like alkaline cells Lithium ion batteries also have lithium in them though not as an element It is also used in heat transfer alloys Lithium is used to make organolithium compounds They are used for very strong bases 

Lithium compounds are used in some drugs known as mood stabilizers Lithium niobate is used in radio transmitters in cell phones Some lithium compounds are also used in ceramics Lithium chloride can absorb water from other things Some lithium compounds are used to make soap and grease

Lithium reacts with water making irritating smoke and heat It is not as dangerous as the other alkali metals Lithium hydroxide is very corrosive

There are 5 isotopes of Lithium having respectively 2 3 4 5 and 6 neutrons in the nucleus The most common isotope in nature is 3Li7 which makes up 9258 of the total The second isotope which is widely available is 3Li6 which makes up 742 of the total The other 3 isotopes exist in very small quantities The atomic mass of Lithium is 6939

Beryllium is an alkaline earth metal It is grayish in color It has an atomic number of 4 and is symbolized by the letters Be It is toxic and should not be handled by anyone without proper training

Berylliums atomic structure consists of 4 electrons 4 protons and 5 neutrons

Beryllium is most likely known for the chemical compounds it forms Some of these are emeralds and aquamarines

Beryllium has one of the highest melting points of the light metals

Data compression is a set of steps for packing data into a smaller space while allowing for the original data to be seen again Compression is a two way process a compression algorithm can be used to make a data package smaller but it can also be run the other way to decompress the package into its original form Data compression is useful in computing to save disk space or to reduce the bandwidth used when sending data 

Lossless compression packs data in such a way that the compressed package can be decompressed and the data can be pulled out exactly the same as it went in This is very important for computer programs and archives since even a very small change in a computer program will make it unusable

This type of compression works by reducing how much waste space is in a piece of data For example if you receive a data package which contains AAAAABBBB you could compress that into 5A4B which has the same meaning but takes up less space This type of compression is called run length encoding because you define how long the run of a character is In the above example there are two runs a run of 5 As and another of 4 Bs

The problem with run length encoding is that it only works on long pieces of the same value of data If you receive a package with ABBAABAAB inside that can be compressed into 1A2B2A1B2A1B but thats longer than the original In this case theres another method that can be used checking how often a particular value comes up in the whole data package This is often called frequency compression

The most common kind of frequency compression is called Huffman coding after the scientist who came up with the idea The basic plan is to give each distinct value in a piece of data a code values that crop up all the time get shorter codes and values that only show up once or twice get longer codes

For some types of data lossy compression can go a lot further this is most often the case with media files like music and images Beyond a certain level of fine grain detail or past a particularly high tone people do not notice if the information is missing As a result it can simply be removed from the data

Of course this will not work for computer programs and other such data where every piece is important throwing away large pieces of a computer program is generally unhealthy for the program

A compiler is a program that takes source code and translates it into a more basic language These simpler languages are either assembly language or machine code The action of translating the high level programming language code is called compiling Code that has been simplified is called compiled code

For many programmers using a compiler is easier than writing the machine code themselves because there are many different machine codes For example the GNU C Compiler compiles C into machine code

As shown in the diagram the source code of a computer program is read by a lexical analyzer which splits the text into words and symbols known as tokens The tokens are analyzed by a parser which looks for grammatical patterns in the use of the tokens The parser collects the language data for an intermediate code generator to convert the data into that form of coding An optimizer reads the intermediate code which was generated from the parser data and simplifies or omits extra code to write a more efficient language text which is then changed into the target computers machine code

At the end of each compilation step the partial finished product could be stored and then only processed later on A language like Java uses this successfully where they lack the final translation step to instructions the processor understands They only do the final translation step once the Java program is running on a computer This is either called interpreting or JITting depending on the used technique

For example the source code might contain an equation such as x 510 6 1 The lexical analyzer would separate each number and symbol into separate tokens The parser would note the pattern of tokens as being an equation The intermediate code generator would write a form of coding which defines a storage variable named x and assigns the numerical product of 510 plus 6 and 1 The optimizer would simplify the calculation of 51061 as being just 57 Hence the target machine code generator would set a variable named x and put the value 57 into that storage place in the computers memory using the instructions of whichever computer chip is being used

The eye is an organ for sensing light so people may see About 97 percent of animals have eyes Image resolving eyes are present in cnidaria molluscs chordates annelids and arthropods 

The evolution of eyes started with simplest light sensitive patches in unicellular organisms These eye spots do nothing but detect if the surroundings are light or dark Most animals have a biochemical clock inside 

These simple eye spots are used to adjust this daily clock which is called circadian rhythm Some snails for example see no image at all but they sense light which helps them stay out of bright sunlight 

More complex eyes have not lost this function A special type of cells in the eye senses light for a different purpose than seeing These cells are called ganglion cells They are located in the retina They send their information about light to the brain along a different path This information adjusts the animals circadian rhythm to natures lightdark cycle of 24 hours The system also works for some blind people who cannot see light at all 

Eyes that are a little bit better are shaped like cups which lets the animal know where the light is coming from

More complex eyes give the full sense of vision including color motion and texture These eyes have a round shape that makes light rays focus on the back part of the eye called the retina 

In mammals two kinds of cells rods and cones allow sight by sending signals through the optic nerve to the brain 

Some animals can see light that humans can not see They can see ultraviolet or infrared light

The lens on the front part of the eye is acts like a camera lens It can be pulled flatter by muscles inside the eye or allowed to become rounder As some people get older they may not be as able to do this perfectly Many people are born with other small problems or get them later in life and they may need eyeglasses to fix the problem

Today ten different types of eyes are known Most ways of capturing an image have evolved at least once 

One way to categorize eyes is to look at the number of chambers Simple eyes are made of only one concave chamber perhaps with a lens Compound eyes have many such chambers with their lenses on a convex surface

Eyes also can be grouped according to how the photoreceptor is made Photoreceptors are either cillated or rhabdomic and some annelids possess both

is the most simples eye It means you only have one eye

Pit eyes are set in a depression in the skin This reduces the angles at which light can enter It allows the organism to say where the light is coming from

Such eyes can be found in about 85 of phyla They probably came before the development of more complex eyes Pit eyes are small They are made of up to about hundred cells covering about 100 m The directionality can be improved by reducing the size of the opening and by putting a reflective layer behind the receptor cells

The pinhole eye is an advanced form of pit eye It has several improvements most notably a small aperture and deep pit Sometimes the aperture can be changed It is only found in the Nautilus Without a lens to focus the image it produces a blurry image Consequently nautiloids can not discriminate between objects with a separation of less than 11 Shrinking the aperture would produce a sharper image but let in less light

The resolution of pit eyes can be improved a lot by adding a material to make a lens This will reduce the radius of the blurring and increase the resolution that can be achieved The most basic form can still be seen in some gastropods and annelids These eyes have a lens of one refractive index It is possible to get a better image with materials that have a high refractive index which decreases towards the edges This decreases the focal length and allows a sharp image to form on the retina

This eye creates an image that is sharp enough that motion of the eye can cause significant blurring To minimize the effect of eye motion while the animal moves most such eyes have stabilizing eye muscles

The ocelli of insects have a simple lens but their focal point always lies behind the retinaThey can never form a sharp image This limits the function of the eye Ocelli blur the image across the whole retina They are very good at responding to rapid changes in light intensity across the whole visual field this fast response is accelerated even more by the large nerve bundles which rush the information to the brain Focusing the image would also cause the suns image to be focused on a few receptors These could possibly be damaged by the intense light shielding the receptors would block out some light and reduce their sensitivity

This fast response has led to suggestions that the ocelli of insects are used mainly in flight because they can be used to detect sudden changes in which way is up

The eyes of most land living vertebrates contain a fluid that has a higher refractive index than the air That way the lens does not have to reduce the focal length because this is done by the fluid That way the lens can adjust the focus more easily That way a very high resolution can be obtained

Instead of using a lens it is also possible to have cells inside the eye that act like mirrors The image can then be reflected to focus at a central point This design also means that someone looking into such an eye will see the same image as the organism which has them

Many small organisms such as rotifers copeopods and platyhelminthes use such this design but their eyes are too small to produce usable images Some larger organisms such as scallops also use reflector eyes The scallop Pecten has up to 100 millimeter scale reflector eyes fringing the edge of its shell It detects moving objects as they pass successive lenses

Compound eyes are different from simple eyes Instead of having one organ that can sense light they put together many such organs Some compound eyes have thousands of them The resulting image is put together in the brain based on the signals of the many eye units Each such unit is called ommatidium several are called ommatidia The ommatidia are located on a convex surface each of them points in a slighly different direction Unlike simple eyes compound eyes have a very large angle of view They can detect fast movement and sometimes the polarization of light 

Compound eyes are common in arthropods annelids and some bivalved molluscs

Good fliers like flies or honey bees or prey catching insects like praying mantis or dragonflies have specialized zones of ommatidia organized into a fovea area which gives sharp vision In this zone the eyes are flattened and the facets are larger The flattening allows more ommatidia to receive light from a spot This gives a higher resolution

The body of Ophiocoma wendtii a type of brittle star is covered with ommatidia turning its whole skin into a compound eye The same is true of many chitons

Insects are a class in the phylum Arthropoda They are small terrestrial invertebrates which have a hard exoskeleton 

Insects are the largest group of animals on earth by far about 926400 different species have been described Estimates of the total number of species range from 2 million to 30 million 

New species of insects are continually being found there are more insects than all other kinds of animals

Insects have six legs and most have wings Insects were the first animals capable of flight 

As they develop from eggs insects undergo metamorphosis Insects live all over the planet almost all are terrestrial Few insects live in the oceans or in very cold places such as Antarctica The most species live in tropical areas

Some people call all insects bugs but this is not correct Only some insects are true bugs which is a particular order of insects People who study insects are called entomologists

FileInsect anatomy diagramsvgright250pxthumbInsect anatomy 

A Head B Thorax C Abdomen 

 Insects have exoskeletons Their skeletons are made out of thin hard pieces or plates like armour made of chitin All together these pieces make a hard layer around the insects body The exoskeleton protects the insect 

The body of an insect has three main parts a head a thorax and an abdomen On the head are an insects compound eyes its two antennae and its mouth 

On the thorax insects have wings and legs All insects have six legs and usually four wings 

The abdomen is the back part of the insect Inside the abdomen is the stomach the heart and the excretory system where body wastes pass out of the insect Bees also have a stinger at the back of the abdomen

Just like our muscles connect to our bones to make us walk and stand up the muscles of an insect connect to the exoskeleton to make it walk and move Their muscles are on the inside of their skeleton

Insects are cold blooded which means that they can not control their body temperature This means that insects are not good at surviving the cold at any rate out in the open In the winter many insects go into something called diapause which is the insect version of hibernation Some insects like cockroaches cannot go into diapause and they will die if it gets too cold outside This is why cockroaches love living in peoples warm houses

Insects start life as an egg Usually a female insect lays eggs but a few species have live birth The eggs are small but they can usually be seen with the naked eye 

Although the adults are larger they do need a magnifying glass or a binocular microscope to see the details A professional entomologist uses a binocular microscope to identify insects plus a printed reference work There are far too many insects for anyone to remember them all and most entomologists specialise in just one or two orders

After the eggs hatch two kinds of development may occur Some insects have what is called incomplete metamorphosis This means that a small insect called a nymph comes out of the egg and the nymph looks almost the same as the adult insect As the nymph grows it does not change the way it looks but only how big it is It goes through a number of stages called instars Grasshoppers grow in this way

Other insects have complete metamorphosis which means that the small larva which comes out of the egg looks very different from the adult insect Insects that have complete metamorphosis usually come out of the egg as a larva which usually looks like a worm The larva eats food and gets bigger until it turns into a pupa Butterfly pupae are often inside cocoons Inside the cocoon the insect changes the way it looks and often grows wings When the cocoon opens the adult insect comes out Many insects have complete metamorphosis for example beetles butterflies and moths and flies The adult stage of development is called the imago

The oldest known insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha from the 396 million year old Rhynie chert It may have superficially resembled a modern day silverfish insect This species already possessed mandibles of a type associated with winged insects suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time Thus the first insects probably appeared earlier in the Silurian period

In 2008 researchers uncovered what they believe is the worlds oldest known full body impression of a primitive flying insect a 300 million year old specimen from the Carboniferous period

The origins of insect flight remain obscure since the earliest winged insects currently known appear to have been capable fliers Some extinct insects had an additional pair of winglets attaching to the first segment of the thorax for a total of three pairs It seems the insects were not a particularly successful group of animals before they evolved wings

Upper Carboniferous and Lower Permian insect orders include both living groups and a number of Paleozoic groups now extinct During this era some giant dragonfly like forms reached wingspans of convert55to70cminabbron making them far larger than any living insect 

This gigantism may have been due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels which allowed increased respiratory efficiency The lack of flying vertebrates could have been another factor Many of the early groups became extinct during the Permian Triassic extinction event the largest mass extinction in the history of the Earth around 252 million years ago

Different kinds of insects can be divided into groups called orders There are many insect orders The biggest insect orders are listed below

Contrary to what some people believe spiders scorpions and similar animals are not insects they are arachnids Arachnids are arthropods that have 4 pairs of legs Centipedes are arthropods with many legs and are also not insects

This taxonomy lists some of the better known groups of insects

Pests can be harmful to people in different ways Some are parasites such as lice and bed bugs Some of these parasite insects can spread diseases such as mosquitoes spreading malaria 

Other pest insects do not directly hurt people Termites and some beetles eat wood and sometimes eat buildings such as houses However termites also help break down the trees and branches that fall on the forest floor Many insects eat agricultural products Grasshoppers are one example of pest insects that eat plants in agriculture

Some insects are useful to us Bees make honey The larvae of some moths make silk which people use to make clothing In some parts of the world people actually eat insects Eating insects for food is called entomophagy

Many bees and flies pollinate plants This means the insects help the plants make seeds by moving pollen from one flower to another Some good insects eat pest insects such as lady beetles eating aphids Many insects eat dead plants and animals 

People often use poisons called insecticides to kill pest insects Insecticides do not always work Sometimes the pest insects become resistant to the insecticides which means the insecticides do not hurt them anymore Both the Colorado potato beetle and the diamondback moth are insects that are resistant to many insecticides 

Insecticides do not only kill pest insects sometimes many helpful insects are killed too When helpful insects are killed such as those that eat pest insects the pest insects may come back in larger numbers than before because they are not being eaten by helpful insects anymore

Computer jargon means words to do with computers and surrounding topics Knowing what these words mean can help you know more about computers Most people use these words to discuss computer ideas but some people use these words to impress others

Examples of jargon

One million or one thousand thousand is the natural number following 999999 and preceding 1000001 The name is derived from Italian where mille was 1000 and 1000000 became milione a large thousand

In scientific notation it is written as 1106 or just 106 Physical quantities can also be expressed using the SI prefix mega when dealing with SI units For example 1 megawatt equals 1000000 watts

The word million is common to the short scale and long scale numbering systems unlike the larger numbers which have different names in the two systems

The million is sometimes used in the English language as a metaphor for a very large number as in Never in a million years and Youre one in a million or a hyperbole as in Ive walked a million miles

Il Milione is the title of Marco Polos narration of his travel to China The name is supposed to come from Polos nickname after his tales of riches and multitudes

A thousand is the natural number after 999 and before 1001 One thousand thousands is known as a million

In Roman numerals 1000 is written as M

In economics the gross domestic product is how much a place produces in some amount of time For nations the GDP can be calculated by adding up its output inside the borders of that country To know the GDP of a country one would need to add up the consumer spending investment spending government spending and the value of the exports and subtract the value of the imports

This measure is often used to find out the health of a country in an economic way In other words a country with a high value of GDP can be called a large economy

This measure is different from gross national product in that GNP GDP net income from assets abroad

While nominal GDP is the total amount of money spent on GDP real GDP tries to correct this number for inflation For example if the price level rises by 2 and the nominal GDP grows by 5 the real GDP is still only 3

Cricket is a sport It is played between two teams of eleven players each who score runs by running between two sets of three small wooden posts called wickets Each of the wickets is at one end of a rectangle of flattened grass called the pitch Around the pitch is a much larger oval of grass called the cricket ground

There are two teams The team bowling has 11 players on the field The team batting always has two players on the field 

The Captain of the bowling team chooses a bowler from his team the other 10 players are called fielders The bowler is trying to aim the ball at a wicket which is made up of three sticks stuck into the earth with two small sticks balanced on them One of the fielders called the wicket keeper stands behind the wicket to catch the ball if the bowler misses the wicket The other fielders chase the ball after the batsman has hit it 

The bowler runs towards his wicket and bowls towards the batsman at the other wicket He does not throw the ball He bowls the ball overarm with a straight arm An over is six balls meaning he bowls six times Then another player becomes the bowler for the next over and bowls from the other end and so on The same bowler cannot bowl two overs one after the other

The batsman is trying to defend the wicket from getting hit with the ball He does this with a bat When he hits the ball with his bat he may run toward the other wicket To score a run the two batsmen must both run from their wicket to the other wicket as many times as they can If the ball leaves the field after being hit without bouncing six runs are scored If the ball rolls or bounces out whether or not the batter hit it it counts as four runs 

There are different ways that a batsman can get out The most common ways are

When a batsman is out another comes onto the field to take his place The innings is over when ten wickets are taken

In a one day game each side has one innings and innings are limited to a certain number of overs In longer formats each side has two innings and there is no specific limit to the number of overs in an innings

Cricket is popular in many countries mostly in Commonwealth countries

The countries where cricket is most popular compete in international matches that last up to 5 days which are called test matches Those countries are England Australia West Indies South Africa New Zealand India Pakistan Bangladesh and Sri Lanka West Indies are a group of Caribbean countries that play together as a team Several other countries have more junior status The test match idea was invented by teams from England and Australia in the 19th century

Cricket is also played in Kenya Canada Bermuda Ireland Scotland Holland the national teams of those countries can play one day international matches but do not play test matches Zimbabwe does not play international cricket at present Pakistan is not able to play international cricket at home at present

Test matches are the top international matches played between countries The countries permitted to play test matches are accredited by the ICC the International Cricket Council The nine countries are listed above with West Indies counting for this purpose as a country Tests last for five days

Called counties in England and states in Australia and islands in the West Indies These are three or four day matches

In these games the length is determined by the number of overs and each side has one innings only A special formula known as the DuckworthLewis method is applied if rain reduces the time for play It calculates the target score for the team batting second in a limited overs match interrupted by weather or other circumstance

Usually restricted to 50 overs batting for each side 

20 overs for each side

In cricket there are two special kinds of average used to measure how good a player is

There is a separate set of averages for each type of cricket listed above

Track and field is part of the sport of athletics Athletics is a collection of sport events that includes running jumping and throwing Track and field events take place in a sports stadium either on the running track or on the field inside the running track Other athletics events that are not track and field include cross country running road running marathon running and race walking  these events take place outside a sports stadium

Athletics is a very common sporting event over the world Athletics is a combination of different sports generally running jumping and throwing events Running events include marathons hurdle races long distance and short distance events Some jumping events are high jump long jump triple jump and pole vault Throwing events involve javelin throw discus throw hammer throw and shot put

There are also events that combine parts of running jumping and throwing One of these is the decathlon which includes two short distance races a mile run a hurdles race javelin discus shot put high jump and pole vault

All participants are timed or have a distance measured and this is their end result Participants train hard for an event and always aim to better their results

Athletics is a sport that people take part in all over the world It is a sport that is most common between young children up to younger adults Athletics can be played for enjoyment but it can also be a competitive sport Athletics is also an event in the Olympic games

Badminton is a sport for two or four people In this way either the game consists of one player against one player or a team of two players against another team of two players Players use racquets to hit a shuttlecock over a net

The aim of the game is to hit the shuttlecock over the net in a way that the other player or pair cannot hit it back before it hits the floor Also the aim is for the shuttlecock not to land outside the court Every time this is done the player or pair gets one point if they were serving If the other team was serving the first team gets to serve The first player or pair to reach 21 points wins a game 

The winner of the match is the first to win 2 sets 

In both singles and doubles there is a change of service when the server loses a point In doubles the first team to serve has one player serve All other times both players on the team serve 

Badminton was invented by British soldiers in Pune India in the 19th century As the city of Pune was formerly known as Poona the game was also called Poona then

Chemical warfare means using chemical compounds and agents in war to cause injury or death The chemicals used are not explosive but they are poisonous The chemicals are also not made from living beings or organic matter The main types of agents used in chemical warfare are 

If we use chemicals to destroy plants sometimes human beings may be affected by side effects But we will not call it chemical warfare Chemical warfare covers only direct attacks on human life

Poison gas was first used in World War One France was the first country to make this type of gas However Germany was the first to use it in battle on March 15th 1915 when they used tear gas against France It was included in some of the new deadly weapons of World War One

During the Iran Iraq War Iraq used chemical weapons but not Iran Many people believe that Iraq used chemical weapons against Kurdish people

According to international law it is wrong to use chemical weapons There are many rules that ban the production import and use of chemical weapons Of these the most important is the Chemical Weapons Convention 

UN formed a working group in 1980 that works for making the number of chemical weapons in the world less On April 4 1984 the President of United States Ronald Reagan called for a worldwide ban on chemical weapons After this negotiations between various countries started The Chemical Weapons Convention was signed in 1993 and came into effect in 1997 Experts believe that 70000 metric tons of chemical weapons are known to be present totally in this world Out of this 8000 metric tons have been destroyed in the past few years By 2003 United States had destroyed 23 of its total chemical weapons Other countries like India South Korea and Russia are destroying chemical weapons under the CWC Libya is also destroying its weapons in the last few years 

It has been reported that many other countries like Peoples Republic of China Cuba Egypt Iran Israel North Korea Pakistan Sudan Syria Taiwan Serbia and Montenegro have chemical weapons

Iran used to be called Persia Iranians or Persians since the Sassanian era called their country Iran But the official name was Persia meaning that this was the name used in foreign relations and in government papers In 1935 Reza Shh Pahlavi then shh of Iran officially renamed the country Iran first time a move which was made to please Adolf Hitler The name Iran comes from Aryan and is also mentioned in the ancient book of the Zoroastrians which was called the Avesta Iran means Aryan in Persian In the 19th and early 20th century the name Aryan was used by Europeans to mean all Indo Europeans The Aryan Race was a term that Hitler used to describe his ideal Superior or perfect race though it originally meant Iranians

Around 500 BC present day Iran was the center of the Persian Empire The Greek city states fought against the Persian armies led by Darius the Great and Xerxes Then Alexander the Great took the country by fighting and the Achaemenid dynasty of Persia later ruled After them the Sassanian dynasty took over Other people took Persia by fighting like the Arabs Turks and Mongols However Iran has always maintained a distinct culture and continued to survive

The CIA worked in Iran to create riots which led to the removal of Prime Minister Mossadegh The United States and Great Britain then made the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi King of Iran again He ruled in Iran for less than a year when he left Iran and the Iranian government was changed to an Islamic Republic by Islamic Revolution Soon afterwards Iranian Students Movement with the backing of the new government took over the US Embassy in Tehran and held most of the diplomats hostage for 444 days Relations between the two countries have not been good since For example The US has imposed various types of economic sanctions against Iran The US claims the Iran supports terrorist groups against Israel Iran does not recognize Israel as a state Iran along with most Arab countries believe that Israel does not have the right to occupy the land of Palestinians 

Iran has long borders in common with Iraq This war changed politics in the Middle East and world wide Iranians are ethnically not Arabs Iran defended itself against Iraqi invasion in 1980 a war that lasted eight years Many Arab and Western countries including the United States provided weapons and technical support for Iraqs Saddam Hussein 

Now the West is trying to prevent Iran from mastering nuclear technology even though Iran is a member of the NPT They voice their concern claiming that Irans intention is to develop nuclear weapons The International Atomic Energy Agency has reported numerous times that there is no evidence that Iran is developing nuclear weapons however it also says that it can not say for sure that Iran is not doing so in secret A CIA report on nuclear activity in Iran in December 2007 claimed that Irans secret program to achieve nuclear weapons technology was stopped in 2003 and that since then it was never restarted It reports that Irans ability to build a nuclear weapon will probably not happen soon

Siddhrta Gautama is the person who began the religion of Buddhism He lived from about 563 BCE to about 483 BCE He was the most recent Buddha and some people just call him the Buddha He is also called Sakyamuni or Tathgata Some Buddhists believe that Siddhrtha Gautama was a perfect person

There are many old stories about the life of the Buddha No one knows which stories are true and which stories are made up But most historians think that the Buddha was a real person He was very kind and wise and wanted to change the world

Old stories say that Siddhrtha Gautama was born in the kingdom of Kapilavastu in Nepal At that time a clan called the Shakyas ruled Kapilavastu His father was a king named Suddodana Gautama and his mother was the beautiful Mahamaya Siddhrtha lived in luxury his father kept trouble and hard work far from him A seer predicted that if Siddhrtha stayed inside his palace his whole life then he would become a great king However if he left the palace then he would become a great religious leader The king did not want his son to become a religious leader He kept Siddhartha in the palace for his whole childhood

When he was older his father found a woman for Siddhrtha to marry at the age of 16 He married the woman named Yashodhara and they had a son Rahula Although Gautama had everything he could want he still was not happy He wanted to learn the meaning of his existence

He got out of the castle against his fathers orders He saw the Four Passing Sights an old crippled man a sick man a dead man and a holy man with no home Right then Gautama knew that nothing can stop people from being born becoming old getting sick and dying He decided to give up his worldly life He would not keep his wives his children his wealth or his palace He would become a holy man with no home He would look for the answer to the problem of birth old age sickness and death He left his home in the middle of the night

At that time holy men were usually ascetics They hurt their bodies in order to help their spiritual beings They do not do things they like so they can defeat their desires The most ascetic kinds of holy men were called Jains They practiced self denial and made themselves suffer very much They believed this would free the tman from pain and sadness Siddhrtha did these things well Eventually he was better than his teachers He still found no answer and he left his teachers Some friends and he went even farther He ate only six grains of rice a day He tried not breathing He became just skin and bones and he nearly died Still he had no answer

Siddhrtha started to think again about this path He thought there might be a better way than hurting himself He found a big tree and started to meditate He told himself that he would not get up until he had found enlightenment He meditated under the tree for 49 days His mind is said to have become pure and then six years after he began his path he said he found Enlightenment and became a Buddha

When the Buddha became enlightened he knew the answer to suffering and he knew how to defeat suffering This answer was called the Four Noble Truths He was not sure if he should teach his new ideas or not He asked himself if the world was ready for such a deep teaching But in the end he decided to travel to a town called Sarnath to teach the people his new way He taught about the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path The people listened to him

When he taught he did not pretend to be a god He said he was just a man who had found the meaning of life and that any person can also find the meaning of life For the rest of his life he walked all over Southern Nepal and parts of India to teach people what he believed He started a Sangha which is a group of Buddhist monks and nuns Many people became enlightened because of him At the age of 80 Gautama Buddha died

The teachings of the Buddha are known as Buddhism Buddhism is mostly about ending the feeling of pain that all people feel inside Gautama Buddha taught that pain is a part of all life He taught that pain is because of desire And he showed that there is a way to end desire and end pain by doing good things not doing bad things and training ones mind This is done to end pain and gain enlightenment

Buddhism teaches non harm and balance not going too far one way or the other The Buddha taught people to meditate or think deeply while sitting in the lotus position Some Buddhist chant and meditate while walking Buddhists sometimes do these things to understand the human heart and mind Sometimes they do these things to understand the way the world works Sometimes they do these things to find peace

The Buddha would not say if gods exist or not He taught that people should not look to gods to save them or bring them enlightenment The gods may have power over world events and they might help people or they might not But Buddha believed that it is up to each person to become enlightened

Epiphany was made from Galeon by Marco Pesenti Gritti with the aim of making a web browser with a very simple user experience Because of that Epiphany does not have its own themes instead it uses GNOMEs settings that are set in the GNOME Control Center

A video game console is a machine that is used to play video games Video game consoles usually connect to a television 

Special controllers are attached to the console to control the game Some video game consoles are handheld They can be carried around and have their own screens The Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable are examples of handheld consoles Some video game consoles can also run general software such as Linux

Examples of game consoles include

An election is a way people can choose their candidate or their preferences in a democracy or other form of government 

Most democratic countries hold new elections for their national legislature every few years but this differs from country to country Some democracies elect other national officials In others these are appointed Democratic countries also hold local elections Some democracies have regional provincial or state elections too

There are different ways to organize an election in different countries Voters might vote for an individual or they might vote for a political party This is because different countries use different voting systems

Countries that are not democracies can also hold elections This is usually done to let the people choose a local representative Also many countries call themselves democracies but behind the scenes have a more autocratic form of governmentElections are done between the main person and the opposition

Psephology is the study of elections

Medicine is the science that deals with diseases in humans and animals the best ways to prevent diseases and the best ways to return to a healthy condition

People who practice medicine are most often called medical doctors or physicians Often doctors work closely with nurses and many other types of health care professionals

The word medicine can also mean special food or a chemical that makes someone better when they are ill A lot of medicines are liquid and can be bought in a small bottle Other medicines may come in pills or capsules 

The doctor may tell the patient how much medicine to take each day Most medicines cannot be bought unless a doctor has prescribed the medicine for the patient The patient takes the prescription to the chemist who gives them the medicine

There are different aspects of medicine that specialist doctors deal with For example paediatrics is the study of diseases that affect children

Transport or transportation is moving people or things from one place to another place Transport can be divided into infrastructure vehicles and operations

Infrastructure includes roads railways airways canals and pipelines The infrastructure is the network where things are carried Infrastructure also includes airports railway stations bus stations and seaports Infrastructure is usually built by governments and paid for by taxes from the citizens of a country or region Infrastructure such as roads and railways is designed by civil engineers and urban planners

Vehicles or vessels travel on the infrastructure Vehicles include cars trucks trains and airplanes Vehicles are usually designed by mechanical engineers Vessels include boats ferries and barges which travel on canals and use docks and seaports In the same way that trains use train stations airplanes use airports In the same way that trains use railway lines airplanes use flight paths

Operations control the system Operations include traffic signals railway signals and air traffic control Operations also include the government policies and regulations used to control the system such as tolls fuel taxes and traffic laws

Transport and communication can be used instead of each other But the growth in traffic is only possible because of communication So an increase of either transport or communication usually leads to an increase in the other one

Transport uses a lot of energy Most transport uses hydrocarbons This can create pollution Environmental regulations and low pollution fuels can reduce pollution But as more vehicles are used more pollution is created Ethanol and biodiesel pollute less than petroleum

There are three main kinds of transportation They are

People have been making roads for a long time Roman roads and the Incan courier roads are famous But transport by river was usually easier and faster than transport by road In the industrial revolution the railway was invented A railway is a special type of road using rails Roads are now usually made for wheeled vehicles like cars to travel on

Road building and care is usually paid for by taxes Some roads have tolls where people pay to use the road 

2004 was a leap year starting on Thursday of the Gregorian calendar

From west to east Hawaii is made up of the following Hawaiian Islands

Hawaii has been a state since 1959

Mauna Kea is a dormant volcano in the Hawaiian Islands It is the highest point in Hawaii at 4205 meters If measured from top to bottom below sea level it is 10200 meters high and would be the tallest mountain in the world It is around 1000000 years old Mauna Kea means white mountain because in winter it often has snow at the summit 

Mauna Kea is an important site for astronomy with many different countries or institutions having an observatory there  It is an important site for its low clear skies

High altitude is important because atmosphere causes an effect called seeing which limits the quality of images by blurring them By having a low altitude there is more atmosphere between the observatories and space and this lessens the effect

Mauna Loa is an active volcano in the Hawaiian Islands of the United States Measured from sea level Mauna Loa is 4169 meters high It is also one of the largest volcanoes measuring 60 miles long and 30 miles wide It is about 40000 cubic meters in volume and over 4 kilometers above sea level Measured from its base on the ocean floor it reaches above 8 kilometers making it the tallest mountain on Earth but not the highest That distinction is reserved for Mount Everest

Kilauea is an active volcano in the Hawaiian Islands It is a shield volcano Kilauea is 1277 meters high Kilauea is a large lake of lava The crater of Kilauea is named PuuOo The first eruption of Kilauea is estimated as 300 to 600 thousand years ago Its first recorded eruptions were in 1823 Its most recent eruption was 3 January 1983 It is still erupting now The Hawaiian name Kilauea means spewing or much spreading It refers to the constant flow of lava Kilauea lies on the curve of volcanoes on the island of Hawaii that includes Mauna Loa and Kohala The volcano of Kilauea is one of the youngest and also is said to be the home of an ancient volcano goddess Pele The oldest dated rocks are said to be about 23000 years old It has its own magma plumbing under the Earth that goes down under the Earths crust by 60 km Kilauea has a basalt based lava rock type Kilauea was formed on a volcanic hot spot

A van is a type of vehicle A van is usually bigger than the regular sized car It can usually carry many people sometimes up to a total of 15 Panel vans are used for deliveries These usually have fewer windows

Many companies make vans including Chevrolet Daihatsu Dodge Fiat Ford GMC Honda Hyundai Isuzu Mazda Mercedes Benz Mitsubishi Nissan Subaru Suzuki Toyota Vauxhall and Volkswagen

A minivan is smaller and usually carries up to seven people

People use luggage to carry their possessions when travelling In the United States luggage is often called baggage

Pan can mean

A pantograph is an machine It is used in drawing or planning It makes it easy to copy diagrams 

The device that an electric train uses to get its electricity is also called a pantograph because it looks a bit like the drawing instrument

A paperback is a type of book It has a thin cardboard cover Another name for paperback is soft cover Paperback book covers can bend and be folded They are not as strong as hardback books and they break easier Usually paperback books cost less money than hardback books

A palette is used for mixing coloursThey are usually made out of plastic or wood but can be made out of other materials An artist often uses one of these and is in fact an essential item in art when painting

A glow worm or glowworm is an insect Other names for glow worms are fire fly and lightning bug

There are several insects given this name Most are beetles but one is a fly Arachnocampa They are nocturnal active during the night They have special organs that can produce light This is used to find mates The patterns in which the beetles flash is unique per species

The major families are

A palette knife is a blunt knife with a very flexible steel blade and no sharpened cutting edge It is a tool

Foolscap is lined legal size paper It is called foolscap because in the 18th century folio sized paper had the watermark of a fools cap on it

In the UK foolscap paper is 13 X 8 but paper of the size is now very rarely used being superseded by A4 Older people may call A4 foolscap Nevertheless ring binders lever arch files suspended files and other filing related things still use the size

Also refer to Foolscap folio

A polymer is a molecule made from joining together many small molecules called monomers The word polymer can be broken down into poly and mer This shows how the chemical composition of a polymer consists of many smaller units bonded together into a larger molecule A chemical reaction bonding monomers together to make a polymer is called polymerization 

Some polymers are natural Proteins have polypeptide molecules which are natural polymers made from various amino acid monomer units Nucleic acids are huge natural polymers made up of millions of nucleotide units Cellulose and starch are also natural polymers made up of glucopyranose monomer bonded together in different ways Some polymers are man made Plastics rubber and fibers are made up of polymers 

If the units called monomers in a polymer are all the same then the polymer is called a homopolymer Homopolymers are named by adding the prefix poly before the monomer name from which the polymer is made For example a polymer made by bonding styrene monomer molecules together is called polystyrene  

If the monomers are not all the same the polymer is called a copolymer or a heteropolymer 

Many polymer molecules are like chains where the monomer units are the links Polymer molecules can be straight chain have branching from the main chain or cross linking between chains As an example of cross linking sulfhydryl groups in two cysteine amino acid units in polypeptide chains can bond together to make a disulfide bridge joining the chains together 

A medium is the way or means information is sent or received Paper is a common medium used every day by millions of people Television is another very common medium it is said that there is not a community on Earth where at least one family does not own a television The plural form of medium is media so radio and television are both types of broadcast media but paint charcoal ink and clay are types of artistic media When people buy or sell things the medium is often coins or paper money but it may also be shells gems livestock or even an agreement to perform a service in the future 

A medium is also a person who it is said can pass messages between the living and the dead This type of medium was quite popular in the West in the 19th century but most were found to be dishonest and few remain today In Taoism mediums still work However the power of mediums is mostly believed by the superstitious

Medium is also a size coming between small and large Other words used in this way include intermediate average and middle

A phrase is a small group of words that adds meaning to a word A phrase is not a sentence because it is not a complete idea with a subject and a predicate 

In English there are five different kinds of phrases one for each of the main parts of speech In a phrase the main word or the word that is what the phrase is about is called the head In these examples it is printed in bold The other words in the phrase do the work of changing or modifying the head

In a noun phrase one or more words work together to give more information about a noun

In an adjective phrase one or more words work together to give more information about an adjective

In a verb phrase one or more words work together to give more meaning to a verb In English the verb phrase is very complex but a good description of its many forms can be found here

In an adverb phrase one or more words work together to give more information about an adverb

In a prepositional phrase one or more words work together to give information about time location or possession or condition The preposition always appears at the front of the phrase

Prepositions are words or word groups which begin a noun phrase with more than one word Most prepositions tell where or when or show possession

Prepositions like in beside above and out of all tell where and are usually used with nouns or pronouns Some examples with the phrases underlined The man sat close to his wife He put his arm around her shoulder Then he kissed her on the cheek 

Prepositions like right after until during and before all tell when Mr Prasad had an important meeting until ten oclock During the meeting his cell phone rang It was his wife She asked him to come straight home right after work

The prepositions of and to are used to show possession or belonging to This book belongs to Vlad The cover of the book is torn

Here is a list of Prepositions

To possess is to have or to own I possess all my teeth means I still have all I was born with The woman possesses five cars means she owns five cars A possession is something you own My only possessions are my cat and my brains

In some beliefs to be possessed is to be under the control of devils demons or evil spirits These people may do evil or terrible things because of their possession Sometimes this possession was because the person had epilepsy As the reasons for epilepsy were not known people decided it was caused by evil

A pronoun is traditionally called a part of speech in grammar In English pronouns are words such as me she his them herself each other it what 

Pronouns are often used to take the place of a noun when that noun is understood to avoid repeating it For example instead of saying 

it is easier to say 

When a pronoun replaces a noun the noun is called the antecedent But there are times when the pronoun has no antecedent This is because generally the antecedent refers grammatically to the use of the relative pronoun in particular For example in the sentence The dog that was walking down the street the relative pronoun is the word that referring back to the antecedent the word dog In the sentence The spy who loved me the relative pronoun is the word who and its antecedent is the word spy

Pronouns are different from common nouns because they normally can not come after articles or other determiners Pronouns also rarely come after adjectives They are also different because many of them change depending on how they are used For example we is a subject in grammar but the word changes to us when used as an object

Pronouns are the same as nouns because they both change for number case and gender Nouns and pronouns can be used in almost all the same places in sentences and they name the same kinds of things people objects etc Even though they can not normally come after determiners or adjectives neither can proper nounsS P R A K E N 

There are four kinds of pronouns personal reciprocal interrogative and relative

This table shows all the personal pronouns in English that are commonly used today

A Subject Pronoun can replace a noun that is the subject of a sentence Refer to the table above the subject pronouns are I You He She It We They 

Another type of personal pronoun is called the reflexive pronoun Reflexive pronouns are the words ending in self or selves such as myself itself themselves

An adverb is a word used to tell more about a verb and it almost always answers the questions how when where how often and in what way Words like slowly loudly carefully quickly or sadly are all adverbs Adverbs usually but not always end in ly

Examples of adverbs in a sentence

An adverb can also modify an adjective or another adverb

Examples

In the first two examples the word well is an adverb In the last example it is an adjective This is one example in which the same word can be both an adjective and an adverb but not in the same sentence 

As a rule the same word can play different roles but not in the same sentence It all depends on what the word is doing in the sentence It could be a noun an adjective an adverb a verb etc Example take the word cool In the sentence he walks cool the word cool is an adverb In the sentence cool the hot dish the word cool is a verb In the sentence it is a cool evening the word cool is an adjective In the first example he walks cool the word cool really means coolly as in play it cool

Most adverbs are formed by adding ly to the end of an adjective To see 100 adjectives used in Basic English click here   adjective

Sunday is one of the seven days of the week It is part of the weekend along with Saturday Sunday is the day of worship for most Christians Sunday is the beginning of the week in the United States but is the end of the week in the United Kingdom

Ottawa is the capital of Canada and is part of the province of Ontario It is south of the Ottawa River The population in 2004 was about 808391 people in the city itself The region has about 1146790 people in it The mayor of the city today is Jim Watson Ottawa is located in the Ottawa Valley on the border with the province of Quebec Ottawa is the fourth largest city in Canada 

When people talk about Ottawa they could also mean the highest government in Canada and not its local government or the city

The cities of Ottawa Kanata Nepean Gloucester and Vanier and the villages of Manotick and Rockcliffe Park joined in the year 2000 to form the new city of Ottawa Ottawa also includes Orlans which joined at that same time

The city began with the name Bytown and became the city of Ottawa in 1855 The Rideau Canal ends in Ottawa

Ottawa has many museums many buildings for the government of Canada and many parks There is a market area downtown

There are many festivals during the year including Winterlude in February The Tulip Festival in May and BluesFest in the summer There is also a large celebration on July 1st for Canada Day

The Ottawa Senators play ice hockey in Scotiabank Place

A news agency is a kind of company It supplies information to newspapers radio and television

In the United Kingdom and some other countries a news agency or newsagent is a shop which sells newspapers magazines and cigarettes

A mudguard is a part of a car motorcycle scooter or bicycle People use it to stop mud water or other objects from coming up onto the vehicle or the person and also to protect the engine from mud

A Para rubber tree is the tree which naturally produces rubber It is native from tropical areas from South America in the Amazon but was spread by English farmers to the Far East

Para Rubber trees belong to the Euphorbiaceae family In the wild they may reach heights of 100 to 125 ft with large cylindrical trunks with or without buttresses Crop trees reach a width of about 20 in usually with a short bole and with a sloped taper 

When trees reach 5 6 years old they are harvested Their trunks are cut just deep enough to tap the vessels without harming the trees growth and the sap is collected in small buckets This process is known as rubber tapping Older trees produce more latex but they stop producing it after 26 30 years

A safety curtain is a curtain in theatre at the front of the stage It is made of material that will not burn The safety curtain may be lowered during the intermission and after the performance A safety curtain is there in case there is a fire on stage It will stop the fire from spreading to the auditorium where the audience sits

A safety lamp is a miners lamp with a covered flame that used to be used in coal mines

Coal mines are dangerous because of flammable gases like methane that can accumulate A lamp with a naked flame might ignite these flammable gases causing an explosion which might kill people The safety lamp prevents the hot flame of the lamp touching the flammable gasses reducing the chance of an explosion

A Christmas stocking is a long sock hung by a fireplace or bed on Christmas Eve Christmas presents are put into it for children And it came from an old legend which have now turned into an European tradition

These are the Austrian football teams and the leagues they played in for the 201011 season

The champion of the league promotes to the Austrian Bundesliga

The Regionalliga is divided into three sections The second teams of clubs from the first division are not allowed to promote to the Second Division

2001 was a common year starting on Monday of the Gregorian calendar It was also the 1st year of the 3rd millennium and the 21st century

Sex is a type of reproduction common among living things It always needs two individuals usually of the same species Sex is used by plants and animals and also by fungi and various single celled organisms It works by combining genes from more than one source 

Organisms may have more than one kind of reproduction

Asexual reproduction is easier than sexual reproduction but there are benefits and drawbacks to both

A persons sex is either male or female For example Johns sex is male Janes sex is female This difference is sometimes called gender 

In humans the sex of a person depends on what sex chromosomes that person has in his or her sex cells A womans ovum contains one X chromosome A mans sperm contains either an X or a Y chromosome When a sperm and ova combine to form a fertilised egg the baby may get either of these chromosomes from its father If the baby gets two X chromosomes it will develop into a girl If the baby gets one X and one Y it will develop into a boy 

There are occasional exceptions to this rule the process of meiosis which makes the sex cells can go wrong This results in an individual having 3 X chromosomes or 2 Y chromosomes or XXY instead of XY Such people may get physical or mental defects which require treatment Examples of such defects are Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Obsessive Compulsive Disorder mental retardation or schizophrenia These people may also have a weaker immune system and might not be fertile

Before babies are born they grow either male sex parts or female sex parts

Sexual reproduction first appeared about a billion years ago It evolved within single celled eukaryotes The scientific community still discusses why it appeared and why it still exists Reasons commonly given include

Sexual reproduction is a process that can only be found in eukaryotes These cells have a nucleus and mitochondria There are other kinds of organisms the other eukaryotes such as the malaria parasite that also engage in sexual reproduction Some bacteria use conjugation to transfer genetic material between bacteria This is not the same as sexual reproduction but it also results in the mixture of genetic traits

In sexual reproduction the cells used for reproduction called gametes are either eggs or sperms Fertilisation needs two different such cells The mechanism of cell division only works when one sperm alone enters the egg Once it is in a fast reaction goes through the egg cell wall to shut off all other sperm

Sex determination in biology is about the function of sex not what individuals look like In humans males and females usually look different In many species they do not except for the sex organs Sex can be determined in different ways

When there is sex determination there are basically two cases

Usually sex is determined by an organisms genes With genetic sex determination most alleles or genes that influence sexual development are on the same chromosome That chromosome is then called the sex chromosome Because genetic sex determination is controlled by a pair of sex chromosomes there are usually the same number of male and female offspring In humans for instance sperms carry either an X or a Y chromosome and they occur in roughly equal numbers

For some species sex is not determined by inheritance but instead by environmental factors experienced during development or later in life Many reptiles have temperature dependent sex determination the temperature embryos experience during their development determines the sex of the organism In some turtles for example males are produced at lower incubation temperatures than females this difference in critical temperatures can be as little as 1 2 C

Some fish change sex over the course of their life This phenomenon is called sequential hermaphroditism In clownfish smaller fish are male and the dominant and largest fish in a group becomes female In many wrasse the opposite is truemost fish are female at birth and become male when they reach a certain size Sequential hermaphrodites may produce both types of gametes over the course of their lifetime but at any given point they are either female or male

In some ferns the default sex is hermaphrodite Ferns which grow in soil which has previously supported hermaphrodites are influenced by hormones remaining to develop as male

A hacksaw is a tool for sawing A hacksaw is useful for cutting materials such as metal and bone It has a handle on one end and can be either pushed or pulled across the object being cut There are manual and electric hacksaws

In gardening a spade is a tool A spade is a particular kind of shovel made for digging It has a pointed end and a straight handle In some countries such as Australia the difference between a spade and a shovel is important It is hard to move gravel with a spade but a proper shovel can do it

In game a spade is one of the four shapes on playing cards It is coloured black and not the one that looks like cross

A hoe is a tool in farming and gardening It has a blade usually metal attached to a long handle usually wood There are many types of blade and a variety of uses probably the most common of which is weeding Along with the spade and fork the hoe is considered a basic essential hand farming implement

A shovel is a tool used for digging When it picks up the dirt it makes a hole They are usually made out of metal at the bottom and wood is used for the handle

A plunger is a tool It is used to get rid of things that are blocking pipes The plunger is placed over one end of the pipe and the handle is pushed up and down Doing this creates a sucking force which makes the thing blocking the pipe move and unclog

A ladder is a tool which is made for people to climb up or down Ladders have two vertical supports that go along the whole length of the ladder Between these supports are the horizontal rungs The rung is what the climber can put his foot on The climber can use his hands to hold on to the rungs above him or to the supports at the side

Ladders can be made of metal wood or even rope There are different types of ladders

Some ladders are made in one piece They can be carried around and made to lean against something such as the wall of a house There should be a good distance between the bottom of the ladder and the wall so that the ladder is not too vertical otherwise the ladder might fall backwards and the climber would fall off Sometimes these ladders are extension ladders Extension ladders are made in two or more sections so that the ladder can fold up to make it easier to carry about and to store To open up the ladder each section slides up almost to the top of the next section

Step ladders are useful in the home or the garden to reach things that are not too high eg ceilings or the tops of hedges They have two parts which are joined together by a hinge so that they are shaped like an upside down V There is usually a platform at the top to stand on but this can be dangerous unless great care is taken that the ladder will not wobble or fall down

Some ladders are vertical These are fixed onto something Examples are ladders in a swimming pool for climbing in and out of the water small ladders to climb up to a top bunk bed ladders at the side of a big boat or at the side of a canal lock or of any other high or low construction where workmen may need to get up or down to do repairs

Fire engines always have ladders They often have a turntable ladder which makes it possible for the ladder to be facing in any direction

Rope ladders can be folded away easily They may be used for climbing trees or for rock climbing or in caves

Oral history is history that is told rather than written down It is given through talking rather than reading a book It is usually passed from generation to generation in order to explain events that have occurred 

Though today oral history is not as popular as written history it is still used in many places as a way of transferring knowledge about the past

A generation is used to mean the average amount of time between the birth of parents and the birth of their children It is also used to mean all the people on one level of a family tree For example your brothers sisters and cousins are in the same generation as you

Genes are formed of DNA DNA is a collection of chemical information that carries the instructions for making all the proteins a cell will ever need Each gene contains a single set of instructions These instructions usually code for a particular protein Half of a persons genes come from the mother The other half come from the father

Originally a hereditary unit which occupies a specific position on a chromosome Other definitions are ways the gene showed itself 

Modern definitions must take note of later discoveries There are now two classes of genesp173

Genes are passed on from parent to child and are an important part of what decides how children look and act Genes affect the way our bodies work including how we look Our eye hair and skin color are decided by genes It is said that genes cause genetic effects in our bodies

Sometimes a gene is dominant Sometimes it is recessive For example lets say a mother only has genes for brown hair and a father only has genes for red hair The child will inherit receive genes for red hair and brown hair The brown hair gene is dominant to the red hair gene This means the child will have brown hair even though she has genes for both red and brown hair This means only one dominant gene is needed for the child to receive that particular trait while two recessive genes are needed for one

A recessive trait might stay hidden for many generations Let us use the child from the last example We will call her Mary Mary has brown hair but has genes for both red and brown hair Let us say Mary grew up and married Tom Tom also has brown hair but like Mary one of his parents had red hair This means Tom has genes for both red and brown hair Mary and Tom would each have a chance of passing either brown or red hair genes to their children This means that the children of Mary and Tom could have either red or brown hair This explains why a person might look different from their parents but look like their grandparents or great grandparents

Alliteration is when a sentence or phrase has many words that do not necessarily start with the same letter but it seems like a lot of the time it does It is commonly used in advertising poetry headlines and tongue twisters Basically the first consonant repeats itself throughout the sentence

Homophones are words that sound the same as another word but have a different meaning and often a different spelling Examples

Condensation is the process in which water vapour changes into a water droplet or ice crystal when it touches a cooler surface Condensation is an important part of the water cycle It is the opposite of evaporation

Condensation of water is when water turns from gas to a liquid or crystal shape Any gas can condensate usually at a low temperatures or high pressure However condensation can technically happen at any temperature so long as the pressure of the condensing gas is more than the pressure of the liquid state of that gas

Condensation is vital in nature and is always the same as temperature and vapour pressure in nature This means that if there is a lot of condensation the temperature goes up Alternatively if there is hardly any condensation there will be a temperature loss

It is a process that can be useful to man One use is in the creation of new water 

However since there is a temperature gain when a lot of condensation happens the heat needs to be removed which can be broken wikt linktroublesometroublesome and expensive

Precipitation is the water falling from clouds in liquid form or in solid form

Precipitation is water or ice falling to the Earth Rain snow sleet dew frost hail and drizzle are all forms of precipitation It is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor that is left on the ground It can be measured using a rain gauge

Rain the most common form of precipitation is liquid water that falls from the clouds to Earth The most common form of solid precipitation is snow Snow is made when temperatures are so cold that water vapor changes directly to a solid

Precipitation is also a chemical reaction when two or more solutions are mixed together and the product is insoluble a precipitate is formed This is a precipitation reaction

Relative humidity is a way of describing how much humidity there is in the air compared to how much there could be Meteorologists often use the relative humidity as a measurement to describe the weather at various places

When the temperature is warm more water vapor can be in the air than when it is cold If the actual amount of vapor is compared to the total amount there could be as a fraction then the number tells if the air feels dry or moist The value is usually written in percent where 0 means that the air is totally dry and 100 means that it is so moist that mist or dew is about to form

When the temperature is lowered a lot then the water vapor turns into condensation or precipitation as dew rain or snow

Vitamin C also known as ascorbic acid is found in fresh fruits berries and green vegetables It is one of the water soluble vitamins 

Vitamin C is important in wound healing Lack of vitamin C can cause a sickness called scurvy where the gums in the mouth bleed easily and wounds do not heal Lack of Vitamin C was a serious health problem on long ocean trips where supplies of fresh fruit were quickly used up Many people died from scurvy on such trips

Most animals make their own vitamin C Some mammalian groups cannot Those that cannot include the main suborder of primates the Haplorrhini tarsiers monkeys and apes including human beings Others include bats capybaras and guinea pigs

Vitamin C was first found in 1928 and in 1932 it was proved to stop the sickness called scurvy

Through history the need for people to eat fresh plant food to help them get through long sieges or long sea trips was known by some wise people but was often forgotten 

The first attempt to prove this idea was by a ships doctor in the British Royal Navy called James Lind who at sea in May 1747 gave some crew members lemon juice as well as their normal ships food while others continued on normal food alone

The results showed that lemons prevented the disease Lind wrote up his work and published it in 1753

Linds work was slow to be noticed In 1795 the British navy adopted lemon or lime juice as food for sailors

As well as lemons limes and oranges sauerkraut salted cabbage malt and soup were tried with different effects James Cook relied on sauerkraut to prevent the disease on his long voyages of exploration

It was believed that only humans got scurvy but in 1907 Alex Holst and Theodore Frohlich two Norwegian chemists found that guinea pigs could also get it if not given fresh food

In 1928 the Arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson proved that Eskimo people are able to avoid scurvy with almost no plant food in their diet by eating raw meat

In 1912 the Polish American scientist Casimir Funk first used the word vitamin for something present in food in small amounts that is essential to health He named the unknown thing that prevented scurvy Vitamin C

From 1928 to 1933 the Hungarian research team of Joseph L Svirbely and Albert Szent Gyorgyi and separately the American Charles Glen King first took out vitamin C from food and showed it to be an acid they called ascorbic acid

In 19331934 the British chemists Sir Walter Norman Haworth and Sir Edmund Hirst and separately the Polish Tadeus Reichstein successfully synthesized the vitamin It was the first man made vitamin This made it possible to make lots of vitamin C cheaply in factories Haworth won the 1937 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for this work

In 1959 the American JJ Burns showed that the reason why some animals get scurvy is because their liver cannot make one chemical enzyme that other animals have

Citrus fruits are good sources of vitamin C

Other foods that are good sources of vitamin C include papaya broccoli brussels sprouts blackcurrants strawberries cauliflower spinach cantaloupe green peppers and kiwifruit

The following table is to give an idea of how much vitamin C is in different plant foods Each individual fruit will vary

The amount of vitamin C in foods of plant origin depends on the kind of plant the kind of soil where it grew how much rain and sun it got the length of time since it was picked and how it was stored since then Cooking food destroys vitamin C

Most species of animals synthesise their own vitamin C It is therefore not a vitamin for them Synthesis is achieved through a sequence of enzyme driven steps which convert glucose to ascorbic acid It is carried out either in the kidneys in reptiles and birds or the liver in mammals and perching birds The loss of an enzyme concerned with ascorbic acid synthesis has occurred quite frequently in evolution and has affected most fish many birds some bats guinea pigs and most but not all primates including Man The mutations have not been lethal because ascorbic acid is so prevalent in the surrounding food sources

It was only realised in the 1920s that some cuts of meat and fish are also a source of vitamin C for humans The muscle and fat that make up the modern western diet are however poor sources As with fruit and vegetables cooking destroys the vitamin C content

Vitamin C is produced from glucose by two main routes The Reichstein process developed in the 1930s uses a single pre fermentation followed by a purely chemical route The more modern Two Step fermentation process was originally developed in China in the 1960s uses additional fermentation to replace part of the later chemical stages Both processes yield approximately 60 vitamin C from the glucose feed

In 1934 the Swiss pharmaceutical company Hoffmann La Roche was the first to mass produce synthetic vitamin C under the brand name of Redoxon Main producers today are BASF Takeda Roche Merck and the China Pharmaceutical Group Ltd of the Peoples Republic of China

In living organisms ascorbate is an antioxidant since it protects the body against oxidative stress It is also a cofactor in at least eight enzymatic reactions including several collagen synthesis reactions that cause the most severe symptoms of scurvy when they are dysfunctional In animals these reactions are especially important in wound healing and in preventing bleeding from capillaries

Lack of ascorbic acid in the daily diet leads to a disease called scurvy a form of avitaminosis that is characterized by

A healthy person on a balanced western diet should be able to get all the vitamin C needed to prevent the symptoms of scurvy from their daily diet People who smoke those under stress and women in pregnancy have a slightly higher requirement

The amount of vitamin C needed to avoid deficiency symptoms and maintain health has been set by variously national agencies as follows

Some researchers have calculated the amount needed for an adult human to achieve similar blood serum levels as Vitamin C synthesising mammals as follows

High doses may result in diarrhoea which is harmless if the dose is reduced immediately Some researchers claim the onset of diarrhoea to be an indication of where the bodys true vitamin C requirement lies

The small size of the ascorbic acid molecule means the kidneys cannot retain it in the body Quite a low level in the blood serum will cause traces to be present in the urine All vitamin C synthesising mammals have traces in the urine at all times

In April 1998 Nature reported alleged carcinogenic and teratogenic effects of excessive doses of vitamin C This was given great prominence in the worlds media The effects were noted in test tube experiments and on only two of the 20 markers of free radical damage to DNA They have not been supported by further evidence from living organisms Almost all mammals manufacture their own vitamin C in amounts equivalent to human doses of thousands of milligrams per day Large amounts of the vitamin are used in orthomolecular medicine and no harmful effects have been observed even in doses of 10000 mg per day or more

Vitamin C is needed in the diet to prevent scurvy It also has a reputation for being useful in the treatment of colds and flu The evidence to support this idea however is ambiguous and the effect may depend on the dose size and dosing regime The Vitamin C foundation recommends 8 grams of vitamin C every half hour to show an effect on cold symptoms

Fred R Klenner a doctor in Reidsville North Carolina reported in 1949 that poliomyelitis yielded to repeated megadoses of intravenous vitamin C

Nobel Prize winning chemist Linus Pauling began actively promoting vitamin C in the 1960s as a means to greatly improve human health and resistance to disease A minority of medical and scientific opinion continues to see vitamin C as being a low cost and safe way to treat infectious disease and to deal with a wide range of poisons A megadose of one half gram per pound of body weight per day of sodium ascorbate salt has been found of theraputic use in both human and veterinary treatmentsCitation neededdateOctober 2010

A meta study into the published research on effectiveness of ascorbic acid in the treatment of infectious disease and toxins was conducted in 2002 by Thomas Levy Medical Director of the Colorado Integrative Medical Center in Denver It claimed that overwhelming scientific evidence exists for its therapeutic role

Some vitamin C advocates say that vitamin C cannot be used therapeutically because it cannot now be patented Pharmaceutical companies are unwilling to research or promote something that will make them little money

DCPIP is a blue chemical used as a dye because when it is rusted it is blue Once DCPIP is reduced it does not have a color anymore This reaction can be reversed and the colourless DCPIP will turn blue again when it is oxidized

DCPIP is often used to measure the electron transport chain in plants It has a higher redox potential than the Fe S complex in cytochrome b and will therefore steal electrons from it This means that cytochrome c does not receive them The process cuts off the electron supply of photosystem I A common way to illustrate this change is by the addition of vitamin C solution This reduces the jelly by transforming it to a colourless mass This experiment can be carried out to illustrate the affect of changing cell sizes on SAV This is known as Titration

A healthy diet or balanced diet is a diet that contains the right amounts of all the food substances It includes fruit vegetables grains dairy products and protein It does not include too much or too little of any kind of food

Dye is a substance used to color materials It is often used to color the fabric used to make clothing

Poetry is a type of art form and a type of literature 

Poetry uses the qualities of words in different ways to be artistic

Poetry can be as short as a few words or as long as a book 

There are many poetic forms Some of them are Sonnet Haiku Ballad Stev Ode Free verse Blank verse thematic limerick and nursery rhymes

Poetry can be used to describe many things It can make sense or be nonsense it can rhyme or not It can have many shapes and sizes it can be serious or it can be funny 

To say something poetically means to give information in an artistic way

Literature is a group of works of art made up of words Most are written but some are passed on by word of mouth Literature usually means works of poetry and prose that are specially well written There are many different kinds of literature such as poetry plays or novels They can also be put into groups through their languagehistorical period origin genre and subject The word literature comes from the Latin word learning writing grammar

Most of the earliest works were epic poems Epic poems are long stories or myths about adventures Ramayana and Mahabharta two Indian epics are still read today Odyssey and Iliad are two famous Greek poems by Homer They were passed down through speaking and written down in the 8th century

Literature can also mean imaginative or creative writing which is looked at for its artistic value

Imagination is the ability to form images of things or events in ones mind When someone imagines something he is trying to picture something in his mind that he is not experiencing at the moment 

A calorimeter is an apparatus It is used to measure the amount of energy contained in a particular substance It may use a laser to determine the exact density of a solution

In biology a bolus is a ball shaped living thing

In medicine a bolus is a large amount of a drug given to patients to raise the blood level before treatment

A bolus can also refer to a ball of food after it has been chewed It passes down the oesophagus by peristalsis

The oesophagus also called the gullet is the part of the gastrointestinal system between the mouth and the stomach

The oesophagus is lined with muscle This muscle pushes the food bolus down into the stomach The oesophagus can contract or expand to allow for the passage of food The muscular movement that pushes the food down the oesophagus is called peristalsis At the entrance to the stomach there is a ring of muscle called a sphincter This is usually closed but relaxes as food approaches allowing it to enter the stomach In the stomach the food is churned until it turns into a soupy mixture called chyme

It is therefore adapted for transport rather than for digestion or adaptation

A protease is a digestive enzyme It breaks down long chains of proteins into shorter amino acids Protease can be divided into 6 types

Dental floss is a special type of thread It is used for cleaning spaces between teeth which cannot be reached by toothbrushes It is important to floss before brushing teeth and to floss at least once a day Tooth brushing will not clean food that is packed between teeth This food packing can lead to unhealthy teeth and gums Bacteria grow in this packed food between teeth These bacteria cause the surface of teeth to break down Then the teeth and gums and sometimes even the jaw can become seriously diseased 

These bacteria that come from the food on the teeth and between the teeth are called plaque or bacterial plaque and also can cause the gums to become less healthy Gingivitis which means gum disease is one type of disease that flossing helps to prevent Very serious diseases can start on the teeth and move to the bone of the jaw damaging the jaw badly Flossing your teeth reduces the danger of these serious diseases of the jaw bone These hard to cure jaw bone diseases are called periodontal disease 

Food that is trapped between the teeth can be uncomfortable and even cause pain Some food is hard for example meat apple Ground meat is soft and so is apple sauce Chicken and turkey meat are hard and full of fibres and very often get trapped between the teeth When hard food is trapped between the teeth it can cause discomfort and sometimes pain When hard food is pressed by the teeth against the gum it can cause pain Some people use toothpicks to try to remove trapped food from between the teeth and other people use dental floss to do this

Dental floss can do most things that a toothpick can do but dental floss is much thinner than a toothpick and can thus get to places that most toothpicks cannot reach So floss presumably does a better job at getting bits of food out from between the teeth relieving discomfort and pain quicker

When a person first starts flossing bleeding can happen This is normal and happens because teeth and gums that are not flossed are less healthy It will stop as the teeth and gums get healthier with flossing
