Fate is an opera by the Czech composer Leo Janek 

Janek wrote this opera between 1903 and 1905 His daughter Olga had died shortly before he began to compose it He had also just finished his opera Jenfa which has a tragic ending for the young girl in the story

The young lady who wrote the libretto for Janek had been one of his daughters close friends She wrote using the name Tlsk Janek thought the opera had autobiographical ideas He also wanted a change from writing about simple country people as he had done in Jenfa so the people in the story of Fate belong to the upper classes the rich people of society

The story of the opera is quite strange and unbelievable It has often been criticized for not being logical The story consists of lots of little scenes which make the story jump about The language of the libretto is very deliberately old fashioned Czech people who have worked with this opera have often felt that this formal language has made it hard for audiences to understand Some people have felt that when the opera is sung in other languages it is sometimes better because the language sounds more real

Nevertheless although the opera has had these criticisms the music is some of the best music that Janek wrote

The story takes place at the beginning of the 20th century which was the time in which Janek was composing it 

In Act I Gentlemen students and young girls are walking about in a health resort The men are interested in a girl called Mla Mla sees a young man called ivn in the crowd ivn is a composer He and Mla used to be lovers They had a child She tells ivn that it was her mother who made them split up so that she could marry someone rich Her mother had made her move away from Prague to give birth to the child in the country The two lovers now want to forget their unhappy past and live together with their little son Doubek

Act II takes place several years later They have been living together happily Mlas mother lives with them but has gone mad While the lovers read the story of an opera which seems to tell of their own lives the mother screams and ivn tears up the music of the opera The mother grabs her daughter and throws herself and Mla down the steep staircase

Act III takes place in a music conservatory eleven years later ivns students one of whom is their son Doubek are singing music from an opera that ivn has composed ivn himself is like the hero of his opera The last part of the opera has not yet been composed The students act out a scene from Doubeks childhood and make fun of it ivn talks about his opera A storm comes up and he is killed by lightning His opera will never be finished 

Dwarf allosaur is a species of theropod dinosaur that lived in Australia about 106 million years ago in the Cretaceous period It may be related to the Allosaurus but is smaller and lived 30 million years after all other allosaurs had gone extinct It is able to survive so long because Austro Antarctica prevents other dinosaurs from migrating there

It lived in the polar forest of Southern Australia which is in the Antarctic circle during that time It only lived there during the summer and would have migrated north during the winter because it would not survive the subzero temperature

Besides its poor fossil record it is famous for appearing in the BBC television series Walking with Dinosaurs

A baseball glove or mitt is a leather glove that baseball players use to catch a baseball that are hit by a batter or thrown by a fielder

Catcher Doug Allison in 1870 was the first ever to wear baseball gloves Dougs hands were split and cracked open from catching in other games earlier in the week He chose to wear something that would protect his hands so that they wouldnt be damaged more so he wore baseball gloves but he was laughed at and mocked by his teammates

Five years later in 1875 Charlie Waitt a St Louis outfielder and first baseman who in 1875 used a pair of flesh colored gloves but he was also laughed by his teammates Although baseball gloves were not used very much at first when they were first made more and more baseball players started to use baseball gloves over time probably when baseball star Albert Spalding began playing first base with a baseball glove When he started to wear them more infielders started to use gloves also because he was famous Before the mid 1890s baseball gloves were worn normally by baseball players Soon all baseball players started to wear baseball gloves

In by1920 Bill Doak a pitcher for the St Louis Cardinals suggested that a web be placed between the first finger and the thumb in order to create a pocket This design soon became added to baseball gloves and webbed gloves were starting to be used by all baseball players

Since the baseball glove was invented they have grown to what they look like today While catching in baseball was two handed gloves grew to a size that made it easier to catch the ball in the webbing of the glove and use the off hand to keep it from falling out A glove is worn on the non dominant hand leaving the dominant hand for throwing the ball for example a right handed player would wear a glove on the left hand By convention the type of glove that fits on the left hand is called a right handed or RH glove

The shape and size of the baseball glove is decided by official baseball rules Section 100 Objectives of the Game defines limits of catchers first basemans and fielders glove in parts 112 113 and 114

In baseball the Cy Young Award is an honor given to the best pitcher in the Major League Baseball The award was first introduced in 1956 by Commissioner Ford Frick in honor of Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young who died in 1955 The award was given to the best pitcher in the major leagues In 1967 the year after Frick retired as Commissioner the practice began of honoring one pitcher in each league the American League and the National League The 2009 American League Cy Young Award winner was Zack Greinke of the Kansas City Royals and the 2009 National League Cy Young Award winner was Tim Lincecum of the San Francisco Giants 

Each leagues award is voted on by two members of the Baseball Writers Association of America in each league city meaning 28 ballots are cast for the American League winner and 32 for the National League Each places a vote for first second and third place among the pitchers of each league The formula used to calculate the final scores is a weighted sum of the votes Score 5F 3S T where F is the number of first place votes S is second place votes and T is third place votes The pitcher with the highest score in each league wins the award If two pitchers receive the same number of votes the award is shared between the two

The current formula started with the 1970 season Prior to that writers only voted for the best pitcher and used a formula of one point per vote

Joseph Chamberlain was an important businessman and a politician He worked to improve education and cities He was a Member of Parliament from 1876 to 1914 and Colonial Secretary from 1895 to 1903 His son Austen won the Nobel Peace Prize and another son Neville was Prime Minister from 1937 to 1940

Chamberlain was born in Camberwell in London His father had a successful shoe company Joseph was a good student and won prizes at school in French and mathematics He left school when he was 16 years old and became an apprentice in his fathers company When he was 18 he moved to Birmingham to work in his uncles screw company He worked for the company until he was 38 and the company became very successful

Chamberlain was a Unitarian a Christian who believes Christ was an example of the way to live life but was not divine Unitarians try to work to help society There were many problems in Birmingham after the industrial revolution and many men were not allowed to vote In 1868 Chamberlain helped a liberal man to become the Member of Parliament for Birmingham In 1869 he started a group working for free primary education for all children 

In November 1869 he became a member of Birmingham City Council There he worked for cheaper land prices for rural workers and became very popular In 1873 he became the Mayor of Birmingham He bought the gas companies and water companies for the city so people were able to have clean and safe water He made parks roads schools museums and built new houses for poor people

In June 1876 he became the Member of Parliament for Birmingham In parliament he worked to unite radical MPs against the Whig party who were in power His work helped William Ewart Gladstone to become Prime Minister in 1880 Chamberlain often spoke about education in parliament

In 1880 Chamberlain became the President of the Board of Trade the government minister working to improve trade He made laws to help other cities to buy private companies as he had done in Birmingham He worked to make rents cheaper in Ireland which was a British colony At that time many people believed that Ireland should have its own parliament but many other people including Chamberlain strongly disagreed Chamberlain worked to help trade unions but warned against socialism saying that it would bring class war

In 1885 Lord Salisbury a conservative became prime minister and Chamberlain was no longer in government The Conservative government made many changes that pleased Chamberlain including free education for all children Because Chamberlain and many other liberals disagreed with the Liberal Party about Ireland Chamberlain made a new party the Liberal Unionists The Liberal Unionists shared power with the Conservatives against the Liberal party from 1886 but Chamberlain was not in the government

In June 1895 Chamberlain became Colonial Secretary of the government controlling what happened in British Colonies Because many European countries especially Germany and France were growing stronger Chamberlain wanted all countries in the British Empire to work together He also wanted Britain to take more land in Africa He built a railway along a part of the river Niger to help the British Royal Niger Company to grow This land together with the area Sokoto became modern Nigeria in 1901

Chamberlain also wanted Britain to control South Africa He asked for more British soldiers in South Africa He asked many British colonies to help and in return helped Australia to get its own constitution The Boers did not want Britain to control their land and in 1899 they attacked the British This was the start of the Second Boer War At first Britain had problems fighting the Boers but in 1900 the British became stronger

In Autumn 1900 Britain had a General Election Chamberlain asked people to vote for the same government to help win the war Because Chamberlain was very popular many people voted for the government and they stayed in control Chamberlain helped Winston Churchill to become a Member of Parliament

In May 1902 Britain won the Second Boer War Chamberlain visited South Africa to try to help make a better relationship between the two countries Back in Britain he also spoke to Zionist Jews and spoke about giving land in Kenya to them This plan was never realised Chamberlain tried to make an alliance with Germany but when this did not work he made an alliance between France and Britain This was called the Entente cordiale and ended hundreds of years of fighting between the two countries

Chamberlain believed that the countries in the British Empire should do business with each other to become strong To do this Britain needed to tax imports This was called Tariff Reform The government disagreed so Chamberlain resigned from the government He worked with other MPs to ask for Tariff Reform 

In 1906 just after his 70th birthday Chamberlain had a stroke that made him very sick He could not work hard so his son Austen Chamberlain helped him with his work He died of a heart attack on the 2nd July 1914

The city of Birmingham changed a lot because of Chamberlains work There are many places in Birmingham that have Chamberlains name Birmingham University which he helped to start has a clock tower with his name Chamberlain Square in the centre of Birmingham also has a memorial for him

Zack Wiki Quest for Barbaros Treasure is a video game made by Capcom in 2007 for the Wii game console

A pirate called Zack and a monkey called Wiki search for treasure and meet a pirate called Barbaros after their plane was destroyed Zack and Wiki agree to help him get his body back if he gives them his ship and treasure Throughout the journey Zack and Wiki collect pieces of his skeleton while solving puzzles and fighting enemies the most important being Captain Rose and her pirates After Zack and Wiki find all of Barbaros parts and revives him Barbaros betrays Zack and Wiki to keep his ship and treasure and returns to Treasure Island Zack Wiki and Johnny Style join forces with the Rose Rock Pirates and travel to Treasure Island Barbaros kidnaps Wiki to bring back his pirates while Zack and the Rose Rock Pirates are captured Zack breaks out and fights Barbaros rescues Wiki and the Rose Rock Pirates and escape in Barbaros ship They beat Barbaros and his giant robot when he chases them and is sucked into a black hole

Zack Wiki uses the Wii Remote by itself to play the game The Wii Remote is pointed at the screen and a star icon is shown The player uses the star to move to a spot he or she picks to pick up stuff or to check things The level is seen zoomed out from Zack The player can do many things to look around the level including zooming out more or zooming in The main goal of almost every level is to reach a treasure chest at the end most containing a part of Barbaros The player also has to get as many points or HirameQ as he or she can to rank the player on how well he or she did This is done by solving puzzles quickly and making as few mistakes as possible

When the player starts the game or ends a level he or she returns to the Sea Rabbits HQ There are eight things that can be done here The first thing is that the player can go to the map of the world and pick a level to go to After that the player can buy Platinum Tickets and Oracle Dolls have a rabbit go treasure hunting be taught how to do all the Wii Remote actions see his or her stats see all the treasure he or she has found hear rumors and check his or her progress on building Barbaros

Each item in the game has a special way to hold it For example when the player gets an umbrella he or she has to hold the Wii Remote like an umbrella There are dozens of different items and they are used on stuff around Zack and Wiki or as a tool to protect them An umbrella can protect Zack from rain while a key can be used to unlock a door These items can be found in every level and when they get picked up they are added to the players treasure list There is another group of items called Enemy Items which can only be gotten when Zack turns an enemy or creature into an item by shaking Wiki Some enemies can be changed while others can not The first enemies in the game the Centipede can be turned into an item called a Centisaw which can cut down trees Human looking creatures like Goons can be turned into totem poles also

Most levels have enemies in them They are often able to kill or capture Zack and Wiki while others are harmless and can be turned into items Each world ends with a boss level where the player has to either battle a boss or survive it to beat the level Zack Wiki has many parts where the player can get a game over The game does not have a health bar and falling in a pit of spikes or getting crushed is instant death and it makes the player have to start the level over unless he or she has a Platinum Ticket

Capcoms video of Zack Wiki at E3 in 2007 had a sound effect in it that sometimes plays when the player does something good The sound effect is the Islamic prayer Allahu Akbar and after The Council on American Islamic Relations complained Capcom removed the phrase

Zack Wiki received mostly positive reviews gaining a score of 87 on metacritic Praised for reviving the point and click genre IGN called it an unpredictably top quality undertaking whose winning marriage of sometimes genius environmental puzzles and beautiful graphics will suck you in

IGN gave Zack Wiki their Adventure Game of the Year 2007 award while Nintendo Power ranked it was 7th on their best Wii games list

A pendulum is a mass on an arm The arm is attached to a pivot which is a point to swing from The mass will naturally hang down because of gravity but if it is pushed to one side it will oscillate which means that it will swing from side to side The frequency of the swinging pendulum stays the same

Where is read pi Note that the period of a pendulum doesnt depend on the mass of the object

The mechanical energy of a pendulum is constant and is the sum of the kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy  

The regular motion of the pendulum can be used for time keeping and pendulums are used to regulate pendulum clocks

Pendulum is also the name of a band who play music which is a cross between Drum n Bass and Rock music This comment has nothing to do with the actual pendulum object

Finnix is a Debian based Live CD Linux distribution developed by Ryan Finnie and intended for system administrators for tasks such as filesystem recovery network monitoring and OS installation Finnix is a small Linux Distribution with an ISO download size of approximately 100 MiB

Finnix was created in 1999 making it one of the oldest Linux distributions with the intent of being run completely from a bootable CD Finnix 001 was based on Red Hat Linux 61 and was created to help with administration and recovery of other Linux workstations around Finnies office

On 23 October 2005 Finnix 860 was released Earlier unreleased versions were Knoppix remasters with support for Linux LVM and dm crypt being the main reason for creation However 860 was a departure from Knoppix and was derived directly from the Debian testing tree

Finnix is released as a small bootable CD ISO A user can download the ISO burn the image to CD and boot into a text mode Linux environment Finnix requires at least 32MiB RAM to run properly but can use more if present Most hardware devices are detected and dealt with automatically such as hard drives network cards and USB devices A user can modify files nearly anywhere on the running CD via UnionFS a filesystem that can stack a read write filesystem on top of a read only filesystem Any changes made during the Finnix session are transparently written to RAM and discarded upon shutdown In addition Finnix uses SquashFS to keep distribution size low

Finnix can be run completely within RAM provided the system has at least 192 MiB RAM available

The mandible is a bone found in all jawed vertebrates The name comes from Latin mandibula 

In bony fish the lower jaw is made of a number of bones but these were gradually reduced in evolution 

In humans and other mammals the mandible is simply the jawbone or dentary which is the largest and strongest bone of the face 

In mammals bones formerly in the lower jaw have become the ear ossicles

Homo heidelbergensis is an extinct species of the genus Homo It is perhaps the direct ancestor of Homo neanderthalensis in Europe Today some scientists beileve that the Neanderthal is not directly related to the modern man More likely they are related to hominins called Homo sapiens idaltu that migrated from Africa to Europe again The European forms of Homo heidelbergensis are therefore not thought to be direct ancestors of modern Homo sapiens Homo antecessor is likely a direct ancestor living 750000 years ago It might have evolved into Homo heidelbergensis It appeared in the fossil record living roughly 600000 to 250000 years ago in various areas of EuropeFactdateJuly 2007

Homo heidelbergensis remains were found in Mauer near Heidelberg Germany and then later in Arago France and Petralona Greece The best evidence found for these hominins date between 400000 and 500000 years ago 

H heidelbergensis stone tool technology was considerably close to that of the Acheulean tools used by Homo erectus The first fossil discovery of this species was made on October 21 1907 and came from Mauer where the workman Daniel Hartmann spotted a jaw in a sandpit The jaw was in good condition except for the missing premolar teeth which were eventually found near the jaw The workman gave it to professor Otto Schoetensack from the University of Heidelberg who identified and named the fossil

Most current experts believe that Rhodesian Man found in Africa belongs to the group Homo heidelbergensis

Both Homo antecessor and Homo heidelbergensis proably evolved from Homo ergaster from Africa Homo heidelbergensis had a much larger brain and more advanced tools It was therefore given its own species It was also very tall It was more muscular than the modern human

Cut marks on wild deer elephants rhinos and horses demonstrate that they were butchered Some of the animals weighed as much as 700 kg or more During this era now extinct wild animals such as mammoths European lions and Irish elk lived on the European continent

Recent findings in Atapuerca suggest that H heidelbergensis may have been the first species of the Homo genus to bury their dead This is however still discussed among scientists Some experts believe that H heidelbergensis like its descendant H neanderthalensis learened a primitive form of language No forms of art or sophisticated artifacts other than stone tools have been uncovered although red ochre a mineral that can be used to create a red pigment which is useful as a paint has been found at Terra Amata excavations in the south of France ImageHomo heidelbergensis Cranium 5jpgHomo heidelbergensis cranium ImageHeidelberger Mensch Replik RosensteinmuseumjpgCopy of the jawbone found in 1907

Silent barter is what is done when traders who cannot speak each other people language can trade without talking This was used in many parts of ancient Africa Silent bartering was mainly used during 500 AD to 1500 AD

To do a silent barter one group of traders would go to a certain location leaving whatever they are offering to trade The other group of traders would then decide if they would like to accept the goods that were left If the goods met with approval the second group would then take the goods leave their own goods in return and leave because the person accepted the offer This system of trading was used mostly in Ancient Ghana

This is an English pronunciation respelling key that may be used in Wikipedia articles By using a simpler spelling of words it helps readers of articles to learn how to pronounce words that they are not familiar with

If you have come here because a respelled pronunciation was used in an article look at the tables below to find out how to pronounce the word

The method is simple to understand because it does not use any special symbols except the schwa which represents the uh sound Another way of showing how to pronounce words is to use the International Phonetic Alphabet The IPA can be used to show the sounds in a word very accurately without ambiguity but it uses many special symbols that are not required in the respelling approach

Consonant sounds should be pronounced as shown below 

Vowel sounds should be pronounced as shown below

When a certain sound is pronounced by some speakers but not by others the sound is put inside parentheses It is correct to say the word either with or without the sound For example the respelled pronunciation of the word truism is TROO i zm It can either be pronounced TROO i zm or TROO i zm

A syllable is the smallest block of sound that a person can make when he or she speaks Words can have one or more syllables For example cat is a one syllable word tortoise has two syllables and dinosaur has three syllables In this system of respelled pronunciation the syllables in a word are separated by hyphens

When a word has more than one syllable some syllables are usually given more emphasis than others when the word is spoken In linguistics this emphasis is called stress The stress in a word is shown by writing the syllable in SMALL CAPITAL LETTERS

In a long word with many syllables different types of stress are often given to different syllables Linguists can tell the difference between heavier primary stress and lighter secondary stress To keep things simple this respelled pronunciation system does not show the difference between these two types of stress Readers can usually work out for themselves where the primary and secondary stresses should be

Massacres of Foibe are referred to in the context of mass killings in which the majority of victims were ethnic Italians Such carnages were committed in 1943 after the capitulation of Italy on 8 September and in 1945 when Yugoslav partisans under the command of the Yugoslav communist leader Tito occupied parts of Venezia Giulia Istria and Dalmatia Almost all historians of various nations have claimed this bloodshed and consequent Italian Istrian Dalmatian exodus were a genocide or holocaust and a planned ethnic cleansing of innocent civilians

National Memorial Day of the Exiles and Foibe is Italian celebration in memory of all victims murdered and survived Number of killed Italian citizens The estimate is about 30000 killed Italian citizens According to a report issued in 2000 by a mixed Slovene Italian historical commission established in 1993 the number of people missing from the region most of whom finished in the foibe alias local geological clefts range from 1300 to 1600 but this estimate does not include those killed in current Croatian territory Some of them were court martialed fascists or enemy soldiers but many civilian persons were also killed The great majority of the persons killed were of Italian nationality 

The killings beginning after the capitulation of Italy in 1943 and the massacres of 1945 occurred partly under conditions of guerrilla fighting of Slovenian and Croatian partisans with the German and remaining Italian Fascist forces and partially after the occupation of the territory by the army formations of Yugoslavia Killings may have included war crimes as well as civilian crimes of private or political retaliation as well as political cleansing and planned ethnic cleansing since 1947 Also Italian communists with Slav partisans killed Italian people in addition to the foibe several other carnages committed by Italian communist partisans under Palmiro Togliattis command in the resistance movement have remained unacknowledged and undiscussed for many years

Victims were not all Italians because many killed citizen were anticommunist Croats and Slovens many women were raped before killing Historians like Raoul Pupo or Roberto Spazzali estimated the total number of victims at about 5000 Guido Rumici calculates from 11000 upwards including all people died in concentration campsGiampaolo Pansa calculates around 15000 always including all people died in concentration camps fascist politician and historian Giorgio Pisan calculated total from 10000 upwardsIt was never possible to extract all the thousands of corpses from foibes because some of them are deeper than several hundreds meters Until few years ago it had been able to extract from the pits just a small number of bodies less than six hundred while other sources are attempting to compile lists of locations and possible victim numbersAlmost all historians calculate hundreds of victims real assassinated by hard pushes to foibe while the estimated number of total people killed in concentration camps is disputed and varies in thousandsprobably only a part of total cadavers was hided in foibe but a lot of bodies were accumulated in mass graves Main concentration camps were in Borovnica Skofja Loka Osijek Stara Gradiska Sisak Zemun Vrsac Osseh Aidussina Maribor

No investigation of the crimes had been initiated either by Italy Yugoslavia or any international bodies until after Slovenia became an independent country in 1991 Italian Slovene relations in the relevant period have been under intensive study by historians since 1990 A joint report by a commission of historians from both countries was published under the auspices of the two governments in the year 2000 The report puts the Italian Slovenian relations in a wider context It touches also on the question of mass killings associated with the foibe As no exact count was ascertained the report includes a wording of hundreds of victims referring to the territory relevant for Italo Slovenian relations and thus excluding the Croatian territories

Even since Slovenia joined the European Union the relations between the two nations are a matter of political debate The debate gained high visibility after the Italian Parliament under Prime Minister Berlusconi and his coalition partners of centre right provenance made 10 February a National Memorial Day of the Exiles and Foibe first celebrated in Trieste in 2005 The 2005 celebration of the Memorial Day was accompanied by an RAI TV movie production The Heart in the Pit  The movie was viewed by 17 million spectators on its first broadcasting in Italy alone 

Many Italians were forced to leave the country after massacres Economic insecurity fear of further retaliation and the change of regime that eventually led to the Iron Curtain splitting the Trieste Istria region resulted in approximately 350000 people mostly Italians leaving territories in Istria and Dalmatia The inhabitants of territories that were under Italian rule since World War I according to the Treaty of Rapallo of 1920 later assigned to Yugoslavia by the Paris Peace Treaty of 1947 02 10 and the London Memorandum of 1954 were given a choice of opting to leave or staying These exiles were to be given compensation for their loss of property and other indemnity by the Italian state under the terms of the peace treaties

On February 18 1983 Yugoslavia and Italy signed a treaty in Rome where Yugoslavia agreed to pay 110 million USD for the compensation of the exiles property which was confiscated after the war By its breakup in 1991 Yugoslavia paid 18 million USD Slovenia and Croatia two Yugoslav successors agreed to share the remainder of this debt Slovenia assumed 62 and Croatia the remaining 38 Italy did not want to reveal the bank account number so in 1994 Slovenia opened a fiduciary account at Dresdner Bank in Luxembourg informed Italy about it and started paying its 55976930 USD share The last payment was paid in January 2002 Until today Croatia hopes for a different solution of this matter and has not paid a dollar yet The Italian side has not withdrawn a single dollar from the account yet

In 1992 Italian judge Giuseppe Pittitto started a criminal trial after a complaint against suspected Slav criminals of war Oscar Piskulic and Ivan Motika were both principal accused but they were discharged because territorial jurisdiction was rejected and they received acquittal under the amnesty of 1959 In 1997 some Italian deputies pressed their government for extradition of suspected Slav criminals but diplomatic problems stopped Italian action All Italian historians consider Josip Broz Tito the chief of Slav criminals but his corpse still stays in a mausoleum

Report of the Italian Slovene commission of historians

The expression Istrian Dalmatian exodus is used to indicate the diaspora or forced migration of ethnic Italians from Istria Fiume and Dalmatia after World War IIThose territories were ethnically mixed since the Middle Ages with Italian Slovenian Croatian Serbian and other communities

National Memorial Day of the Exiles and Foibe is Italian celebration in memory of all exiles and victims in massacres of Foibe murdered and survived 

Istria including Rijeka and parts of Dalmatia including Zadar had been annexed to Italy after World War I At the end of World War II the former Italian territories in Istria and Dalmatia became part of Yugoslavia by the Paris Peace Treaty with the only exception being the communes of Muggia and San Dorligo della Valle 

Italian sources claim that about 350000 ethnic Italians had to leave the areas in the aftermath of the conflict Official data shows that between 1948 and 1961 the numbers of ethnic Italians living in Slovenia  almost exclusively in Slovenian Istria and along the Italian border  actually decreased by nearly 87 The data for the Former Yugoslavia shows a decrease in the same years from 113278 to 25615 According to Slovenian historian Matja Klemeni in 1953 only 36000 lived in the region of former Yugoslavia ie 16 of the Italian population before World War II Italians also emigrated in later decades Therefore their population declined in each subsequent census until 1981 We have to emphasize that the data of the Yugoslav census are unrealiable in relation to the real number if Italians since many members of the Italian minority for various reasons chose Nationality Undeclared or their regional identity In the 1991 census there was a relatively large increase of Italians compared to 1981 census Many Italians who in previous census did not declare as such declared themselves Italians in 1991 because they counted on the help of Italy in forthcoming crises in the region

In various municipalities in Croatia in Slovenia census data shows that there are still significant numbers of Italians living in Istria such as 66 of the population of Gronjan 41 at Brtonigla and nearly 40 in Buje

The Italians in Slovenia and Croatia were mostly an indigenous population bolstered by new arrivals or the so called regnicoli never well liked by the indigenous Venetian speaking Istrians who arrived between 1918 1943 when Primorska and Istria Rijeka part of Dalmatia and the islands of Cres Krk Lastovo and Palagrua were part of Italy Austrian 1910 census indicated approximately 182500 people who listed Italian as their language of communication in what is now the territory of Slovenia and Croatia 137131 in Istria 28911 in FiumeRijeka 11487 in ZaraZadar 5000 in Dalmatia while the Italian 1936 census indicated approximately 230000 people who listed Italian as their language of communication in what is now the territory of Slovenia and Croatia then part of the Italian state From the end of World War II until 1953 according to various data between 250000 and 350000 people emigrated from these regions One third were Slovenes and Croats who opposed the Communist government in Yugoslavia while two thirds were ethnic Italians the so called optanti emigrants who were living permanently in this region on 10 June 1940 and who expressed their wish to obtain Italian citizenship and emigrate to Italy The emigration of Italians reduced the total population of the region and altered its ethnic structure

In 1953 officially only 36000 Italians lived in Yugoslavia 16 of the Italian population before World War II In its 1996 report on Local self government territorial integrity and protection of minorities the Council of Europes European Commission for Democracy through Law put it that a great majority of the local Italians Italianites many thousands of Slovenes and of nationally undefined bilingual Istrians used their legal right from the peace treaty to opt out of the Yugoslav controlled part of Istria In several waves they moved to Italy and elsewhere and claimed Italian or other citizenship The mass exodus of the optanti from godless communist Yugoslavia was actively encouraged by the Italian authorities Italian radio and the Roman Catholic bishop of Trieste After this huge drain the numerical strength of the remaining Italian minority became stable

Evidence of Italic people living alongside those from other ethnic groups on the eastern side of the Adriatic as far north as the Alps goes back at least to the Bronze Age and the populations have been mixed ever since A 2001 population census counted 23 languages spoken by the people of Istria 

From the Middle Ages onwards numbers of Slavic people near and on the Adriatic coast were ever increasing due to their expanding population and due to pressure from the Turks pushing them from the south and east This led to Italic people becoming ever more confined to urban areas while the countryside was populated by Slavs with certain isolated exceptions 

The majority Slavic population suffered economic and political disadvantages which gradually declined with the democratization of the Austro Hungarian empire in the 19th century 

In 1915 the Italians attacked the Austro Hungarian Empire leading to bloody conflict mainly on the Isonzo and Piave fronts Britain France and Russia had been keen to bring neutral Italy into World War One on their side Italy however drove a hard bargain demanding extensive territorial concessions once the war had been won In a deal to draw Italy into the war under the London Pact Italy was granted Trentino Trieste South Tyrol and Istria including large non Italian communities But Dalmatia was excluded as was Rijeka In Dalmatia not granted to Italy by the London pact Italy gained the city of Zadar and some islands

After World War I under the Treaty of Rapallo between the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes and the Kingdom of Italy Italy obtained almost all of Istria with Trieste the exception being the island of Krk and part of Kastav commune which went to the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes By the Treaty of Rome the Free state of RijekaFiume was split between Italy and Yugoslavia

After the Wehrmacht invasion of Yugoslavia the Italian zone of occupation was further expanded Italy annexed large areas of Croatia and Slovenia Its brutal repression of Partisan activities and the killing and imprisonment of thousands of Yugoslav civilians in concentration camps in the newly annexed provinces and in Italy proper fed the anti Italian sentiments of the Slovenian and Croatian subjects of Fascist Italy During the Italian occupation until their capitulation in September 1943 the population was subjected to atrocities described by Italian historian Claudio Pavone as aggressive and violent Not so much an eye for an eye as a head for an eye as orders by Italian generals explicitely called

After the Second World War there were large scale movements of people choosing to move to Italy rather than live in Yugoslavia In Yugoslavia the people who left were called optanti which translates as choosers while they call themselves esuli or exiles Their motives for leaving may have been fear of reprisals economic motives or ethnically based

When the Fascist regime collapsed in 1943 reprisals against Italian fascists took place At least 200 Italians were killed by Titos resistance movement in September 1943 some had been connected to the fascist regime while others were victims of personal hatred or the attempt of the partisan resistance to get rid of its real or supposed enemies These events took place in central and eastern Istria as well as in Slovenian Primorska The second wave of anti Fascist violence took place after occupation of Slav army in May 1945 This was known as the foibe massacres actually it was a reenaction of what had been already began in 1943 

Many Italian sources claim that these killings amounted to ethnic cleansing and genocide then Italian people was forced to migration 

The mixed Italian Slovenian Historical Commission established in 1995 by the two governments to investigate the matters succinctly described the circumstances of the 1945 killings

The number of victims is not certain The Italian historian Raoul Pupo suggests 4500 were killed mostly Italians but many bodies wearing Partisan uniforms were found as well so the number is subject to many interpretations Other sources suggest numbers reaching up to 20000 killed or missing

Economic insecurity ethnic hatred and the international political context that eventually led to the Iron Curtain resulted in approximately 350000 people mostly Italians choosing to leave the region The London Memorandum of 1954 gave to the ethnic Italians the choice of either opting to leave or staying These exiles were to be given compensation for their loss of property and other indemnity by the Italian state under the terms of the peace treaties Following the exodus the areas were settled with Yugoslav people

The exodus took place between 1943 and 1960 Italians allege that most of their numbers left in 

The first period took place after the surrender of the Italian army and the beginning of the first wave of anti fascist violence

The second period was soon after the end of the war and approximately around the time of the second wave of anti fascist violence The Wehrmacht was engaged in a front wide retreat from the Yugoslav Partisans along with the local collaborationist forces 

The third period took place after the Paris peace treaty when Istria was assigned to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia except for a small area in the northwest part that formed the independent Free Territory of Trieste The fourth period took place after the Memorandum of Understanding in London It gave provisional civil administration of Zone A to Italy and Zone B to Yugoslavia in 1975 the Treaty of Osimo finally divided the former Free Territory of Trieste

Several estimates of the exodus by historians

The mixed Italian Slovenian Historical Commission verified 27000 Italian and 3000 Slovene migrants from Slovenian territory

Famous exiles In the list are persons who worked in other places before the war and are also considered exiles due to their properties being confiscated by the communist dictatorship under Josip Broz Famous postwar exiles from territories include

On February 18 1983 Yugoslavia and Italy signed a treaty in Rome where Yugoslavia agreed to pay US110 million for the compensation of the exiles property which was confiscated after the war in the Zone B of Free Territory of Trieste Up to its breakup in 1991 Yugoslavia had paid US18 million Slovenia and Croatia two Yugoslav successors agreed to share the remainder of this debt Slovenia assumed 62 and Croatia the remaining 38 Italy did not want to reveal the bank account number so in 1994 Slovenia opened a fiduciary account at Dresdner Bank in Luxembourg informed Italy about it and started paying its US55976930 share The last payment was due in January 2002 Until today the solution of the matter between Croatia and Italy has been delayed None of the refugees from the Free Territory of Trieste saw a single penny so far

It has been established that foibe massacres were been used by Slav communists for ethnic political cleansing In fact foibe massacres and exodus were described as a democide and an ethnic political cleansing by Italian president Giorgio Napolitano

Italian cultural and historic presence in Dalmatia is related to the Italian influence in Dalmatia from the historical and cultural points of view 

The historical influence from the Italian peninsula in Dalmatia started with the Roman conquest of Illyrian Dalmatia The historian Theodore Mommsen stated in his book History of Rome that all Dalmatia was fully Romanised and Latin speaking by the fourth century

The actual Dalmatians may in part trace their origins back to the Romanised Illyrians during the Barbarian Invasions of the fifth and sixth centuries when Avars with some Slavs invaded Illyria This invasion opened the way to the settlement of different Slavic tribes 

During those years the original Latin population took refuge in the coastal cities and in the islands whilst other migrated to the mountains So in the early Middle ages the coastal area of Dalmatia retained its original latinised culture mainly on the islands and cities such as Zara Spalato Ragusa and Cattaro These cities maintained deep cultural and commercial links with the Italian mainland thanks to intense commerce through the Adriatic sea

Starting from the tenth century the Republic of Venice imposed its influence on Dalmatia gradually assimilating the neolatin Dalmatians while the local Slavs maintained their language

The Republic of Venice controlled most of Dalmatia from 1420 to 1797 During that period part of its Slavic population was italianised The Venetian possessions were called Venetian Dalmatia and enjoyed a flourishing period of economic bonanza with huge development of the arts and culture Dalmatia was greatly influenced by the Italian Renaissance and many buildings churches and cathedrals were done in those years from Zara and Spalato to Sebenik and Ragusa 

In these centuries the Venetian language became the lingua franca of all Dalmatia assimilating the Dalmatian language of the Romanised Illyrians and influencing partially the coastal Croatian language and the Albanian language 

Zara was the capital of the Venetian Dalmatia a role that has maintained through the successive centuries In those centuries the most southern area of Dalmatia was called Albania veneta now called coastal Montenegro 

After the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797 to the Napoleon Armies the Dalmatia was incorporated briefly in the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy In those years the scholastic system was expanded to all the population and the Italian language was instituted as the official language in the schools of Dalmatia

When Austria occupied Dalmatia there was a revival of the Slav people inside Dalmatia The Italian population that was nearly one third of the Dalmatians in the second half of the XVIII century according to the Austrian census decreased from 22 in 1816 to 125 in 1853 and a mere 29 in 1910 

After WWI Italy obtained Zara and some northern Dalmatian islands During WWII the Kingdom of Italy annexed to the newly created Governatorato di Dalmazia most of Dalmatia In 1942 there were 4020 Italians in these newly annexed areas 2220 in Spalato 300 in Sebenico 500 Cattaro and 1000 Veglia Furthermore there were in the Governatorato 10000 Italians who took the Yugoslav citizenship after WWI in order to remain there and be accepted without problems by the new Yugoslavian regime after the fall of the Austro Hungarian Empire

After WWII Italy lost all the territories in Dalmatia and more than 22000 Dalmatian Italians exiled mainly in Italy There are still some Dalmatian Italians in Dalmatia 300 in Croatia and 500 in Montenegro

That means that in only one hundred years the Dalmatian Italians decreased from 45000 in the 1857 Austrian Census to less than one thousand in the last Croatian and Montenegrin Census

The cultural influence from the Italian peninsula is extremely important in Dalmatia since the Roman times It has increased to influence totally the dalmatian culture during the times of the Republic of Venice and the Italian Renaissance 

Indeed the British Encyclopedia states that the monuments left in Dalmatia by the Romans are numerous and precious They are chiefly confined to the cities for the civilization of the country was always urban just as its history is a record of isolated city states rather than of a united nation Beyond the walls of its larger towns little was spared by the barbarian Goths Avars and Slavs and the battered fragments of Roman work which mark the sites of Salona near Spalato and of many other ancient cities are of slight antiquarian interest and slighter artistic value Among the monuments of the Roman period by far the most noteworthy in Dalmatia and indeed in the whole Balkan Peninsula is the Palace of Diocletian at Spalato Dalmatian architecture was influenced by Constantinople in its general character from the 6th century until the close of the tenth The oldest memorials of this period are the vestiges of three basilicas excavated in Salona and dating from the first half of the 7th century at latest Then from Italy came the Romanesque The belfry of S Maria at Zara erected in 1105 is first in a long list of Romanesque buildings At Arbe there is a beautiful Romanesque campanile which also belongs to the 12th century but the finest example in this style is the cathedral of Trail The 14th century Dominican and Franciscan convents in Ragusa are also noteworthy Romanesque lingered on in Dalmatia until it was displaced by Venetian Gothic in the early years of the 15th century The influence of Venice was then at its height Even in the relatively hostile republic of Ragusa the Romanesque of the custom house and Rectors palace is combined with Venetian Gothic while the graceful balconies and ogee windows of the Prijeki closely follow their Venetian models In 1441 Giorgio Orsini of Zara summoned from Venice to design the cathedral of Sebenico brought with him the influence of the Italian Renaissance The new forms which he introduced were eagerly imitated and developed by other architects until the period of decadence  which virtually concludes the history of Dalmatian art  set in during the latter half of the 17th century Special mention must be made of the carved woodwork embroideries and plate preserved in many churches The silver statuette and the reliquary of St Biagio at Ragusa and the silver ark of St Simeon at Zara are fine specimens of Italian jewellers work ranging in date from the 11th or 12th to the 17th century 

In the XIX century the cultural influence from Italy originated the creation in Zara of the first dalmatian newspaper edited in Italian and Croat Il Regio Dalmata  Kraglski Dalmatin It was founded and published by the Italian Bartolomeo Benincasa in 1806

The Regio Dalmata  Kraglski Dalmatin was stamped in the tipography of Antonio Luigi Battara and was the first done in Croat language

The cultural influence from Italy is clearly evident in the urbanization plans of the main Dalmatian cities in the XIXXX centuries One of the best examples is the one of SplitSpalato 

In 1880 Antonio Bajamonti developed an urbanization project of this city centered on the Riva a seaside walkway full of palms based on the Italian Riviera models Even today the Riva is used by the locals to stroll in a typical Italian way from the Palace of Diocletian toward an old square called locally Pjaca

Even in music the Italian influence was very strong in Dalmatia 

An enduring example of the Italian cultural and historic presence in Dalmatia is the small town of Perasto in coastal Montenegro 

Perasto was at its peak in the 18th century under the Republic of Venice when it had as many as four active shipyards a fleet of around one hundred ships and 1643 residents At that time the most beautiful buildings arose in this fortified town Many ornate baroque palaces and magnificent dwelling houses decorated the town of Perast full of typical venetian architecture Perasto had the privilege to keep war flag of the Venetian Navy in the peace time 

The sailormen of Perasto were involved in the last battle of the Venitian navy fought in Venice in 1797

At the fall of the Serenissima Perasto was the last city of the Repubblic to lower the Venetian flag On 12 May 1797 the Republic of Venice ended but a few places in the Albania veneta for several months still continued to remain loyal to the Venetian Repubblic Perasto was the last place of the Republic to surrender On 22 August 1797 the Count Giuseppe Viscovich Captain of Perasto lowered the Venetian war flag of the Lion of Saint Mark pronouncing the farewell words in front of the crying people of the city and buried the Gonfalon of Venice under the altar of the main church of Perasto

The population has since decreased to 430 in 1910 and around 360 today According to the Comunita nazionale italiana del Montenegro in Perast actually there are 140 persons who still speak at home the original venetian dialect of Perasto and call themselves in the census Montenegrins

A frugivore is an animal that prefers to eat fruit 

The fruit is part of a plants sexual reproduction cycle Plants spend a lot of energy and nutrients in creating fruit Fruit is produced to attract animals into eating the fruit The animal digests the pulp but not the seeds ensuring the plants genes are spread wherever the animal goes Seeds can also be germinated by falling near the mother plant Some seeds must pass through the digestive system before they can germinate 

Frugivores have also evolved in different ways to eat different fruit some use teeth others long beaks or short beaks

Many birds eat both fruits and insects which makes them omnivores Mammals may eat both fruits and protein or eat mostly fruit or nectar such as many bats One primate group is essentially herbivorefrugivore the Owl Monkeys They live in a non seasonal area of the Amazon that supports a constant supply of fruiting trees Elsewhere an exclusively frugivore diet is impossible and is supplemented by insects or rougher plant matter Some people say that humans are frugivores this is unlikely given the evolution of man in the dry tropical region of the Rift Valley That said almost all primates and even carnivores will travel great distances to feast when a fruit tree has dropped its ripened fruit Many species will remember the exact fruiting date and location of a fruiting tree which highlights fruits great nutritional benefit promote a frugivore diet

The Italian language is the third most spoken language in the Republic of Croatia today It is an officially recognized minority language in Istria County

The 2001 census in Croatia reported 19636 ethnic Italians in the country Ethnologue reported 70000 speakers in 1998 40000 ethnic Italians and 30000 ethnic Croats and Istrian people Native Italian speakers are largely concentrated along the Adriatic coast In addition roughly 120000 Italian tourists visit Croatia each year so many in the service and tourist industries have some knowledge of the language

Historically the language had a much larger population than it does now Italians have lived on the Adriatic coast for hundreds of years and Istria was part of the Kingdom of Italy from 1919 until 1947 However the Istrian exodus after the Second World War and Yugoslavian ethnic cleansing in the form of the Foibe massacres forced the greater part of the Istrian Italians to flee to Italy During the italian exodu about 350000 people left Istria Dalmatia and the isles of Croatia

Government services are provided in Italian and Croatian in Istria County including the official government website There are four Italian language schools in Istria primary schools in Buje and Novigrad and secondary schools in Pula and Rovinj

Objectivism is a philosophy that was started by Ayn Rand It has four main ideas

1 Everything that exists has an identity This identity does not depend on how people think about it or talk about it This is also true for things like feelings or ideas It says that a thing is the thing which it is or A is A

2 Reason is how a person knows that what he thinks or believes is true A person cannot make something true just by wanting it to be true or by mysticism Only rational logical thinking can produce the best outcome This means recognizing that a thing is the thing it is and to not confuse it with things which it is not

3 It is good to be happy and it is good for a person to try to be happy People should always try to improve their lives and be happy in the long term so that they are happy now and in the future People should not hurt others to try to be happy but they also should not hurt themselves to try to make other people happy People should also not make themselves less happy to help something like God Ayn Rand called this rational self interest

4 If governments or criminals take things away from people or try to make people do things they do not want to do it does damage to everybody Ayn Rand thought that governments should only be able to protect people from violence theft fraud and other actions that go against peoples rights This includes laissez faire capitalism and is sometimes called libertarianism

She first told people these ideas in her novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged She talked about them more in The Objectivist Newsletter The Objectivist The Ayn Rand Letter Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology and The Virtue of Selfishness

Konrad Zacharias Lorenz was an Austrian zoologist naturalist ornithologist and Nobel Prize winner He is one of the founders of studies on animal behaviour Lorenz studied instinctive behavior in animals especially in Greylag geese and jackdaws

In his autobiographical essay published in 1973 in Les Prix Nobel Lorenz said that his parents were the main reason he was so successful He also said that a book by Selma Lagerlof called The Wonderful Adventures of Nils that he read as a child was the reason he became interested in wild geese

Lorenz began his studies in 1922 at Columbia University but he returned to Vienna in 1923 to continue his studies at the University of Vienna until 1928 At this university he became an assistant professor from 1928 to 1935 In 1936 Lorenz met his great friend and colleague Niko Tinbergen Together they studied geese wild domestic and hybrid

In 1940 Lorenz became a professor of psychology at the University of Knigsberg He was drafted into the Wehrmacht in 1941 He tried to become a motorcycle mechanic but instead he was assigned as a medic He was a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union from 1942 to 1948 During this time he continued to work as a medical doctor and got quite friendly with some Russians mostly doctors When he was sent back home after the war he was allowed to keep both the manuscript of the book he had been writing and his pet starling He arrived back in Altenberg with manuscript and bird intact The manuscript became his book Behind the Mirror 

Lorenz shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries in individual and social behavior patterns with two other important early ethologists Niko Tinbergen and Karl von Frisch In 1969 he became the first person to receive the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca

Lorenz retired from the Max Planck Institute in 1973 but continued to research and publish from his family home in Austria Konrad Lorenz died on 27 February 1989 in Altenberg

Lorenz joined the Nazi Party in 1938 and accepted a university position under Nazi Germany In his application for membership to the Nazi party NSDAP he wrote in 1938 Im able to say that my whole scientific work is devoted to the ideas of the National Socialists 

When he accepted the Nobel Prize in 1973 Lorenz apologized for a 1940 publication that included Nazi views of science saying that many highly decent scientists hoped like I did for a short time that National Socialism would produce good results and many quickly turned away from it with the same horror as I did

Together with Niko Tinbergen Lorenz formed the idea of an innate releasing mechanism to explain instinctive behaviors Building on the ideas of William McDougall Lorenz developed this into a psychohydraulic explanation of the motives of behavior Another contribution is his work on imprinting His influence on a younger generation of ethologists as well as his books were important in bringing ethology to the attention of the general public

Lorenz predicted that market economics could eventually destroy Earths ecosystem In his 1973 book Civilized Mans Eight Deadly Sins Lorenz considered the following paradox 

Lorenz adopts an ecological model to attempt to explain how this contradiction can exist

In nature these mechanisms tend towards a stable state among the living beings of an ecology 

Lorenz states that humanity is the only species that is not forced to abide by these mechanisms as humans are the only species that has the ability to change its own environment The pace of human ecology is determined by the progress of mans technology Not only that but human ecology is governed by mechanisms of positive feedback defined as a mechanism which tends to encourage behavior rather than to discourage it p43 

Lorenz does not see human independence from natural ecological processes as necessarily bad Indeed he states that a completely new ecology which corresponds in every way to humanitys desires could theoretically prove as durable as that which would have existed without his intervention p36 However the principle of competition typical of Western societies destroys any chance of this 

In this book Lorenz proposes that the best hope for mankind lies in our looking for mates based on the kindness of their hearts rather than good looks or wealth

In his 1973 book Behind the Mirror a search for a natural history of human knowledge Lorenz considers an old philosophical question Do our senses actually tell us about the world as it is Or do they only give us an illusion Lorenz answer comes from evolutionary biology Only things that help a species to survive and reproduce are kept Anything that does not benefit a species is quickly removed through the process of natural selection Lorenz argued that if our senses gave us wrong information about our environment humanity would soon be extinct Therefore we can be sure that our senses give us correct information for otherwise we would not be here to be deceived

Lorenzs best known books are King Solomons RingKing Solomons Ring and On Aggression both written for a popular audience His scientific work appeared mainly in journal articles written in German they became widely known to English speaking scientists through the descriptions of it in Tinbergens 1951 book The Study of Instinct though many of his papers were later published in English translation in the two volumes titled Studies in Animal and Human Behavior

Pikmin got good reviews and is considered one of the best GameCube launch games Reviewers liked its strategic gameplay but a lot complained about the time limit saying it made it harder to play the game outside of the main task

The Planet Hocotate has many locations types of locations including a and resembles Earth but from the perspective of an insect because Olimar and Louie are actually smaller than a quarter The levels have many objects from the real world like a Duracell battery and an RC Cola pop cap A level in Super Smash Bros Brawl is based on this planet 

The gameplay is mostly the same as Pikmins Olimar and Louie control the Pikmin and they can use them to pick up objects reach other areas and fight enemies Pikmin are plucked out of the ground and they live in a space ship called an onion when they are not being used There can be up to 100 different Pikmin out of the onion and there are five kinds of Pikmin  the first three from Pikmin are the Red Pikmin Yellow Pikmin and Blue Pikmin The Red Pikmin are stronger and can not be burnt the Yellow Pikmin are lighter can pick up bombs and can not be electrocuted and the Blue Pikmin can swim Pikmin 2 adds two new Pikmin  Purple Pikmin and White Pikmin The Purple Pikmin are the strongest and the heaviest and the White Pikmin are poison and kill enemies if eaten These Pikmin can be thrown into the air to reach a higher place and can be guided to get them all in one spot One new feature Pikmin 2 adds is the ability to switch between two leaders  Olimar and Louie

Music from Pikmin 2 including the song Tane no Uta was used in Super Smash Bros Brawl

Pikmin 2 got great reviews and rates much higher than the original Pikmin Many reviewers were glad that Nintendo got rid of the 30 day time limit from Pikmin as well as the treasures based on real life objects Reviewers were split on the Underground areas some liking the challenge while others saying its boring or too hard

A steam locomotive is a type of steam engine used on railways It was used a lot between about 1830 and 1970 Afterwards diesel and electric locomotives were used more often The first steam locomotive was made by Richard Trevithick for a railway used for moving iron at an ironworks in Wales A steam locomotive works by burning a fuel like coal in a special space called a firebox This produces hot gases that rise and go through tubes in a boiler  a large space with water in it This heats the water producing steam The steam is then taken through another tube to a cylinder The steam then pushes the piston which in turn pushes a metal rod that is connected to the wheels making the locomotive move The steam then rises out through the chimney

Steam locomotives are still today used in many developing countries where the railways have not yet been electrified

Exactly who were the first Muslims to set foot in the Indian subcontinent is not known but it may be that Muslim traders from the coastlands of Arabia and the Persian Gulf touched at ports along the western coast of the Indian peninsula and in Ceylon very soon after the rise of the new faith in the early 7th century AD

The first historical data tells of Arab troops fired by the great excess of Islamic religious enthusiasm which had just overthrown the Sassanid Empire in Persia raiding into what is now Pakistans Balochistan province the coastal region of the provincial area was even in early Islamic times known as Makran and its aridity and sparse population then as now made it a formidable barrier to Moslem penetration overland to the Indus Valley communications here have always been much easier by the Arabian Sea Exploratory raids into Makran from Fars and Kirman are mentioned from the Caliphate of Uthman onwards but no lasting political authority was established over the very few settlements of the interior We know virtually nothing of the ethnography or religious poistion of the indigenous population there although it is very likely that the present day Baloch people did not arrive until the 10th or 11th centuries Some of these forays reached the Indus Valley but the 1st permanent foothold of Islam was achieved during the opening yrs of the 8th century during the Caliphate of al Walid bin Abd al Malik a reign which saw other Muslim victories in Places as far as Spain and Central Asian states About the yr 711 a youthful Arab general called Muhammad bin Qasim al Thaqafi was deputed by the great governor of Iraq and the East al Hajjaj bin Yusuf to lead an expedition from Shiraz in southern Iran against Sindh The Islamic historian al Yaqubi states that al Hajjaj encouraged Muhammad bin Qasim al Thaqafi and the general commanding the Arab troops in Central Asia to make simulataneous attacks as the two prongs of a grand pincer movement against the Chinese empire and the Far East In the light of the spectacular successes already achsieved by the Arabs such dreams were by no means impossible Muhammad bin Qasim al Thaqafis force comprised 6000 Syrian Arab tribesmen and the operation was carefully planned It moved through Makran securing the towns there as it passed

We are ill formed about the state of Sindh on the eve of Arab invasion The ruler is named as King Dahir son of Chach According to the 13th century Persian chronicle the Chach Nama he ruled over a vast empire extending as far as Kashmir and modern Uttar Pradesh in the east In reality he seems to have had much more modest kingdom comprising lower and middle Sindh as far north as the town of Rur with his capital at Brahmanabad and his principal port at Daibul on the Indus River Delta The Islamic sources say that after Muhammad Bin Qasims conquest a number of local Indian princes in Sindh became vassals of the Caliphate so that Dahirs unitary state there may only have been a temporaray achievement and fragmentation the norm The dominant religion in Sindh at this time was Buddhism since the Arabs gave the name budd to every idol and temple which they found there and they used the title samani for the representatives of the local people with whom they negotiated but Brahmanism or Hinduism which was at this time gaining over Buddhism only in the Pakistan region Daibul fell to the Arab besiegers in 711 and its great Buddhist stupa whence Daibul or in Arabic manarat al budd was overthrown Magnanimous in the hour of victory Muhammad bin Qasim offered quarter to the local people he then proceeded to found the first mosque ever to be built on the soil of the Indian subcontinent and settled 4000 Arab families in a new section of the town He then led his army against Niran whose priests surrendered the town peacefully and against Sadusan The Arab ranks were swollen by the addition of 4000 Zutt or Jat auxiliaries the Indus was crossed by a bridge of boats and a final confrontation with Dahir and his host took place in 712 near Rawar Dahir was killed off and his army scattered after which the Arabs occupied the capital Brahmanabad Having secured that vital point the Arabs forces pushed northwards and captured Rur Finally the liberating Army penertrated as far as Multan the goal set by al Hajjaj in his instructions to his subordinate and after a lengthy siege Multan and its famous golden shrine bait al dhahab to the sun god Aditya with all its treasures fell into Muslim hands Multan was for 3 centuries to mark the northermost point of the Muslim advance in Sindh the story of the Chach Nama that Muhammad bin Qasim conquered as far as Kashmir can hardly be true within the occupied towns Muhammmad bin Qasim established a social and religious framework of life which refelected the early Islamic policy of tolerance The conqueror proclaimed the general principle of freedom of religion allowing Buddhists and Hindus to be included among the People of the Book or Protected Peoples as Jews and Christians had always been and as the Zoroastrians of Persia had become This tolerance was dictated no doubt partly by expediency The Muslims in Sindh were a tiny minority in a sea of alien potentially hostile non Muslims The process whereby Islam became the majority faith in Sindh extended over many centuries to date Pakistan and Kashmir has been a Islamic nation for over 1200 years Muhammad bin Qasim fell from power and was martyred when the new Caliph Sulaiman came to the throne in 715 but his pioneer work of carving a foothold in the subcontinent for Islam hd been well done It is true that the impetus of spectacular military expansion was spent for some three centuries and that Sindh became a peripheral province of the Caliphate where the power of the central government in Damascus or Baghdad was felt only intermittently but the Muslim community in Sindh put down strong roots further contingents of Arab settlers probably arrived to reinforceb the original colonists and Islam dwelt there at peace with the indigenous faiths until the next great wave of expansion under the Ghaznavids in the 11th century The Italian scholar F Gabrieli has justly said that present day Pakistan holding the values of Islam and Arabism in such high esteem should look upon the luckless Arab conqueror Muhammad bin Qasim almost as distant ktistes a hero of Indian Islam

Not a great deal is known about the subsequent history of the Arab presence in Sindh Governors were sent out periodically by the Caliphs and after 750 by the new dynasty of Abbasids in Iran Until the 9th century these governors continued to forward tribute to the Caliphate for it is recorded that in 820 under al Mamun the revenue sent amounted to 1000000 dirhams Being so remote from the centre of power Sindh became a favourite refuge for rebels and sectarians who could flee there quite by sea from the Gulf Control over the local Indian rulers was probably intermittent with periods of renunciation of tribute or of lapsed adherence to Islam when the Arabs political authority was weak Thus we learn that the native princes of Sindh submitted to the Caliph Umar bin Abd al Aziz in 718 having heard of his famed piety and justice and the son of Dahir became a Muslim under the Caliph Hisham however Dahir relapsed and punitive expeditions by the Arab governors were necessary Rather more is known about Sindh in the 12th century since it is described by various Muslim travellers and geographers of that period Arab families continued to be politically dominant in the Muslim centres of power Ibn Hauqal whose account of the Islamic world is based on his journeys in the middle decades of the century describes the general prosperity and the cheapness of food in Southern Pakistan There had been cultural assimilation to the Indian ways of Life in that the dress and hair style of Muslims and infidels had become identical They mostly wore a characteristic short tunic though some classes notably the merchants had long flowing robes like the Iraqis and Persians The language of Sindh were indigenous Sindhi tongue with some Arabic and in Makran the local Makrani with some Persian

Politically there seem to have been governors in each principal town virtually independent of each other generally owning a moral and spiritual allegiance to the Abbasids in Baghdad but no longer sending revenue The governor of the largest town al Mansura was in Ibn Hauqals time Qureshi ie of Meccan origin a descendant of Habbar bin Aswad wh had seized power in that town The poistion in Multan was similar at Jundur just outside was the military camp of the governor a descendant of Sama bin Luayy Multans poistion was an exposed one with powerful Hindu kingdoms like that of the Hindu Shahis or Waihand or Udabhanda on its northern flank and warlike Rajput princes to the east Its governors nevertheless preserved it as a bastion of Islam although deriving revenue and strength from its shrine to the sun god Aditya They appropiated all offerings brought by Hindu pilgrims handing on only a part of them to the idols custodians and when Hindu potentates menaced Multan the governor threatened to destroy the idol thus causing them to withdraw The traditional Islamic sciences flourished at this time in theMusims towns of Sindh Zeal for the faith was sharpened by the proximity of hostile infidel powers Ibn Hauqal again notes how assiduously the Quran the traditions and the Islamic Law were cultivated The later compilers of biographical dictonaries such as al Samani and Yaqut note a certain number of scholars with the gentilic of al Sindhi In the course of the 10th century some of the towns of Sindh and particularly Multan came to give their allegiance to Shahi rulers rather than to Baghdad Al Mansura at one point acknowledged the suzerainty of the great Buyid Amir in Persia Adud al Daula More lasting were the links with Fatimid Caliphs of Misr and North Africa the Abbasids great rivals The maritime connection of the Sindh ports with the Arabian Sea and the Red Sea shores had always been maintained and Ismaili propaganda came to Sindh via Yemen Sindh was in fact the scene of one of their most successful missions in the eastern Islamic World Sources from the end of the 10th century state that the ruler of Multan recognized as his suzerain the Fatimid in Misr and sent presents the descendants of Sama bin Luay had obviously changed their allegiance from the Abbasids Ismailism nevertheless continued to be strong there and to retain its links with the Syrian and Egyptian centres of the sect The present day Ismaili or Maulani communities of the extreme north of Pakistan in Chitral Hunza and Gilgit may conceivably have had connections with Sindhi groups and there may also be a continuity with the Ismaili communities of Gujarat and Khandesh in modern India Sindh was thus firmly won for Islam but there are also signs that a knowledge of Islam was at this time percolating from southern Afghanistan into what is now the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial region of Pakistan The rise of the Saffarid brothers Yaqub and Amr bin Laith in the later decades of the 9th century was important for the spread of Islam into eastern Afghanistan the Zunbils or local rulers of Zamin Dawar were humbled and Kabul and Bamiyan centres of the Turk Shahi dynasty were occupied Quantities of Buddhist and other idols and temple treasures were captured some of which were forwarded as presents to Baghdad where their public display caused a sensation Islam was thus certainly brought to the borders of modern Pakistan and there are even signs of Muslim missionary activity at a slightly earlier date In the Peshawar museum is a celebrated inscription both in Arabic and Sanskrit attesting to the presence of Islam in the Tochi valley of Waziristan in the yr 857 it records the erection of building presumably a Mosque and must be one of the earliest Islamic inscriptions in the Indian subcontinent In both Islam Christianity missionary efforts on remote and dangerous frontiers ave often been undertaken by unorthodox and schismatic elements so it is possible that there were at work in the valleys running down to the middle Indus adherents of the early Islamic Khariji sect for Afghanistan was one of their last refugees and as late as 982 the inhabitants of Gardiz in the Paktiya province of modern Afghanistan are described as Kharijis Otherwise the only Muslim in the upper Indus valley until the Ghaznavid invasions must have been small colonies of merchants known to have existed for instance in the Hindu Shahi capital of Waihand near modern Attock

Because of the Arab presence in India during these early centuries some knowledge of the Indian way of life percolated back to the centres of Islam Since Islam is a complete system of belief containing everything necessary for a mans conduct in this world and his salvation in the next there was no reason beyond sheer intellectual curiosity why Moslems should be interested in greater Hindustan But a few Moslem scholars did show some interest for one thing the subcontinent was popualarly famed as a home of esoteric lore and magic From the time of the Abbasid Caliph al Mansur missions came from Sindh to the Baghdad court bringing native Indian scholars and certain Sanskrit texts The Indian knowledge of medicine mathematics astronomy and philosophy was especially esteemed and various transaltions were made into Arabic The Barmakid Vizier Yahya bin Khalid sent an agent to India around the year 800 to collect medicinal herbs and drugs and to acquire knowledge of Indian religions  information used by several later Islamic authors between the 9th and 11th centuries The towering figure in the introduction of Indian Culture to the Islamic world is however a scholar from Khwarazam in Central Asia Abu Raihan al Biruni who died in about 1050 He was able to observe Indian customs and lore and was the 1st Muslim scholar to become a competent Sanskritist The outcome of his studies was his great book on India Tahqiq ma lil Hind a compendium of all the knowledge which he could collect on Indian subjects It was written in a remarkably dispassionate vein Abu Raihan al Birunis purpose was not in any way polemical and although he remained a firm Muslim and condemned such features of Indian life as the sevitude of the caste system the blinkered self satisfaction of the pandits and the degraded Hindu view of women and marriage he felt a certain attraction towards the pure theoretical philosophy of the Hindus just as he did towards that of the ancient Greeks Al biruni had no successor but his work must be regarded as one of the great achievements of inter cultural contact in mediaeval times

The Munich Agreement was an agreement between France Italy Nazi Germany and Britain After Germany invaded the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia the British and French prime ministers tried to get Hitler to agree not to use his military in future in return for the land he had taken Hitler agreed to sign a promise At first people thought the agreement was a success but Hitler invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia in 1939 which led to the start of the Second World War

Czechoslovakia was a strong country with a modern army in 1938 Hitler wanted Lebensraum and wanted to have all Germans in Czechoslovakia united with Germany As most of the German speaking population of Czechoslovakia was in the Sudetenland Hitler set his sights there first He knew that most of the industrial strength of Czechoslovakia would be lost with the Sudetenland leaving Czechoslovakia Britain France and the USSR had all agreed to support Czechoslovakia if it came to war

On September 12th 1938 Hitler told Sudeten Germans that he would support them On 15th Chamberlain met with Hitler in a last ditch attempt to avert war Hitler moderated his demands saying he was only interested in parts of Czechoslovakia and Chamberlain thought it reasonable and that Hitler would be satisfied However on the 22nd Hitler changed his demands saying he wanted the whole of the Sudetenland The British Navy mobilised and war seemed imminent

Mussolini persuaded Hitler to attend a 4 power peace conference in Munich on the 29th September The conference was held between four leaders Hitler for Germany Mussolini for Italy Chamberlain for Britain and Daladier for France The Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia were not invited

Benes the Czech president resigned He felt betrayed after Britain and Frances promises to help Czechs On the 1st October Germans walked into the Sudetenland and Hungary and Poland also helped themselves to land in Czechoslovakia where people of that nationality had been living

Strike may mean

Strike may refer to a fight including

In sports and games

A strike action is when a large number of workers stop working in protest Strikes are usually done by a labor union to get better pay hours or working conditions They became important during the Industrial Revolution when many worked in factories and mines In many countries it is against the law to strike In other countries people who strike are protected under certain conditions

Strikes generally take the form of a picket line The workers walk in front of where they work chanting and holding signs Workers on strike usually do not stop people from crossing the picket line However some people will not cross a picket line to buy something from the company This is a way of showing solidarity for the union Most unions will also not cross a picket line and do business with companies on strike For example members of the Teamsters a truck driving union will not deliver to a business that is on strike 

The first known strike was in the 12th century BC in Egypt Workers under Ramses III stopped working on the Necropolis until they were treated better The word gets its name from modern times in 1768 sailors in London struck or removed the sails of trade ships at port 

In 1917 the Mexican Constitution was the first to make sure that workers had the right to strike

A wildcat strike is a strike that is not approved by the labor union Wildcat strikes are not always protected like union approved strikes are 

A sympathy strike is a strike that is done to support another group of workers on strike 

A slowdown strike is when the workers are still working but very slowly It is usually done when workers are not allowed to have a full strike

A green ban is a strike that is done to get the company to adopt more environmentally friendly practices

Many countries do not allow workers to strike at all but some allow it under certain conditions

In the United States people who work for the Federal Government are not allowed to strike Some states like New York do not allow people who work for the state government to strike Railroad and airline workers are not allowed to strike except under certain conditions

When a strike is called a government may try to stop it by calling in the police or the military The threat of force is sometimes enough to get the workers to stop This happened in the Seattle General Strike of 1919 when over three thousand marines sailors and police officers were called into the city by the mayor of Seattle and the Attorney General of Washington

The owners of a company may also decide to hire new workers This may cost less than giving into the demands of the workers This is another way of breaking the strike These workers called scabs by strikers are often yelled at as they pass through the picket line Many unions say that workers who helped break a strike by crossing the picket line are not allowed to be in the union If the company is a union shop this means that helping break a strike could get a worker fired from that company forever

Flight is a method of moving through the air To do this birds use wings with light hollow bones and feathers on them Birds have a streamlined body shape so that less air actually pushes onto them when flying

The Entente cordiale was a number of agreements signed on 8 April 1904 between the United Kingdom and France The two countries were worried that their two growing empires would cause a war between them The Entente cordiale was the end of almost a millennium of intermittent war The agreement led to the Triple Entente that fought the Triple Alliance in the First World War The Entente cordiale has lasted until modern times 

The Parma Wallaby is the smallest of the macropus genus It can grow up to 52 cm in length with a tail about the same length They weigh up to 5 kg The Parma wallabys fur is a grey brown colour on the back with a dark stripe It has a white stripe on its face and a white belly

In the late 1800s it was thought to be extinct Parma Wallabies had been introduced and established on Kauwau Island New Zealand where they were rediscovered in the 1960s A lot of effort was made to capture and take the wallabies back to Australia A small wild group was found in Gosford New South Wales in the 1970s by Eric Worrell from the Australian Reptile Park Parma wallabies are officially listed as vulnerable because there are not many of them they only live in small areas and they are threatened by land clearing and other animals such as foxes

The Triple Entente was the name given to alliance between the United Kingdom France and the Russian Empire The alliance was made after the Anglo Russian Entente an agreement between Britain and Russia in 1907 The alliance was then made stronger by agreements made with Japan the United States and Spain In this form there was a balance of power which meant that no group was much stronger than any other one with the Triple Alliance of Germany Austria Hungary and Italy

With the First World War the Triple Entente became a military alliance In 1915 Italy left the Triple Alliance and from 1916 fought against Germany The Russian revolution in October 1917 meant that Russia left the alliance but the military alliance between France and the UK lasted until 1940 when Nazi Germany invaded France The main change in this movement was helped by the british cabinet most notably by Joe Farrell Max Dudley Thomas Lloyd and Davey Murphy

The Triple Alliance was a military alliance between Germany Austria Hungary and Italy that lasted from 1882 until the start of World War I in 1914 The three countries promised to help each other if another country attacked them Some Italian people were not happy about the agreement because Austria Hungary was an old enemy In 1914 the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente started World War I In 1915 Italy left the alliance and fought against Austria Hungary and Germany from 1916

Formed during the latter fall of 2001 by Tom and Paul a few songs were written and recorded most of which never saw the light of day One of the first live shows was in support of Belgian metalcore act xReprisalx On an extreme budget the first material was a four track demo recorded by Mick Kenney on the 31st of December 2001 at Necrodeath studios in Birmingham which eventually saw daylight in late January 2002 The four tracks pointed out the future musical direction of Unsanctum and also gained the band positive reviews and the necessary exposure After copious amounts of promotional material Unsanctum signed with CacophonousVisible Noise records in July 2002 On December 7th 2002 at Necrodeath studios in Birmingham with producer Mick Kenney Unsanctum began the recording of 11 tracks for their debut album to be released on CacophonousVisible Noise records in early 2003

Ignite the skies was remixed and remastered three times The initial recording was considered so substandard that both the guitar and bass tracks were rerecorded at Bonafide Studios in London during February 2003 This is not to say that the album was not everything we had hoped for but simply due to the amount of time wasted and damage done in the early stages of production we were so far behind schedule that unfortunately perfection was not an option In April 2003 Unsanctum accepted an endorsement from Bc Rich guitars Ignite the skies was released on the 23rd of June 2003 through Cacophonous records and distributed by Pinnacle worldwide Amongst other feedback it received a KKKK rating in Kerrang and an 810 rating in Metal Hammer In July 2003 Unsanctum accepted an endorsement from Jgermeister In August 2003 Unsanctum set off on their second UK tour with Burning Skies playing 12 consecutive shows around the UK receiving a 45 live review in Kerrang and an 810 live review in Metal Hammer On Halloween 2003 Unsanctum performed a live soundtrack to the silent classic The Cabinet Of Dr Caligari to a sold out audience at the Victoria Albert Museum in London Following a number of high profile shows Unsanctum completed a third UK tour with Walls Of Jericho in November 2003

In early 2004 Unsanctum were voted the third Best Newcomer of 2003 by Terrorizer magazine A new logo was designed by Christophe Szpajdel Unsanctum had taken over 4 years of our lives we were broke burnt out and the time had come for a rest Work began on the second album in early 2004 Words can not express how grateful we are to the people who turned up at our shows gave us a place to crash and helped to realise our dream

The close of 2005 saw an overwhelming response to a limited press three track demo titled Adamantium Rage the first new Unsanctum recording in over 2 years In February 2006 David decided to leave the band he was the first and only member to leave the band since the band confirmed their original line up in 2001 and was replaced by Chris shortly after In March 2007 after 3 years in the making work finally ceased on the follow up to Ignite the skies The bands second full length to be titled Ritual killing marked their return to the UK metal scene Harder faster and a hell of a lot more pissed off the bands song writing ability had matured significantly displaying a harsher thrash orientated sound 

The band started work on a third album Throne to the wolves in 2008 due for release in 2009

Post traumatic stress disorder is a disease linked to anxiety It can develop when people are severely harmed or experience something extremely upsetting

PTSD is different from traumatic stress which is less intense and shorter and combat stress reaction which happens to soldiers in wartime situations and usually goes away PTSD has been recognized in the past by different names like shell shock traumatic war neurosis or post traumatic stress syndrome

Throughout history there have been many accounts of people experiencing symptoms of what is now called PTSD One such account describes Samuel Pepys who witnessed the Great Fire of London in 1666 Six months after the event he wrote in his diary that he was unable to sleep at night because a great fear of fire took him one night he was unable to fall asleep before two in the morning because of that fear

Between 50 and 90 of people in the United States will experience a trauma at least once in their life However not everyone who experiences a trauma will develop PTSD In the US the prevalence of PTSD  the percentage of people who have the condition  is about 8

PTSD is more common among specific groups of people who are more likely to experience a trauma These groups include physicians firefighters soldiers and people working in emergency medical services Among these people the prevalence of PTSD is much higher reaching over 50

For PTSD to be diagnosed officially a person has to meet specific criteria or requirements and show specific symptoms These requirements are listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV TR Written by the American Psychiatric Association the DSM IV TR lists all of the mental health conditions that are recognized by the APA and sets out the official requirements that have to be met for each condition to be diagnosed

According to the DSM IV TR for PTSD to be diagnosed a person has to meet the following requirements Traumatic Exposure The person has experienced a traumatic event The traumatic event caused the person to be physically hurt or violated or it put the person or others around him in danger of being hurt or killed During the traumatic event the person felt very scared horrified or helpless Re experiencing Even after the trauma has ended the person continues to re experience the trauma in some way For example the person might have nightmares or flashbacks The person might also have a strong physical or emotional reaction when something happens which reminds him of the trauma AvoidanceNumbing The person keeps trying to avoid things which remind him of the trauma or things which bring up upsetting feelings about what happened He might also forget parts of what happened to him or he might feel numb emotionally Increased Arousal The persons body shows signs of being on high alert like it is always under attack He might be jumpy or have trouble with sleeping concentrating or feeling angry The persons symptoms have lasted for at least a month The persons symptoms causes him to have trouble at work in his relationships or in some other important area of his life

Some experts have written that Fabricated Posttraumatic Stress Disorder should be considered when a patients symptoms are suspicious or unusual These experts have suggested that it should raise a red flag if a patient claims to be suffering from both PTSD and a Traumatic Brain Injury as a result of the same accident They suggest that TBI  a physical injury to the brain  causes amnesia or memory loss for the event that caused the brain injury Without memory of the traumatic event they reason a patient probably could not experience certain symptoms of PTSD like nightmares or flashbacks about the event because they do not remember what happened They conclude that in typical cases Traumatic Brain Injury trumps the diagnosis of PTSD

Hugo Marie de Vries was a Dutch botanist and one of the first geneticists He suggested the concept of genes rediscovered Gregor Mendels laws of heredity and introduced the term mutation He developed a mistaken mutation theory of evolution mainly due to the peculiarities of his favourite organism the Evening Primrose

Carl Erich Correns was a German botanist and geneticist His research into heredity led to his rediscovery of Gregor Mendels earlier work independently of Hugo de Vries He grew hybrids of peas and of maize and reached the same interpretation as Mendel in 1899 

The occurrence of cases in which the heterozygote is intermediate was added in a footnote to his 1900 paper That dominance was not always present had been seen and understood by Mendel according to his letters to Ngeli By a quirk of history Correns was a student of Ngeli a renowned botanist with whom Mendel corresponded about his work with peas Ngeli failed to understand how significant Mendels work was

In 1913 Correns became the first director of the newly founded Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin Dahlem

Correns produced the first evidence of cytoplasmic inheritance in his 1909 paper on variegated leaf colour in Mirabilis jalapa The basis of this inheritance is that chloroplasts the organelles which conduct photosynthesis are inherited solely from the maternal parent

Erich von Tschermak Seysenegg was an Austrian agronomist Von Tschermak is one of three men  the others were Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns  who independently rediscovered Gregor Mendels work on genetics Von Tschermak published his findings in June 1900

By a quirk of history Correns was a student of Karl Wilhelm von Ngeli a renowned botanist with whom Mendel corresponded about his work with peas but who failed to understand how significant Mendels work was Von Tschermak was a grandson of a man who taught Mendel botany during his student days in Vienna

Survival of the fittest is a famous phrase of Herbert Spencer which describes the idea that there is in nature competition to survive and reproduce It is a metaphor as are the phrases struggle for existence and natural selection both of which were used by Charles Darwin Scientists often use such metaphors as shorthand for key ideas These metaphors stick in the mind but they need to be properly understood or they may be used wrongly

Herbert Spencer was a British social philosopher who applied his personal conception of evolution to many other fields from the origin of the solar system to economics He first used the term in his book Principles of Biology published in 1864 In that book he wrote This survival of the fittest which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms is that which Mr Darwin has called natural selection or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life

Spencer later published a book called The Man versus the State There he used the phrase to explain why societies of a militant type would not adopt his theories The way he uses the term suggests he is talking about a general principle

Thus by survival of the fittest the militant type of society becomes characterized by profound confidence in the governing power joined with a loyalty causing submission to it in all matters whatever 

In the first four editions of On the Origin of Species Darwin used only the phrase natural selection It was his way of making an analogy with artificial selection a practice which was well understood in England at that time

Spencers Principles of Biology was the first to use the phrase survival of the fittest in print Darwin agreed that the phrase survival of the fittest was better than natural selection Natural selection personified nature but was really about survival Survival of the fittest would avoid this problem but it lost the analogy between natures selection and the fanciers The phrase was first used by Darwin in the 5th edition of The Origin published in 1869 in which Chapter 4 describes Natural Selection or the Survival of the Fittest

In the introduction to the 5th edition Darwin gave full credit to Spencer writing I have called this principle by which each slight variation if useful is preserved by the term Natural Selection in order to mark its relation to mans power of selection But the expression often used by Mr Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is more accurate and is sometimes equally convenient

The co discoverer of natural selection Alfred Russel Wallace also used the term survival of the fittest as well as natural selection and struggle for existence He rather preferred the last two terms to natural selection Since both these evolutionists used them the three metaphors were obviously useful in getting over what were at the time unfamiliar ideas

The phrase survival of the fittest is shorthand for the fact that not all members of a species will contribute equally to the next generation It is not a value judgement but a concept of evolution equivalent to natural selection Fitness is now used in a highly technical sense in population genetics which should not be confused with its use in everyday language

Today the phrase survival of the fittest is widely used in popular literature for many topics not just those related to biology It has widely been used both by people who are in favour of Social Darwinism and those who are against it It has also been used to talk about competition of all kinds Popular literature often uses the phrase as a catchphrase All such extensions of a metaphor need to be watched carefully They may preserve the original meaning or they may not

The idea that all life evolved was hotly debated even before Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species Even today some people still talk about the concept of evolution and what it means to them to their philosophy and their religion Sometimes these people also talk about the social implications of evolution This debate is mostly about the meaning of evolution to human life or about human nature not about how evolution works

Some people believe in guided evolution or theistic evolution They say that evolution is real but it is being guided it some way 

There are many different concepts of theistic evolution Many creationists believe that the creation myth found in their religion goes against the idea of evolution As Darwin found out early on the most controversial part of the evolutionary thought is its implications for human origins 

In some countries especially in the United States there is tension between people who accept the idea of evolution and those who reject it The debate is mostly about if the ideas in evolution should be taught in schools and in what way

Other fields like cosmology and earth science also do not match with the original writings of many religious texts These ideas were once also fiercely opposed Death for heresy was threatened to those who wrote against the idea that the Earth was the centre of the universe Giordano Bruno was burnt at the stake by the Holy Inquisition for teaching that the Earth moved around the Sun

Evolutionary biology is opposed much more from religious believers than other groups or organizations

The Roman Catholic Church now has a neutral position with regards to evolution Pope Pius XII stated in his encyclical Humani Generis published in the 1950s

Pope John Paul II updated this position in 1996 He said that Evolution was more than a hypothesis

The Anglican Communion also does not oppose the scientific account of evolution

Many of those who accepted evolution were not much interested in biology They were interested in using the theory to support their own ideas on society

For instance in the Bible there is a passage after Noahs Ark landed Noah got drunk while naked and Ham laughed at him and was cursed by Noah somehow became part of a justification for racism and slavery 

Later people also tried to use evolution to support racism Evolution itself is not about racism However people wanting to justify racism claimed that black people were inferior They said that because evolution shows that in nature better animals tend to survive leading to evolution of improved animals they had the right to oppress the weaker They believed they were clearly better but that would need evidence There is no agreed evidence that any race of humans is better than any other race

The idea of eugenics was rather different Two things had been noticed as far back as the 18th century One was the great success of farmers in breeding cattle and crop plants They did this by selecting which animals or plants would produce the next generation The other observation was that lower class people had more children than upper class people If the higher classes were there on merit then their lack of children was the exact reverse of what should be happening Faster breeding in the lower classes would lead to the society getting worse

The idea to improve the human species by selective breeding is called eugenics The name was proposed by Francis Galton a bright scientist who meant to do good Today Galton is remembered for many things he did in statistics and psychology He was the first to use regression analysis to see how different things that depend on one another influence one another He used fingerprints in forensic science He is seen as the father of experimental psychology together with Wilhelm Wundt He developed the bean machine to show probability distributions among other things 

Galtons ideas were meant to do good He said that the human gene pool should be improved by selective breeding policies This would mean that those who were considered good stock would receive a reward if they reproduced However other people added to this and said those considered bad stock would need to undergo compulsory sterilization prenatal testing and birth control and they might even have to be killed 

The problem with Galtons idea is how to decide which features to select Theres so many different skills people could have you could not agree who was good stock and who was bad stock There was rather more agreement on who should not be breeding Several countries passed laws for the compulsory sterilisation of unwelcome groups Most of these laws were passed during between 1900 and 1940 After World War II disgust at what the Nazis had done squashed any more attempts at eugenics

Another example of using wrong ideas about evolution to support bad things is Social Darwinism Social Darwinism is a term given to the ideas of the 19th century British social philosopher Herbert Spencer Spencer had ideas about survival of the fittest which he applied to commerce and human societies as a whole 

Other people used these ideas to claim that social differences racism and imperialism were justified Today most scientists and philosophers say that the theory of evolution should not be used to support such ideas They also say that it is difficult to find data that can support them

Certain people oppose the idea of evolution They disagree with it for a number of reasons Most often these reasons are influenced by their religious beliefs Their beliefs are usually called creationism or intelligent design 

Despite this evolution is one of the most successful theories in science People have found it to be useful for different kinds of research None of the other proposals explain things such as fossil records as well So for almost all scientists evolution is not in doubt

Palembang is a city of 1286000 people in the south of the Indonesian island of Sumatra It is the capital of the province of South Sumatra 

The city was the capital of the old Buddhist kingdom of Srivijaya that included a large part of Malaysia and Indonesia After a 1025 raid by the Chola Empire of southern India it became less imortant Srivijayas capital moved north to Jambi Palembang is also the home of Parameswara the ruler of Malacca who started the most important empire in Malaysian history 

The Battle of Palembang was fought near the city during the Second World War between February 13 February 15 1942 Japanese forces captured the airport and nearby oil refinery after a short but bloody battle

Palembangs economy has grown after it became a venue for National Sporting Event in 2004 Palembang was also one of hosts of the 2007 AFC Asian Cup

The city is served by Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II Airport which has many flights to many cities in Indonesia and also to Singapore and Malaysia

This city is famous in Indonesia for its Pempek fish cakes

Social Darwinism is a term used for different movements Charles Darwin was one of the main discoverers of evolution Evolution is a concept from biology that tries to explain how different life forms change over time It basically says that because most children are not exactly like their parents there is change Some of the children will have features These features will mean that some children are better adapted to the place where they live They will therefore be better able to have offspring Some of the offspring might also have the trait of their parents

Social Darwinism theories try to use these ideas from biology for human society They talk about a Struggle for survival of human societies During the era of Nazi ideologies the idea of Survival of the fittest combined with racism Since the Aryan race was better than all the other races it needed more space to live This space was to be provided in the east Today this is seen as badly named Most of the ideas for the theories are from Lamarckism and not from the theory of evolution proposed by Charles Darwin

Beccles is a small market town in Suffolk England around the area of The Broads The town had a population of about 9 850 people around 2005 Beccles has a suburb called Worlingham which has a combined population of about 13580 Beccles is twinned with Petit Couronne in France

Beccles was once a flourishing Saxon riverport but today it is in the Waveney valley There is a popular boating centre The town was granted its Charter in 1584 by Queen Elizabeth I

The Peck family was associated with Beccles for a long time The Puritan Peck was eventually forced to leave and went to Hingham Massachusetts founded by many members of his parish where he lived for several years until King Charles I had been executed and Oliver Cromwell was in charge of government At that time Robert Peck decided to return to Hingham Norfolk and continued his pastorship of St Andrews Church He died in Hingham but he left descendants in America as well as his brother Joseph Peck who settled in Rehoboth Massachusetts

Lamarckism is a theory of evolution Evolution tries to explain how species change over time Today the most accepted theory of evolution was developed by Charles Darwin 

Lamarckism was developed by Jean Baptiste de Lamarck He based his ideas to some extent on those of Erasmus Darwin the grandfather of Charles Darwin Lamarckism says that individuals do not only pass on the things they received from their parents but also all those things that they learned during their lifetime As an example he cited giraffes Giraffes which have long necks must have evolved from ancestors with much shorter necks His idea was that adults needed to stretch their neck to reach leaves from high branches Therefore he thought the children inherited longer necks This idea is called the inheritance of acquired characteristics

Although Darwin did not entirely break with these ideas his characteristic idea of natural selection relates to the individualss relative survival and success in reproduction Better adapted forms leave on average more offspring This changes the proportion of alleles in the population 

Gregor Mendel discovered some basic rules of heredity These rules of Mendelian inheritance contradict Lamarcks theories entirely but are consistent with natural selection This explains why Lamarcks ideas are no longer regarded as a sound explanation of evolution Where Lamarck and Darwin do agree is that evolution did take place

The identification of Lamarckism with the inheritance of acquired characteristics alone is regarded by some as an over simplification rehashed in textbooks repeatedly Stephen Jay Gould wrote that late 19th century evolutionists re read Lamarck cast aside the guts of it and elevated one aspect of the mechanics inheritance of acquired characters to a central focus it never had for Lamarck himself He argued that the restriction of Lamarckism to this relatively small and non distinctive corner of Lamarcks thought must be labelled as more than a misnomer and truly a discredit to the memory of a man and his much more comprehensive system Gould advocated defining Lamarckism more broadly in line with Lamarcks overall evolutionary theory

However as scientist historians such as Michael Ghiselin and Stephen Jay Gould have pointed out none of these views were original to Lamarck On the contrary Lamarcks contribution was a systematic theoretical framework for understanding evolution He saw evolution as comprising two processes

In essence a change in the environment brings about a change in needs resulting in a change in behavior bringing change in organ usage and development bringing change in form over time and thus the gradual transmutation of the species 

The modern point of view is that neither of his two forces exists Lamarck can be credited with the first fully worked out account of evolution However his ideas of how it came about are entirely mistaken

Darwinism is a term used to talk about different ideas connected to those Charles Darwin had about evolution The meaning of Darwinism has changed over time and depends on who uses the term 

The term was coined by Thomas Henry Huxley in April 1860 He used it to describe evolutionary concepts including earlier concepts such as Malthusianism and Spencerism In the late 19th century it came to mean the concept that natural selection was the only mechanism of evolution in contrast to Lamarckism Around 1900 Gregor Mendels work was rediscovered Darwinism was the word used to classify the ideas Today both theories have been unified As modern evolutionary theory has developed the term has been associated at times with specific ideas

Prenatal testing or Prenatal diagnosis is a word used for a number of technolgies These technologies are used to test unborn children for birth defects as well as for some genetic disorders They can be classified as invasive tests where a needle is inserted to get placental fluid for example Non invasive tests include things like sonograms

Most often this is performed to test for birth defects Common procedures include amniocentesis sonograms nuchal translucency testing or genetic screening The tests can be used to check for conditions such as Down syndrome spina bifida cleft palate Tay Sachs disease sickle cell anemia thalassemia cystic fibrosis and fragile x syndrome In some cases the tests are administered to determine if the fetus will be aborted

In some cases fetal screening has been done to determine characteristics generally that are not considered birth defects In some parts of the world if a fetus is determined to be female it is sometimes aborted The rise of designer babies and parental selection for specific traits raises a number of ethical and legal issues

Compulsory sterilization is a term used for laws that force certain groups of people to be sterilized so that they can no longer make babies

Malthusianism is a set of ideas developed by Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus Malthus was an economist who lived during the industrial revolution 

In 1798 Mathus published a book called An Essay on the Principle of Population In it he describes the Malthusian growth model He wrote that the growth of the population is exponential The growth of the food supply however is only arithmetical This means if there are no limits to the growth of the population that it will not be possible to produce food for all of them This is known as Malthusian catastrophe Malthus wrote during the time of the Manchester School of thought

The Tory party had paternalistic ideas such as charity for the poor Malthus said this would not work and it would only lead to increased numbers of the poor The theory was developed into Whig economic ideas such as The Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 Its opponents described the act as a Malthusian bill designed to force the poor to emigrate to work for lower wages to live on a coarser sort of food The act brought the construction of workhouses despite riots and arson

By that time the ideas were widespread in progressive social circles One supporter was the novelist Harriet Martineau whose circle of acquaintances included Charles Darwin The ideas of Malthus were a significant influence on the inception of Darwins theory

According to Dr Dan Ritschel of the Center for History Education at the University of Maryland The great Malthusian dread was that indiscriminate charity would lead to exponential growth in the population in poverty increased charges to the public purse to support this growing army of the dependent and eventually the catastrophe of national bankruptcy Though Malthusianism has since come to be identified with the issue of general over population the original Malthusian concern was more specifically with the fear of over population by the dependent poor

One of the earliest critics of Malthusian theory was Karl Marx who referred to it as nothing more than a schoolboyish superficial plagiary of De Foe Sir James Steuart Townsend Franklin Wallace and others postulating that progress in science and technology would allow for indefinite exponential population growth

Many people today still believe that Mathus was right about human population growth getting out of hand

Sir Francis Galton FRS half cousin of Charles Darwin was an English scientist His main field of work was human biology and inheritance of mental characteristics

Galton was a polymath an anthropologist a eugenicist a tropical explorer geographer inventor meteorologist proto geneticist psychometrician and statistician He was knighted in 1909

Galton produced over 340 papers and books in his lifetime He created the statistical concepts of normal distribution correlation and regression toward the mean He was the first to apply statistical methods to the study of human differences and inheritance of intelligence 

He was the first person to do twin studies His method was to trace twins through their life history making many kinds of measurement Unfortunately though he knew about monozygotic and dizygotic twins he did not appreciate the real genetic difference Twin studies of the modern kind did not appear until the 1920s

He also introduced the use of questionnaires and surveys to collect data on human communities He needed such data for genealogical and biographical works and for his anthropometric studies He was a pioneer in eugenics coining the very term itself and the phrase nature versus nurture As an investigator of the human mind he founded psychometrics and differential psychology 

Galton created a method for classifying fingerprints that proved useful in forensic science As the initiator of scientific meteorology he devised the first weather map proposed a theory of anticyclones and was the first to establish a complete record of short term climatic phenomena on a European scale He also invented the Galton Whistle for testing differential hearing ability

Herbert Spencer was an English philosopher prominent liberal political and social theorist of the Victorian era

Spencer developed an all embracing conception of evolution He saw evolution as the progressive development of the physical world biological organisms the human mind and human culture and societies 

Spencer never married he remained a bachelor He contributed to a wide range of subjects including ethics religion politics philosophy biology sociology and psychology

He is best known for coining the phrase survival of the fittest He did this in Principles of Biology after reading Charles Darwins On the Origin of Species This term strongly suggests natural selection yet as Spencer extended evolution into realms of sociology and ethics he made use of Lamarckism rather than natural selection

National sport means

Co evolution is where the existence of one species is tightly bound up with the life of one or more other species Species whose lives connect evolve together What happens is that survival rates in each species changes as a result of changes in the other species

Examples of co evolution are

Co evolution is extremely common and may involve more than two species Mimicry rings with dozens of species are known

New or improved adaptations which occur in one species are often followed by the appearance and spread of related features in the other species

The study of co evolution dates back to Darwins On the Origin of Species There he discussed how cats increased heather by reducing mice The point being that mice raid bumblebee nests and bumblebees pollinate red heather So more cats cause more heatherp74 In the last paragraph of the Origin Darwin remarks

The life and death of living things is intimately connected not just with the physical environment but with the life of other species These relationships are dynamic and may continue for millions of years as has the relationship between flowering plants and insectsThe gut contents wing structures and mouthparts of fossilized beetles and flies suggest that they acted as early pollinators The association between beetles and angiosperms during the Lower Cretaceous period led to parallel radiations of angiosperms and insects into the late Cretaceous The evolution of nectaries in Upper Cretaceous flowers signals the beginning of the mutualism between hymenopterans and angiosperms

Another good example is malaria in which there are three partners the mosquito the parasite Plasmodium and a land vertebrate such as a mammal or bird The actual species of malaria differs according to the vertebrate so there are actually thousands of different relationships which follow the same pattern

Adaptive radiation and speciation rates can be high in parasites Sibling species are very common in the bug Erythroneura in which about 150 transfers from one host to another has resulted in about 500 species in the genus

The clearest evidence comes from the large size of many parasitic families 

A huge number of species are parasitic A survey of the feeding habits of British insects showed that about 35 were parasites on plants and slightly more were parasites on animals That means that nearly 71 of insects in Britain are parasitic Since British insects are better known than those elsewhere this means that by far the majority of insect species throughout the world are parasitic Another estimate went p3

There are several other invertebrate phyla which are wholly or largely parasitic Flatworms and roundworms are found in virtually every wild species of vertebrate Protozoan parasites are also ubiquitous Hence parasitism is almost certainly the most common feeding method on Earth

Rongorongo is a system of writing native to Easter Island It cannot be read There are two dozen examples of rongorongo script mostly carved on tablets made from wood of the portia tree Thespesia populnea known as makoi in Rapanui language The longest inscription in existence is the Santiago Staff a wooden sceptre 126 centimetres long and 65 centimetres wide bearing 2300 glyphs The staff which once belonged to an Easter Island king was acquired by the Chilean Navy in 1870 and is now in Santiagos Museum of Natural History

The Candle Festival is held in Ubon Ratchathani Isan Thailand

At the start of rainy season it is traditional for the devout to donate to monks items of personal use such as candles This part of the festival became the core of the Ubon Ratchathani version of the event It is now a major event both for residents and for tourists giant candles are paraded through the town each representing a local temple district or other institution The more elaborate versions are accompanied by scenes of Hindu and Buddhist mythology sculpted in wood or plaster and coated with wax

The portia tree Family Malvaceae is a small tree or shrub 5 10 m high that is pantropical in littoral environments although probably native only to the Old World In Hawaii and elsewhere in the Pacific it is possibly indigenous although may have been spread by early Polynesians for its useful wood and fiber 

Common names vary according to the country and include Indian tulip tree Pacific rosewood seaside mahoe surina suriya bebaru or baru baru milo or miro makoi gangaraavi poovarasu and plaksa

Traditionally it was planted in sacred groves and used for religious sculpture throughout eastern Polynesia It was used for the rongorongo tablets of Easter Island

The PAL region is a video game region which covers Australia New Zealand the United Kingdom and some other European countries

PAL is a method to encode color in analogue television broadcasting systems It is one of three standards in wide use today The other two are SECAM and NTSC

European countries wanted to introduce colour television in the 1950s They had a few problems though NTSC is used in America American electricity supply uses 60 Hz AC but Europe uses 50 Hz TV studios lightbulbs change brightness at twice the supply frequency If the TV picture rate is not the same as the grid frequency then a dark bar can be seen on the TV The bar moves up or down the TV screen This is due to the stroboscope effect which also makes car wheels appear to turn the wrong way on TV

NTSC has some weaknesses The most important weakness of NTSC was that colour tones would change if transmission conditions were bad For these reasons the development of the SECAM and PAL standards began The goal was to make a colour TV standard with a picture frequency of 50 fields per second and a better colour picture than NTSC

PAL was developed by Walter Bruch at Telefunken in Germany The format was first unveiled in 1963 with the first broadcasts beginning in the United Kingdom and Germany in 1967

Telefunken was later bought by the French electronics manufacturer Thomson Thomson also bought the Compagnie Gnrale de Tlvision where Henri de France developed SECAM SECAM is the first European colour television standard Thomson nowadays also co owns the RCA brand for consumer electronics products which created the NTSC colour TV standard before Thomson became involved

The term PAL is often used informally to refer to a 625 line50 Hz television system and to tell it apart from a 525 line60 Hz NTSC system Accordingly DVDs are labelled as either PAL or NTSC This labelling is informally referring to the line count and frame rate even though technically the European discs do not have PAL composite colour This usage may lead readers to believe that PAL defines image resolution even though it does not The PAL colour system can be used in conjunction with any resolution and frame rate and various such combinations exist NTSC by contrast does define the video line and frame format

In Rhetoric a tautology is when a meaning is repeated this is often done using different words that say the same thing Most often this is used unintentionally but it can of course also be used for emphasis

Basically it is saying the same thing twice but you might say it using different words ie You might say We are reversing backwards This is tautology because you have already said that you are moving backwards but it has been repeated possibly as a mistake or for emphasis

Sometimes the tautology is not easy to see

In propositional logic a tautology is a propositional formula that is true under any possible interpretation In other words a tautology cannot be wrong For example formulae in maths are tautological because they always hold true for any values The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein first applied the term to propositional logic in 1921

A statement in logic is considered correct if it is neither a tautology or false

Examples of a tautology 

Toromi is a Japanese voice actor singer cosplayer and artist who is most known for her role as Mii in the Popotan video games Not much is known about Toromi but she can be found on many websites because of her work in both video games and anime

In the last quarter of 2009 the Ryohoji Temple in Hachioji Tokyo promoted the site using Moe characters drawn by Toromi

The longhorn beetles or long horned beetles are a family of beetles that usually have very long antennae They can be longer than the beetles body

Macroevolution refers to large scale evolution For some this means the origin of species For others it means the large scale changes seen in the fossil record 

It is a term of convenience for most biologists it does not suggest any change in the process of evolution For some palaeontologists some things they see in the fossil record cannot be explained just by the gradualist evolutionary synthesis They are in the minority There are some interesting discussions by other palaeontologists

Some biologists use the term for evolution in already separated gene pools Macroevolutionary studies focus on change that occurs at or above the level of species

Microevolution on the other hand refers to smaller evolutionary changes within species or populations During microevolution changes in allele frequencies definitely do occur Some biologists Richard Dawkins in particular have suggested that the gene is the object of selection This was always challenged by Ernst Mayr The individual is the entity which survives or not which reproduces or not and which reproduces successfully or not Changes in gene frequency in populations is a by product of what happens to individuals

Paleontology evolutionary developmental biology and sequence analysis contribute much evidence for the patterns and processes that can be classified as macroevolution An example of macroevolution is the appearance of feathers during the evolution of birds from one group of dinosaurs

Within the modern evolutionary synthesis school of thought macroevolution is thought of as the compounded effects of microevolution Thus the distinction between micro and macroevolution is not a fundamental one the only difference between them is of time and scale

Some creationists have also adopted the term macroevolution to describe the form of evolution they reject They may accept that evolutionary change is possible within species but deny that one species can evolve into another These arguments are rejected by biologists who hold that there is ample evidence that macroevolution has occurred in the past

Some examples of subjects whose study falls within the realm of macroevolution

Russian entomologist Yuri Filipchenko first coined the terms macroevolution and microevolution in 1927 in his German language work Variabilitt und Variatio

Since then their meanings have been revised several times and fallen into disfavour with many who prefer to speak of biological evolution as one process

Evolution as a whole is strongly supported by many kinds of evidence 

The issue for biologists is whether there is any sense in having the special term macroevolution The answer is yes for a few biologists who proposed one or more evolutionary mechanisms which worked above the species level The ideas of punctuated equilibrium and species selection were suggested but in each case most biologists felt they could be explained by the usual small scale changes This explains why macroevolution is perhaps a term biologists do not need to use

When discussing the topic creationists use strategically elastic definitions of micro and macroevolution Macroevolution by their definition cannot be attained Any observed evolutionary change is described by them as being just microevolution

The debate between biologists continues with some biologists stating that there is significant evidence that other factors have acted during macroevolution and others maintaining that macroevolution can still be fully explained by the mechanisms of microevolution

A gene pool is made of all possible variations of all genes of a population Plants have a gene that says what colour their flower will be Peas have either red or white flowers That way the gene pool of peas includes the options to have red flowers and to have white flowers

Transcription is when RNA is made from DNA The information is copied from one molecule to the other The DNA sequence is copied by a special enzyme called RNA polymerase to make a matching RNA strand 

This strand is a pre messenger RNA strand Next the non coding introns are stripped out by a spliceosome The remaining exons are put together to make a messenger RNA 

The product is called messenger RNA because it carries a genetic message from the DNA to the protein making machinery of the cell Transcription is the first step that leads to the expression of the genes

The stretch of DNA that is transcribed into an RNA molecule is called a transcription unit This contains

As in DNA replication only one of the two DNA strands is transcribed This strand is called the template strand because it provides the template for ordering the sequence of nucleotides in an RNA transcript The other strand is called the coding strand Its sequence is the same as the newly created RNA transcript 

The DNA template strand is read 3 5 direction by RNA polymerase and the new RNA strand is synthesized in the 5 3 direction RNA polymerase binds to the 3 end of a gene on the DNA template strand and travels toward the 5 end

Roger D Kornberg won the 2006 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his studies of the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription

William Hilton Hovell was an English explorer of Australia Together with Hamilton Hume he discovered much of Victoria

William Hovell was born at Yarmouth Norfolk England He joined the Royal Navy and became a captain In October 1813 he moved to New South Wales with his wife Esther Arndell He got work as a ship captain and made several trading trips along the coast and to New Zealand In 1816 he was shipwrecked in Bass Strait In 1819 he lived near Sydney and did some exploring to the south He discovered the Burragorang Valley in 1823

ImageSturt and Hume and Hovell expeditionsjpgthumbwidth in number of pixelspxrightMap showing Hume and Hovells tripIn 1824 Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane asked Hovell to go with Hamilton Hume to explore the south part of New South Wales and Victoria He wanted to know more about any rivers that might run south Hovell was not an explorer but he knew how to navigate There were problems deciding who was going to pay for the expedition The two explorers bought most of the equipment The government provided saddles clothes blankets and guns Hume and Hovell left Sydney on October 3 1824 with six men five bullocks three horses and two carts The Murrumbidgee River was in flood so they had to make one of the carts into a kind of boat to get across The men horses and bullocks swam over A day or two later in rough hilly country they had great difficulty in finding a path for the carts On October 27 they decided to leave them behind They came to a large river on November 16 which Hovell called Humes River he being the first that saw it This was the Murray River renamed by Charles Sturt a few years later It was impossible to cross here but after a few days they found a better place They built the rough frame of a boat and managed to get across By December 3 they had reached the Goulburn River During the next ten days it was hard traveling through rough country but they did get to more level and open land On December 16 they saw Port Phillip Bay They went along its shores in south westerly direction They came to what is now Corio Bay near Geelong Hovell made a mistake of one degree in working out the longitude The explorers thought that they were on Western Port Bay The party went back on December 18 and went more to the west This was an easier journey By January 8 1825 they came to the end of their food For a few days they lived on fish and a kangaroo they were able to shoot On January 16 they reached the carts they had left behind them and 2 days later came to Lake George

On March 25 Governor Brisbane wrote about the discoveries of Hovell and Hume in a letter to England He said that he was going to send a ship to Western Port to have it explored His successor Governor Ralph Darling towards the end of 1826 sent an expedition led by Captain Wright to Western Port Hovell went with this expedition and his mistake in longitude was soon discovered Hovell explored the land around Western Port and to the north Near the coast at Cape Paterson he discovered great quantities of very fine coal This was the first discovery of coal in Victoria Hovell was away 5 months on this expedition He tried during the next 10 years to obtain some special reward from the government He had already got 1200 acres for the trip with Hume and 1280 acres for the trip to Western Port He did not think this was enough 

He spent the rest of his life at his farm at Goulburn New South Wales He married Sophia Wilkinson in 1848 In December 1853 Hovell was special guest at a public dinner in Geelong Victoria His speech was reported in some of the newspapers Hume thought that Hovell tried to claim all the credit for their joint expedition This led to a long and bitter public fight between the two men A full report of the speech shows that Hume was wrong Hume was an experienced leader in the bush Hovell was well educated with a friendly character During their expedition they worked well together They were responsible for an important piece of exploration Hovells discovery of coal during his visit to Western Port was also important Hovell died in Sydney on November 9 1875 and was buried at Goulburn In 1877 his widow left 6000 to the University of Sydney as a memorial of him which was used to start the William Hilton Hovell lectureship on geology and physical geography

In 1922 a group was started in Melbourne to celebrate the centenary of the expedition Along the path of the expedition 37 memorials were built in Victoria A dam was built on the King River near Cheshunt Victoria in 1973 This formed Lake William Hovell It supplies water for crops vineyards and farms along the King River from Cheshunt to Wangaratta A River Redgum tree Eucalyptus camaldulensis at Albury still has the mark Hovell made in 1824 He carved the words Hovell NovR1724 into the tree The tree has been cloned so its genes can be kept for the future An iron treasure chest made in Germany in about 1660 and owned by Hovell is now in the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney The Hume and Hovell Walking Track has been made following the explorers path from Yass to Albury

The Abbasid Empire was the second of the two great Muslim caliphates of the Arab Empire It overthrew the Umayyad caliphs from all but Al Andalus It was built by the descendant of Muhammads youngest uncle Abbas ibn Abd al Muttalib It was created in Harran in 750 of the Christian era and shifted its capital in AD 762 from Harran to Baghdad It flourished for two centuries Abbasid rule was ended in 1258 when Hulagu Khan the Mongol conqueror sacked Baghdad But they continued to claim authority in religious matters from their base in Egypt

During the period of the Abassid dynasty Abassid claims to the caliphate did not go unchallenged The Shia Ubayd Allah al Mahdi Billah of the Fatimid dynasty which claimed descendency of Muhammad through his daughter claimed the title of Caliph in 909 and created a separate line of caliphs in North Africa Initially it covered only Morocco Algeria Tunisia and Libya but then the Fatimid caliphs extended their rule for the next 150 years taking Egypt and Palestine and even ancient Pakistan before the Abbassid dynasty was able to turn the tide limiting Fatimid rule to Egypt The Fatimid dynasty finally ended in 1171 The Umayyad dynasty which had survived and come to rule over the Muslim provinces of Spain reclaimed the title of Caliph in 929 lasting until it was overthrown in 1031

The first baseball franchise in Seattle was the Seattle Pilots formed in 1969 The Pilots moved to Milwaukee the next year and became the Milwaukee Brewers As a result the city of Seattle King County and the state of Washington sued the American League for 32 million dollars in damages In exchange for dropping the law suit the American League gave Seattle a Major League Baseball team in 1977

The Mariners first winning season was in 1991 and the first time they made the playoffs was in 1995 The Mariners are owned by Nintendo of America and the general manager of the team is Jack Zduriencik

Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio was an Italian artist He worked in Rome Naples Malta and Sicily between 1593 and 1610 He was a painter who did a type of art called Baroque style He was the first person to be really good at painting this way

Even while he was alive many people talked about Caravaggio Some people liked to see what he did and how he lived and thought he was a good person Other people thought he was very strange Some people thought he was bad He did not want to fit in sometimes He started being a famous painter in Rome in 1600 Many people gave him money to paint pictures for them but he used all his money and sometimes got into trouble In 1604 someone wrote a note about him and said that he was a rude and acted like a bad person This note tells us how he lived in 1601cquoteafter a fortnights work he will swagger about for a month or two with a sword at his side and a servant following him from one ball court to the next ever ready to engage in a fight or an argument so that it is most awkward to get along with him40px40pxFloris Claes van Dijk1601 In 1606 he killed a young man in a fight and ran away from Rome He ran away because Rome said it would give money to people who caught Caravaggio In Malta in 1608 he got into a fight again He got into another fight in Naples in 1609 but this fight could have been enemies trying to kill him In 1610 after making paintings for more than ten years he died

Huge new churches and palazzi were being built in Rome the last years of the 1500s and the first years of the 1600s These big churches needed paintings to hang on the walls The Counter Reformation Catholic Church wanted to find painters who would paint beautiful art about God They wanted people to like the art so much that they would think Protestantism was ugly and boring and wouldnt want to start being part of a Protestant church So the Catholic Church needed a new type of art because Mannerism had been the most famous type of art for 100 years and now it was boring Caravaggios paintings were new and different from Mannerism He painted in a way called naturalism which means that he painted things how they actually looked He painted pictures of people so that the people looked real and he made his pictures look exciting by painting a lot of very dark shadows and very bright lights 

While he was alive he was very famous and many artists wanted to paint like he did But after he died most people forgot about him and didnt care about his paintings Hundreds of years later in the 1900s people looked at his art again and saw that he had been very important They saw that many other famous artists had tried to paint like he did Because so many artists had seen his paintings and liked how he painted and tried to paint like he did he made many artists paint in the Baroque style too The Baroque style was very famous for hundreds of years 

Andre Berne Joffroy Paul Valrys secretary said that What begins in the work of Caravaggio is quite simply modern painting

Gothic Revival architecture is architecture that has been made to look as if it is from Medieval times but is really much newer The Gothic style of archicture was built in Europe between 1140 and about 1550 Beginning in the late 18th cenntury through the 19th century and into the early 20th century there was a fashion to build in the Gothic style This is called Gothic Revival The types of buildings that are generally built in the Gothic Revival style are churches cathedrals universities town halls and sometimes houses 

Gothic Revival buildings have features that are like real Gothic buildings They often have

Aikido is performed by blending with the way the attacker moves using the force of the attack rather than coming against it This takes very little physical strength as the aikidka uses the force of the attackers own momentum using stepping and turning movements The techniques are completed with many different throws or joint locks which can be combined with different defenses Aikido is one of many grappling arts

Aikido is based on the martial art of Dait ry Aiki jjutsu but began to separate from it in the late 1920s partly due to Ueshibas involvement with the moto ky religion Ueshibas early students records use the name aiki jjutsu Many of Ueshibas senior students have different approaches to aikido depending on when they studied with him Today aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles with different groups placing importance on different things However they all share techniques learned from Ueshiba and most have concern for the safety of the attacker

Blog is another word for weblog A weblog is a website that is like a diary or journal Most people can create a blog and then write on that blog Bloggers often write about their opinions and thoughts

When a person writes on a blog what they write is in the form of a post which is a single piece of writing on the blog Posts often include links to other websites

Blogs can have one or more writers If they have more than one writer they are often called community blogs team blogs or group blogs

On many blogs the person reading the posts can leave comments which are notes in which a person says what they think about the blog post This makes blogs good for discussion if someone writes something that someone else does not believe to be true someone else can fix it by writing a comment on that blog or on their own blog Someone else cannot change what the post says but the writer of the post can Not all blog posts need to be talked about or fixed But if there are a lot of people interested in a topic they can start a discussion on the original blog on their own blogs or both These people can discuss a topic or their point of view

Very often a community blog or group blog will shrink into a small group of bloggers who know and trust each other called a creative network That kind of community blog will also have a larger group of people a social network who only read the blog Some blogs have scoring of posts that makes these networks more solid so that postings that people like the most are shown first or in a way that is easier to find 

Often people have their own blog and make an RSS feed to it When blogs have RSS feeds other programs called content aggregators can put postings from all the blogs that a person likes in one place Many people find it easier to read all the new posts from blogs they like in one place through RSS instead of going to each site one at a time

Some experts think that community blogs and some groups of individual blogs that talk about similar topics have a power structure like that inside a political party These experts think that a clique will control discussions by choosing when someone has won an argument and when a matter is decided But an advantage of blogs is that even people outside that clique can comment on the original discussion

Happy Gilmore is a sports comedy movie made in 1996 It was directed by Dennis Dugan and stars Adam Sandler

Apollo 13 was the seventh mission of NASAs Project Apollo and the third manned lunar lander mission The flight was commanded by Jim Lovell The other astronauts on board were Jack Swigert and Fred Haise 

The craft was successfully launched toward the Moon but two days after launch a faulty oxygen tank exploded and the Service Module became damaged causing a loss of oxygen and electrical power There was a very big chance that the astronauts would die before they could return to Earth They were very short of oxygen Oxygen is not just used to breathe on the Apollo spacecraft it was used in a device called a Fuel cell to generate electricity So they conserved their remaining air by turning off almost all their electrical equipment including heaters so it became very cold in the spacecraft

In order to make it back to Earth the astronauts also had to move into the Lunar Lander that then became a sort of lifeboat

They were not sure that when it was time for their return to Earth that their parachutes needed to slow the Command Module down would work The parachutes were thrown out by small explosive charges that were fired by batteries The cold could have made the batteries go flat in which case they would not have been able to use their parachutes and the Command Module would have hit the ocean so fast that all aboard would have been killed 

Apollo had taken to the Earths orbit on the 11th April 1970 at 1913 UTC They flew from Cape Canaveral and they wanted to land at Fra Mauro Despite the hardships the crew made it back to Earth In spite of the fact that crew did not land on the Moon the flight became very well known

Some people regarded it as a failure because they did not land on the Moon However others thought it was possibly the National Aeronautics and Space Administrations greatest accomplishment in returning three men in a very damaged spacecraft back to Earth safely 

Books were written about the event including one by Jim Lovell the commander of the mission A movie was also made about it directed by Ron Howard and starring Tom Hanks

Evey Hammond is going out to see a co worker named Gordon Deitrich It is past curfew and she will get in trouble if she gets caught As she walks she is stopped by three police officers She is about to be harmed when V a man who wears a Guy Fawkes mask comes in and rescues her He then invites her to a concert They go up on the roof V waves around and the 1812 Overture begins playing Evey is then shocked to see the Old Bailey be destroyed as V laughs

The next day V enters the British Television Network He then forces the people there to play a message The message goes out to all households In the tape V tells them that they are all to blame for the current state of government The government can tape anyone and arrest anyone and people fear it He then tells them that he was the one that blew up the Old Bailey and to join him next November 5 if they want to stand up to the government

The government meanwhile has started to pour troops into the BTN V fights them off but is caught Evey who has been hiding taps the man on the shoulder and sprays him with pepper spray freeing V Evey is knocked out and wakes up inside Vs location V carried her away because he knew she would be in big trouble for helping him

After some time Evey comes to help V V wants to kill a priest She dresses up like a schoolgirl and goes into the priests office However she backs out and tells the priest that V wants to kill him The priest thinks its a joke until V bursts in and does so Evey runs away to Gordons house Gordon has his own talk show and one day he decides to make a big joke He makes fun of the Chancellor Adam Sutler In response Sutler goes into Gordons house and arrests him

Evey tries to escape and is caught She is then tortured over many days Men plunge her face into water throw her in a cell and shave the hair off her head but she will not tell them any information about V Eventually one of the men tells her that she will be shot behind the barracks if she does not say anything Evey says she would rather be shot she does not have any more fear It is then revealed that V was behind the torture and that he wanted her to have no fear Evey is angry but soon accepts it She later leaves but promises to come back before November 5

Meanwhile a Norsefire Party worker named Eric Finch begins to look into the government He does not trust it anymore He realizes that V is killing everyone who was at a detention camp called Larkhill During the movie V kills the priest who was at the camp a general named Lewis Prothero who is now a talk show host and Delia Surridge who was a doctor He attempts to find out more information about Larkhill In the movie we learn that V was a prisoner at Larkhill and blew the place up when he escaped

Eventually V comes to Finch He is disguised and calls himself Rookwood He tells them everything that Finch has long thought that the Norsefire found a plague and decided to infect the people to put them in power

As November 5 approaches the city gets restless Riots break out V gives out thousands of Guy Fawkes masks to people for them to wear on November 5 A member of the secret police called the Fingermen shoots a young girl wearing one of these masks dead

Evey comes back V then shows her what is going to do He has loaded explosives into a train that will go underneath the Palace of Westminster He then gives her the choice whether to pull the trigger or not He then disappears

V goes to another area where he finds Peter Creedy the second in command of Norsefire Earlier V made a deal with him V would turn himself in if Sutler was killed Creedy shows Sutler and then shoots him in the forehead He then tells V to surrender but V says no In the final battle V kills Creedy and all of his men but is severely wounded himself He dies in Eveys arms

Evey puts him on the train with the explosives Finch who guessed that V would use a train to blow up the Palace draws a gun and attempts to stop her Evey says no When Finch asks why Evey says Because this country needs more than a building It needs hope Finch lowers his gun and allows the train to go Because Creedy and Sutler are dead the army outside the Palace does not know what to do The man in charge orders them to stand down or to put down their weapons and not do anything The 1812 Overture begins again and everyone watches as the Palace of Westminster is destroyed

In a flashback it is shown that Speed Racers older brother Rex died while racing the Casa Cristo 5000 a big race that goes across two continents It is very dangerous and the drivers are very bad The drivers try to get other racers out of the race by hitting their cars or using tools to get them out of the race Rex was said to be cheating in the race This gave people a bad opinion of the racing world

A man named Mr Royalton saw Speeds victory and went to his house He offered Speed a contract to race for the Royalton racing team Speed chose not sign the contract because he loves the art of racing Royalton got angry and told Speed that racing is only a business and that his and his familys belief in it being an art is nonsense He said that he will make sure that Speed does not finish is next race At the next race at Fuji Speed did spin out and he did not finish the race

A very shadowy group then went to the Racer family Earlier in the movie a racer named Taejo Togokhan was beat up His hand was almost cut off for trying to wiktoppose the Royalton family He and someone named Racer X were trying to beat the Royaltons The Royaltons wanted to buy out the Togokhan company However if Togokhan wins the Casa Cristo the value of the company will go up and Royalton could not buy it Togokhan would only race if Speed Racer was on the team Pops said that Speed could not do so Because of this Speed and his girlfriend Trixie said they were skiing but went to the race instead

At the end of the first day of the Casa Cristo the Togokhan team was in second place Togokhan was very mad but Racer X told him that there was much more racing ahead The Racer family found out that Speed was in the race and came to try and get him When Speed refused to leave they stayed to help the team During the night ninjas went into each of the teams rooms to tried to hurt them Togokhan was given a drug that makes it hard for him to stand up The drug stopped him from racing Racer X and Speed fought the ninjas and won Trixie chose to race for Togokhan

On the second day of the race the Togokhan team took the lead However during a pass in the mountain area the Royalton people tried to kidnap and kill the racers Spritle Racer Speeds younger brother hit one of the men with mud and the rest of the Togokhan team and the Racer family fought off the bad guys During this the Sneak Oiler team took the lead in the race Inside the mountain area the Sneak Oilers dropped oil on the road This caused Speed to fall off the mountain He drove up the side of the mountain and took the lead to win the Casa Cristo

It turned out that this was for nothing Togokhans plan all along was to win the race to make the price of the stock of his fathers company increase They made more money when his father sold the company to the Royaltons Speed was very mad He drove around the track Racer X found him and hit his car to make him stop Speed then told Racer X that he thought that Racer X was actually Rex his dead brother Racer took off his mask and showed Speed that he was someone different He then told Speed that they should not let racing change who they are

Allele frequency refers to the different forms of a gene at a single position on a chromosome It is the proportion of a given allele to all alleles at the same locus It is usually expressed as a percentage

Allele frequencies may be used to describe genetic diversity in a population If the frequency of any allele is above 1 it is probable that natural selection is maintaining it at this level This is because the natural mutation rate of an allele is almost always much lower than 1

An allele is a form of a gene at a particular position on a chromosome15 It is the bit of DNA at that placep6

Typical plants and animals have two sets of chromosomes one set inherited from each parent123 These organisms are called diploid Since such organisms have two sets of chromosomes they have two alleles at each gene locusp6

If the two alleles are identical the individual is called a homozygote and is said to be homozygous If instead the two alleles are different the individual is a heterozygote and is heterozygous205 

In a heterozygote the effect of one allele may completely mask the other That is the phenotype produced by the two alleles in heterozygous combination is identical to that produced by one of the two homozygous genotypes212 

The allele that masks the other is said to be dominant to the latter and the alternative allele is said to be recessive to the former This idea originates in the work of Gregor Mendel the founder of genetics

In other cases both alleles contribute to the phenotype

The inheritance of alleles and their dominance can be represented in a Punnett square

An example is the gene for blossom colour in many species of flower A single gene controls the colour of the petals but there may be several different versions of the gene

In this example parents have the genotype Bb If B is found in their genotype the flower will be red Therefore the only time a flower is not red is when the genotype is bb

The probability of the flowers having different genotypes are BB is 25 Bb is 50 and bb is 25 The phenotype of the flower will always be red if a dominant B is in the genotype Therefore there is a 25 chance of getting a flower which is not red and 75 chance of getting a flower which is red

This is when the dominant allele is not completely dominant over the recessive allele This means both the alleles have a degree of phenotypic expression in the hybrids In this case the functional product formed is a little different or is intermediate between the product produced by to the dominant allele and the recessive allele

For example Mirabilis jalapha The heterozygote of this plant produces flowers in the F1 generation of the colour pink in contrast to the red and white homozygotes

There are three ways alleles at a locus may differp6 They are

Two alleles different by descent may or may not be of different state For example one may carry a mutation so making its DNA sequence different

Hugo Wolf was an Austrian composer of Slovene origin He is famous for his Lieder He found new ways of expressing poetry in music  He used the song forms that had been made by Schubert and Schumann but his harmonies bring something very new and personal to German song He was particularly fond of the music of Richard Wagner and his tonal writing is influenced by him He belongs to the late Romantic period

Although he wrote other kinds of music besides Lieder the only other piece of his which is played regularly is his Italian Serenade

At times Wolf worked very hard and composed a lot of music At other times he felt unhappy and had depression Towards the end of his life he went mad and had to go to an asylum He died of syphilis

His name is pronounced Hoo go Volf

The town where Wolf was born is now called Slovenj Gradec in Slovenia but at that time it was part of the Austrian Empire  He was a child prodigy When he was four he learned the piano and violin from his father When he went to school he learned with Sebastian Weixler Music was the only thing he was interested in at school He changed schools but still did little work except for music He went to Vienna to study at the Vienna Conservatory His father did not want him to become a musician He was made to leave the Conservatory because he did not obey their rules Wolf said later that he left because he did not like the old fashioned teaching

After eight months with his family he returned to Vienna to teach music He had a fiery temper which did not make him an ideal teacher However he found some rich people who thought he was a good composer and paid him money so that he could have the time to compose

One of his rich patrons had a daughter called Vally Wolf fell in love with her and he was very depressed when she left him after three years He did not get on well with his family either His father thought he was not trying to make a living Wolf got a job as second Kapellmeister at Salzburg However he was not a good conductor and he soon left that job and went back to Vienna to teach

Wolf was fascinated by the music of Wagner He tried to get Wagners attention once running after his coach and begging Wagner to listen to his music He was terribly sad when Wagner died He wrote a song Zur Ruh zur Ruh which is one of his best early works He was very depressed because Wagner had gone and he felt that there was no one who could inspire him to compose 

The great composer Franz Liszt became interested in him and told him he ought to try to compose some longer pieces He wrote a symphonic poem Penthesilea Wolf also became a music critic He wrote about new pieces of music He liked the music of Liszt but hated the music of several other composers such as Anton Rubinstein and Johannes Brahms  He made many enemies because of the harsh things he wrote about them People called him Wild Wolf He composed several works but could not get them performed He had been very critical of the famous Ros Quartet so they refused to play his music when they were asked

He stopped writing musical criticism in 1887 and began composing once more He wrote songs which set poems by Goethe Joseph von Eichendorff  He wrote an orchestral work called Italian Serenade which is one of his best works outside Lieder Then his father died and he did not compose for the rest of the year

Wolf composed a lot during the years 1888 and 1889 He stayed with some friends outside Vienna and wrote songs using poetry by Mrike He stayed with other friends and composed music to poems by Eichendorff Then he wrote 51 Goethe songs followed by Spanisches Liederbuch  Wolf soon became very famous His songs had very good reviews although not everyone was enthusiastic Brahms wrote bad things about him because of course Wolf had written bad things about Brahms

By 1891 Wolf had become exhausted His health became poor and he suffered from syphilis as well as from depression He composed nothing for several years although his fame continued to spread Even Brahms changed his mind a wrote good reviews of his music

Composers were always expected to write large pieces such as symphonies and operas if they were to be taken seriously Wagner was given the words for an opera called Der Corregidor At first he did not want to use it because the libretto was not good but then he decided to write the opera However although it was performed it never became a success

Wolf last appeared at a concert in February 1897 Soon afterwards he went mad and had to be put in an asylum A lady called Melanie whom he had loved visited him faithfully during his last years until his death on February 22 1903 However she felt very bad because she had not been faithful to her husband and she killed herself in 1906

Wolf is buried in the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna together with many other great composers

Wolfs true greatness lies in his Lieder Although he tried at times to write larger musical works his real genius lay in writing the smaller forms He had a great feel for poetry and it is expressed beautifully in many ways in the late Romantic harmony which is often very chromatic in the very original way he writes the piano accompaniments and in the clever way in which he organizes his songs into groups with connecting themes His most famous collections are Mrike Lieder Eichendorff Lieder Goethe Lieder Spanisches Liederbuch Italienisches Liederbuch and Michelangelo Lieder

Wolf wrote hundreds of Lieder three operas incidental music choral music as well as some rarely heard orchestral chamber and piano music His most famous instrumental piece is the Italian Serenade originally for string quartet and later arranged for orchestra

Todd Bentley is a Canadian Evangelical Christian and evangelist He is one of the main preachers who are part of the Charismatic revival meetings in Lakeland Florida known as the Florida Healing Outpouring Attendance at the meetings is now at as high as 10000 visitors a night from around the world Todd Bentley is increasingly considered a false prophet by Christian communities

When Bently was a child he lived in Gibsons British Columbia a small place in west Canada At the time when Todd Bentleys mother and father stopped being married Bentley wrote in a book about himself that he made in 2008 called The Journey into the Miraculous that he had problems and did illegal drugs He also said in this book that he had drank too much alcohol Bentley said that he changed to believe in Jesus and be a Christan and when he did that he did not have problems with drugs or drinking alcohol anymore He became a Christan when he was 18 years old 

Bentleys beliefs are close to the Assemblies of God and often speaks at meetings in AOG churches although he is not under their authority 

Bentleys other beliefs and style are seen as being from Spiritual Leader to False Prophet by other Christian leaders He yells Bam during sermons He has an unusual appearance for a preacher such as tattoos and piercings 

At greater issue is Bentleys mysticism and spirituality which is nontraditional for the Pentecostal and Charismatic congregations he serves and counter to others Two major points of contention are the manner and veracity of the Faith Healing he conducts in his services and an encounter he discusses with an angel that was a harbinger of financial wellbeing Other major theological debates have arisen from Bentleys references to several trips he has made to Heaven and meetings with the Paul the Apostle These controversies were highlighted by the media coverage of the Lakeland revival

Bentley heavily features faith healing a common feature of the Charismatic movement His behavior in conducting the healings has come under fire for the violence with which it is sometimes done Bentley most commonly places his hands on an individuals head or area of infirmity but sometimes has more violently kicked out or hit the volunteer while calling out for the power of God to descend In response some people may stand and physically tremble while others may literally fall down to the ground in what they call falling under the power of the Holy Spirit The medical corroboration of both the injuries sustained by healings and the healings themselves has been a common topic of dissension in the media

A controversy surrounds his alleged encounter with an angel he called Emma at an AOG church in 2001 Bentley stated that the female angel gave him a vision of gold dust and afterwards he received a breakthrough in terms of financial stability Among Assembly of God congregants especially there was debate about whether such a professed encounter was in line with AOG doctrine as set out in the 16 Fundamental Truths The most persistent challenge was twofold whether the experience of a specifically female angel who prophesied financial well being was a Biblically recognized phenomenon and whether preaching about such an encounter was theologically responsible  would it bring converts to worship such an angel rather than the God who sent her Bentley has argued that it was Gods choice and not his own that an angel appeared to him in that manner

Hurricane Erika was a Atlantic hurricane that hit extreme northeastern Mexico near the Texas Tamaulipas border It happened on August 16 during the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season Erika was the eighth tropical cyclone fifth tropical storm and third hurricane of the season that year The storm was created from a non tropical area of low pressure that was tracked for five days before developing in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on August 14 Under the influence of a high pressure system Erika moved quickly westward and became stronger under favorable conditions

A weak surface area of low pressure came apart from a frontal system on August 8 It was moving southwestward during that time On August 9 it created convection when it was passing underneath a cold core upper level low As the system rapidly continued westward a lot of the convection stayed near the center of the upper level low preventing development of a closed surface circulation On August 13 while located near the northwestern Bahamas an increase in convection made the upper level low building downwards to the middle levels of the troposphere which caused the development of an upper level anticyclone

On August 14 a closed low level circulation nearly developed to the east of Key Largo Florida but because of the deep convection remaining to the north over the mid level center it was weakened The mid level storm continued going westward and it moved across Florida After crossing Florida Hurricane Hunters showed a poor circulation but with winds higher than tropical storm strength and the system was designated as Tropical Storm Erika late on August 14 while located 85 miles west of Fort Myers

With well established outflow and low levels of wind shear Erika became stronger as the circulation became better defined A high pressure system covered over the south central United States forcing the storm to move just south of due west at 25 mph On August 15 convection were made into bands and as its winds were turning into hurricane strength an eye developed within the storm The storm quickly weakened over the Sierra Madre Oriental and Erika was calming down early on August 17 After entering the Gulf of California on August 18 It led to the formation of a tropical disturbance It went to the northwest and weakened on August 20

The region that is today known as Pakistan once had a large Buddhist population with the majority of people in Gandhara being Buddhist Gandhara was largely Mahayana Buddhist and was also a stronghold of Vajrayana Buddhism The Swat Valley known in antiquity as Uddiyana was a kingdom tributary to Gandhara There are many archaeological sites from the Buddhist era in Swat

The Buddhist sage Padmasambhava is said to have been born in a village near the present day town of Chakdara in Lower Dir District which was then a part of Uddiyana Padmasambhava is known as Guru Rinpoche in Tibetan and it is he who introduced Vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet

Buddhism was also practiced in the Punjab and Sindh regions

Gandhara remained a largely Buddhist land until around 800 AD when the Pashtun people invaded the region from Southern Afghanistan and introduced the Islamic religion 

Most Buddhists in Punjab reverted to Hinduism from 600 AD onwards Buddhism was the faith practiced by the majority of the population of Sindh up to the Arab conquest by the Umayad Caliphate in 710 AD

Wenedyk is a made up language Jan van Steenbergen a linguist and translator from the Netherlands made it in 2002 The idea behind it is this what would have happened if the Polish language had developed from Latin instead of Old Slavic Wenedyk is a possible answer to that question It is a Romance language so almost all words are family of words in French Italian Romanian and so on But they look very different and much more like Polish The rules for spelling and pronunciation are completely based on Polish Other parts of the language like grammar and sentence structure are a mixture of Polish and Romance

Together with other made up languages like Brithenig Wenedyk is part of the group of so called alternative languages languages that could have existed if history had been different With Brithenig it is the best known example of this sort of languages Wenedyk became known in Poland after it was written about on the Internet and in the monthly paper Wiedza i ycie

Wenedyk is used in Ill Bethisad a made up world in which the Roman Empire was stronger than in real history It is the most important language of the Republic of the Two Crowns a country similar to the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth but not broken up by partitions like Poland was

Wenedyk uses the same letters as Polish does

Also there are seven sounds written by two letters

Wenedyk is pronounced just like Polish Stress almost always falls on the second last syllable A preposition and a pronoun are treated as one word so when the pronoun has only one syllable the preposition is stressed

Wenedyk does not have articles words like a and the This is an important difference with the other Romance languages and also with made up languages like Esperanto and Ido The reason is that Polish and most other Slavic languages do not have those words and even in Vulgar Latin they were not so strong yet

Words in Wenedyk can have many forms English words have only a few but in Wenedyk a lot of forms exist where English would have used other words like prepositions or modal verbs In the case of nouns pronouns and adjectives these forms are called cases Wenedyk has three cases

Wenedyk also has a vocative Often it has the same form as the direct case but not always O potrze Oh father

There are three genders and four declensions They are very much like the declensions in Latin

Here is a chart of the pronouns in Wenedyk

Verbs have a lot of forms too Every pronoun has its own form

Most tenses have special forms

The word list of Wenedyk made public on the internet has more than 4000 words This chart of 30 words shows what Wenedyk looks like when compared to other Romance languages

The Lords Prayer

Brithenig is constructed language that was made up by Andrew Smith from New Zealand in 1996 The idea behind it is the question what the Welsh language would have looked like if it had been a Romance instead of a Celtic language a sister language to French Spanish and Italian but one that looks much like Welsh It plays a key role in the made up world of Ill Bethisad where Latin took the place of Old Celtic as the spoken language of the people in Great Britain thus giving way to the development of Brithenig

Brithenig is the best known example of the so called group of alternative languages languages that could have existed if history had been different Another well known example is Wenedyk which does the same with Polish as Brithenig does with Welsh

The following list of 30 words shows what Brithenig looks like compared to a few other Romance languages

The bean machine also known as the quincunx or Galton box is a machine invented by Sir Francis Galton to demonstrate the law of error and the normal distribution

The machine consists of a vertical board with interleaved rows of pins Balls are dropped from the top and bounce left and right as they hit the pins Eventually they are collected into one ball wide bins at the bottom The height of ball columns in the bins approximates a bell curve

Overlaying Pascals triangle onto the pins shows the number of different paths that can be taken to get to each pin 

A large scale working model of this device can be seen at the Museum of Science Boston

Regression analysis is a field of statistics It is a tool to show in what way a number of independent variables influence a dependent variable There are different ways how this can be done Better fitting curves are usually more work to calculate 

Data modeling can be used without any knowledge of underlying processes that have generated the data in this case the model is an empirical model Moreover in modelling knowledge of the probability distribution of the errors is not required Regression analysis requires assumptions to be made regarding probability distribution of the errors Statistical tests are made on the basis of these assumptions In regression analysis the term model embraces both the function used to model the data and the assumptions concerning probability distributions

Regression can be used for prediction inference hypothesis testing and modeling of causal relationships These uses of regression rely heavily on the underlying assumptions being satisfied Regression analysis has been criticized as being misused for these purposes in many cases where the appropriate assumptions cannot be verified to hold One factor contributing to the misuse of regression is that it can take considerably more skill to critique a model than to fit a model

Forensic science is when different fields of science work together to answer the questions a lawyer would ask Most often forensics is about proving that someone was present at a place where a crime was committed Specialists take samples which are later analyzed in a laboratory Most forensic tests can take from 1 hour to one year and investigators need to double check the answer so they know that the answer is the right answer If a forensics team made a mistake the wrong person could be jailed or they could get into trouble themselves

Samples commonly taken include fingerprints People also look for other things that could be used for example a few hairs Samples like hair or skin can be use for DNA testing which allows to tell the gender of the person the hair is from amongst others 

When someone is accused of committing the crime these pieces of evidence can then be matched up Then if they are correct the person is charged

A fingerprint is a trace of a human finger left on a surface Human fingers have small structures on them These structures are unique in every human they can be used as means of identification

Physical cosmology is a branch of astronomy It looks at large structures in the universe It wants to explain how the universe came to be what it is today

Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher FRS was an English statistician evolutionary biologist and geneticist He was described as a genius who almost single handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science Richard Dawkins described him as the greatest of Darwins successors

In 1919 Fisher started work at Rothamsted Experimental Station at Harpenden Hertfordshire England Here he started a major study of the extensive collections of data recorded over many years This resulted in a series of reports under the general title Studies in crop variation 

This began a period of great productivity Over the next seven years he pioneered the principles of the design of experiments and elaborated his studies of the analysis of variance He studied the statistics of small samples Perhaps even more important he began his systematic approach of the analysis of real data as the springboard for the development of new statistical methods 

He began to pay particular attention to the labour involved in the necessary computations and developed practical methods In 1925 his first book was published Statistical methods for research workers This went into many editions and translations in later years and became a standard reference work for scientists in many disciplines In 1935 this was followed by The design of experiments which also became a standard

His work on the theory of population genetics made him one of the three great figures of that field together with Sewall Wright and JBS Haldane He was one of the founders of the neo Darwinian modern evolutionary synthesis In addition to founding modern quantitative genetics with his 1918 paper he was the first to use diffusion equations to attempt to calculate the distribution of gene frequencies among populations 

He pioneered the estimation of genetic linkage and gene frequencies by maximum likelihood methods His 1950 paper on gene frequency clines is notable as the first application of a computer to biology

Fisher had a long and successful collaboration with EB Ford in the field of ecological genetics The outcome of this work was the recognition that the force of natural selection was often much stronger than had been appreciated Many ecogenetic situations were not selectively neutral on the contrary they were maintained by the force of selection 

Fisher was the original author of the idea of heterozygote advantage which was later found to play a frequent role in genetic polymorphism The discovery of indisputable cases of natural selection in nature was one of the main strands in the modern evolutionary synthesis

Fisher was an ardent promoter of eugenics and he held the Chair in Eugenics at University College London from 1933 until he moved to Cambridge University as Professor of Genetics in 1943 

His book The genetical theory of natural selection was started in 1928 and published in 1930 with a second edition in 1950 He developed ideas on sexual selection mimicry and the evolution of dominance He showed that the probability of a mutation increasing the fitness of an organism decreases proportionately with the magnitude of the mutation He also proved that larger populations carry more variation and have a larger chance of survival He set forth the foundations of what was to become known as population genetics

About a third of the book concerned the applications of these ideas to humans and presented the data available at that time He presented a theory that attributed the decline and fall of civilizations to the fertility of the upper classes being low 

Using the census data of 1911 for Britain he showed that there was an inverse relationship between fertility and social class This was partly due he believed to the rise in social status of families who were not capable of producing many children but who rose because of the financial advantage of having a small number of children 

Therefore he proposed the abolishment of the economic advantage of small families by instituting subsidies to families with larger numbers of children with the allowances proportional to the earnings of the father He himself had two sons and six daughters According to Yates and Mather His large family reared in conditions of great financial stringency was a personal expression of his genetic and evolutionary convictions

The book was reviewed among others by physicist Charles Galton Darwin a grandson of Charles Darwins and following publication of his review CG Darwin sent Fisher his copy of the book with notes in the margin The marginal notes became the food for a correspondence running at least three years Fishers book also had a major influence on WD Hamilton and the development of his theories on the genetic basis for kin selection

Between 1929 and 1934 the Eugenics Society also campaigned hard for a law permitting sterilisation on eugenic grounds They believed that it should be entirely voluntary and a right not a punishment They published a draft of a proposed bill and it was submitted to Parliament Although it was defeated by a 21 ratio this was viewed as progress and the campaign continued Fisher played a major role in this movement and served in several official committees to promote it

In 1934 Fisher moved to increase the power of scientists within the Eugenics Society but was ultimately thwarted by members with an environmentalist point of view and he along with many other scientists resigned

Sewall Green Wright was an American geneticist He was a founder of population genetics and contributed to evolutionary theory His work on path analysis was also notable 

With RA Fisher and JBS Haldane he was a founder of theoretical population genetics He is the discoverer of the inbreeding coefficient and of methods of computing it in pedigrees He extended this work to populations calculating the degree of inbreeding of members of populations as a result of random genetic drift Together with Fisher he pioneered methods for calculating the distribution of gene frequencies among populations as a result of the interaction of natural selection mutation migration and genetic drift The work of Fisher Wright and Haldane on theoretical population genetics was a major step in the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis of genetics with evolution Wright also made contributions to mammalian genetics and biochemical genetics

Wrights explanation for stasis was that organisms come to occupy adaptive peaks In order to evolve to another higher peak the species would first have to pass through a valley of maladaptive intermediate stages This could happen by genetic drift if the population is small enough If a species was divided into small populations some could find higher peaks If there was some gene flow between the populations these adaptations could spread to the rest of the species This was Wrights shifting balance theory of evolution There has been much skepticism among evolutionary biologists as to whether these rather delicate conditions hold often in natural populations Wright had a long standing and sometimes bitter debate about this with RA Fisher who felt that most populations in nature were too large for the effects of genetic drift to be important Research by Dobzhansky and EB Ford showed that natural selection in the field was a much stronger force that Wright had expected Wrights own biographer now doubts the validity of Wrights idea

An anecdote about Wright disclaimed by Wright himself describes a lecture during which Wright tucked an unruly guinea pig under his armpit where he usually held a chalkboard eraser at the end of the lecture Wright absent mindedly erased the blackboard with the guinea pig

The province of West Pakistan was created in 14th October 1955 by the merger of the provinces states and tribal areas of the western wing The province was composed of twelve divisions and the provincial capital was established at Lahore The province of East Bengal was renamed East Pakistan with the provincial capital at Dacca The federal government moved in 1959 from Karachi to Rawalpindi whilst the federal legislature moved to DACCA

West Pakistan formed a seemingly homogeneous block but with marked linguistic and ethnic distinctions and the One Unit Policy was regarded as a rational administrative reform which would reduce expenditure and eliminate provincial prejudices However with the military coup of 1958 trouble loomed for the province when the office of Chief Minister was abolished and the President took over executive powers for West Pakistan The province of West Pakistan was dissolved in July 1970 by President Yahya Khan

General elections held in December 1970 saw the Awami League under Mujibur Rahman win an overall majority of seats in parliament The Awami League advocated greater autonomy for East Pakistan but the military government did not permit Mujibur Rahman to form a government

Ferozepur founded by Firuz Shah Tughluq is a district in the Indian state of Punjab The district is the oldest British district of Punjab It was created in 1833 as district headquarters and was part of the earstwhile Lahore Division 

Ferozepur has easy access by road and rail to other places such as Lahore Okara Kasur Multan The area is a center of many holy shrines and historic places At the city of Zira a Jain Swetambar Temple with very old brass icons and beautiful wall murals is located

In addition to cotton and grain cultivation and agriculture related services Firozpur has some light manufacturing Commercial progress is limited because it is very near the border between India and Pakistan

The Kori Creek is a tidal creek between the Kutch region of the Indian state of Gujarat and the Kachchhi region of the Pakistani province of Sindh It is in the Rann of Kutch marshland east of the Sir Creek which is disputed between India and Pakistan It is a 96 km strip of water disputed between the Republic of India and Pakistan claimed by India as a part of the Indian Rann of Kutch marshlands The creek which opens up into the Arabian Sea divides the Kutch region of the Indian state of Gujarat with the Sindh province of Pakistan The long standing dispute hinges in the actual demarcation from the mouth of Kori Creek to the top of Kori Creek and from the top of Kori Creek eastward to a point on the line designated on the Western Terminus From this point onwards the boundary is unambiguously fixed as defined by the Tribunal Award of 1968

The creek itself is in the uninhabited marshlands During the monsoon season between June and September the creek floods its banks and envelops the low lying salty mudflats around it During the winter season the area is home to flamingoes and other migratory birds

 The dispute is in the interpretation of the boundary line between Kutch and Sindh as depicted in a 1914 and 1925 map At that time the region was a part of Bombay Presidency of undivided India After Indias independence in 1947 Sindh became a part of Pakistan while Kutch became a part of India

Pakistan lays claim to the entire creek as per paras 9 and 10 of the Bombay Government Resolution of 1914 signed between then the Government of Sindh and Rao Maharaj of Kutch The resolution which demarcated the boundaries between the two territories included the creek as part of Sindh thus setting the boundary as the eastern flank of the creek The boundary line known as the Green Line is disputed by India which maintains that it is an indicative line known as a ribbon line in technical jargon Indias position is that the boundary is mid channel as depicted in another map drawn in 1925 and implemented by the installation of mid channel pillars back in 1924

India supports its stance by citing the Thalweg Doctrine in International Law The law states that river boundaries between two states may be if the two states agree divided by the mid channel Though Pakistan does not dispute the 1925 map it maintains that the Doctrine is not applicable in this case as it only applies to bodies of water that are navigable which the Kori Creek is not India rejects the Pakistani stance by maintaining the fact that the creek is navigable in high tide and that fishing trawlers use it to go out to sea Several cartographic surveys conducted have upheld the Indian claim Another point of concern for Pakistan is that Kori Creek has changed its course considerably over the years If the boundary line is demarcated according to the Thalweg principle Pakistan stands to lose a considerable portion of the territory that was historically part of the province of Sindh Acceding to Indias stance would also result in the shifting of the landsea terminus point several kilometres to the detriment of Pakistan leading in turn to a loss of several thousand square kilometres of its Exclusive Economic Zone under the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea

In April 1965 a dispute there contributed to the Indo Pakistani War of 1965 when fighting broke out between India and Pakistan Later the same year British Prime Minister Harold Wilson persuaded both countries to set up a tribunal to resolve the dispute A verdict was reached in 1968 which saw Pakistan getting 10 of its claim of 9000 km

The disputed region was at the center of international attention in 1999 after Mig 21 fighter planes of the Indian Air Force shot down a Pakistani Navy Breguet Atlantique surveillance aircraft over the Kori Creek on August 10 1999 killing all 16 on board India claimed that the plane had strayed into its airspace which was disputed by the Pakistani navy

Though the Kori creek has little military value it holds immense economic gain Much of the region is rich in oil and gas below the sea bed and control over the creek would have a huge bearing on the energy potential of each nation Also once the boundaries are defined it would help in the determination of the maritime boundaries which are drawn as an extension of onshore reference points Maritime boundaries also help in determining the limits of Exclusive Economic Zones and continental shelves EEZs extend to 200 nautical miles and can be subjected to commercial exploitation

The demarcation would also prevent the inadvertent crossing over of fishermen of both nations into each others territories

Since 1969 there have been eight rounds of talks between the two nations without a breakthrough Steps to resolve the dispute include

Since neither side has conceded ground India has proposed that the maritime boundary could be demarcated first as per the provisions of Technical Aspects of Law of Sea However Pakistan has staunchly refused the proposal on the grounds that the dispute should be resolved first Pakistan has also proposed that the two sides go in for international arbitration which India has flatly refused India maintains that all bilateral disputes should be resolved without the intervention of third parties

He was also a well known taxonomist tropical explorer ornithologist historian of science and naturalist 

His work contributed to the reform of the theory of evolution that is known as modern evolutionary synthesis today He also contributed ideas on the definition of the term species 

Mayr joined the faculty of Harvard University in 1953 where he also served as director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology from 1961 to 1970 He retired in 1975 as emeritus professor of zoology showered with honors 

After his retirement he went on to publish more than 200 articles in a variety of journalsmore than some reputable scientists publish in their entire careers 14 of his 25 books were published after he was 65 Even as a centenarian he continued to write books

Mayr was awarded the Linnean Societys prestigious Darwin Wallace Medal in 1958 He was never awarded a Nobel Prize but he noted that there is no Prize for evolutionary biology and that Darwin would not have received one either Mayr did win a 1999 Crafoord Prize That prize honors basic research in fields that do not qualify for Nobel awards and is administered by the same organization as the Nobel Prize

Neither Darwin nor anyone else in his time knew the answer to the species problem how multiple species could evolve from a single common ancestor 

Ernst Mayr approached the problem with a definition for the concept species He wrote that a species is not just a group of individuals that look similar but a group that can breed only among themselves

Formed in 1903 as a result of the amalgamation of three clubs from Aberdeen they rarely challenged for honours until the 1950s when they won each of the major Scottish trophies under manager Dave Halliday This level of success was surpassed in the 1980s when under the management of Alex Ferguson they won three league titles four Scottish Cups and a Scottish League Cup alongside the European honours Aberdeen were the last club outside of the Old Firm to win a league title in 198485

Aberdeen have played at Pittodrie Stadium since their inception The ground currently has a capacity of 22199 and was the first all seated and all covered stadium in the United Kingdom Pittodrie was also the first football stadium to feature a dugout an invention of player and coach Donald Colman The clubs colours have been primarily red and white since 1939 before this they played in black and gold vertical stripes

Aberdeen attract support from the city and surrounding areas as they are the only senior team within a wide area Aberdeen have no geographically close rivals their nearest neighbours at the same level are in the city of Dundee with Dundee United having been their principal rivals in the New Firm in the 1980s Rangers supplanted Dundee United as rivals in the late 1980s but the rivalry while fierce does not approach that of the Old Firm

For the 190405 season Aberdeen adopted a black and gold striped shirt which led to the team being nicknamed Wasps This strip with only minor variations was worn until just before the start of the Second World War The blue shorts lasted until 1911 and then were replaced with white ones Socks were black with gold trim either as stripes or as a solid bar at the turndown

In March 1939 Aberdeen changed the black and gold colours to red and white reflecting the silver and red colours of the official City of Aberdeen arms The first red strips were worn with white shorts these were worn with either red or white socks from 1939 until the 196566 season In 1966 Aberdeen adopted red shorts making the official kit all red similar to that of Liverpool who made a similar change at around the same time This arrangement has continued to the present day with several variations in design in common with most senior clubs as the replica shirt market has expanded In the late 1970s an Admiral strip featured five vertical white stripes on the left side of the shirt and shorts and the early 1980s shirtsas worn at the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup finalfeatured white vertical pinstripes Later design changes included significant amounts of blue and a one season reversion to white shorts although the all red scheme returned in 1997

Shirt sponsorship began in 1987 and the initial shirt sponsor was JVC Since then with the club making fewer appearances on the international stage shirt sponsors have tended to be more localthey have included one of the local commercial radio stations Northsound Aberdeen last season had announced their intention to move away from local sponsorship Sponsored by Apex Tubulars at the time that deal ended at the end of the 200708 season In a turnaround though Aberdeen FC Managing Director Duncan Fraser announced the side would bare the name of local company Team Recruitment on their shirts for the next two seasons It is believed no international sponsor showed interest 

Change or away strips have tended to be either white often with black shorts or a combination of yellow and black referring back to the black and gold strips of the pre war era although for a time in the 1970s Aberdeen sported an all blue change strip with white socks For the 200708 season the change strip is all white with a third kit of yellow and black halves available if needed for European games or in the event of a clash involving both red and white

The club did not have an official crest before 1972 but several variations on the letters AFC had from time to time featured on the shirt usually in some kind of cursive font In November 1972 the club unveiled an official crest or logo designed by Aberdonian graphic designer Donald Addison The design represented a capital letter A as the side view of a football goal with a ball forming the crossbar of the letter This ball was crosshatched in such a way as to depict it as being inside the net signifying the scoring of a goal The logo was completed by the letters FC in smaller type at a level with the ball element This badge was used on the shirts from around 1978 with no significant alterations until the mid 1980s when the words Aberdeen Football Club were added in a circular border and the date of the clubs founding 1903 was added under the goal element The current version of the crest which retains these elements in a unified design was introduced at the start of the 199798 season Two stars signifying the winning of the two European cups in 1983 were introduced over the badge in the 200506 season

Aberdeen have played at Pittodrie Stadium the name of which comes from the Pictish for place of manure throughout their existence The ground was first used by the original Aberdeen FC in 1899 in a 71 win over Dumbarton when they merged with two other teams in 1903 the new club took over the old Aberdeen ground On August 15 1903 8000 spectators turned up to watch the new Aberdeen draw 1 1 against Stenhousemuir the first game played at Pittodrie by its amalgamated tenants The club initially rented the ground but subsequently bought it in 1920 The stadium contains 21600 seats but due to the directors boxes some sources place this figure at 22000 The record attendance occurred on March 13 1954 when 45061 spectators turned up for a Scottish Cup match between Aberdeen and Hearts

The stadium consists of four stands The Main Stand which houses the club offices and players facilities holds the majority of the supporters The Merkland Road Stand is primarily for families The South Stand is opposite the main stand and a quarter of this section is used to accommodate travelling supporters except for Old Firm games where half of this stand is given to the visiting fans The newest element is the Richard Donald stand at the East or Beach End of the ground and is named after former chairman Dick Donald This is a modern twotier design completed in 1993 containing hospitality suites which is significantly taller than the other structures at the ground In 1978 Pittodrie became the first all covered all seater stadium in Britain

Gunnar Nordstrm was a Finnish physicist He is best known for his theory of gravitation which was a competitor of Albert Einsteins general relativity In 1914 Nordstrm added a space dimension to his theory This described gravity and electromagnetism at the same time Unluckily Theodor Kaluza and Oskar Klein have got most attetion on this subject Nordstrm is not well known in his own home country but what he has done is known well in other countries Some Finnish authors call Nordstrm as Finnish Einstein

Nordstrm was born in Helsinki the capital of Finland during the time when Finland was part of Russian Empire He studied at University of Helsinki and completed his dissertation in 1908 Before this he studied for some time in Gttingen where he met the worlds best scientists After this he became a professor at the university In 1910 he started his trip in Europe He visited at Zrich Berlin Vienna and Leyden During his time in the Netherlands he married Cornelia van Leeuwen They had three children 

Nordstrm was very close friend to Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr He died at Helsinki in 1923 because of radioactivity In that time radioactivity was thought to have healing effects

The Modern evolutionary synthesis is about evolution It explains how the discoveries of Gregor Mendel fit with Charles Darwins theory of evolution by means of natural selection Mendel found out how we inherit our genes

Key biologists who contributed work to the synthesis included Julian Huxley Theodosius Dobzhansky Ernst Mayr Ronald Fisher JBS Haldane Sewall Wright GG Simpson EB Ford Bernhard Rensch and G Ledyard Stebbins

The modern synthesis brought Darwins idea up to date It bridged the gap between different types of biologists geneticists naturalists and palaeontologists 

It states that 

We find the strength of natural selection in the wild was greater than even Darwin expected

The idea that new species occur after populations split has been much debated Geographical isolation often leads to speciation In plants polyploidy must be included in any view of speciation 

This shows how some biologists see the synthesis 

Almost all aspects of the synthesis have been challenged at times with varying degrees of success There is no doubt however that the synthesis was a great landmark in evolutionary biology It cleared up many confusions and was directly responsible for stimulating a great deal of research after WWII

There are a number of discoveries in earth sciences and biology which have arisen since the synthesis Listed here are some of those topics which are relevant to the evolutionary synthesis and which seem soundly based

The Earth is the stage on which the evolutionary play is performed Darwin studied evolution in the context of Charles Lyells geology but we now know more about Earth history

Conclusion Our present knowledge of earth history strongly suggests that large scale geophysical events influenced macroevolution and megaevolution These terms refer to evolution above the species level including such events as mass extinction adaptive radiation and the major transitions in evolution

In the past thirty or so years there have been excavations in parts of the world which had scarcely been investigated before Also there is fresh appreciation of fossils discovered in the 19th century but then denied or deprecated Many outstanding discoveries have been made and some of these have implications for evolutionary theory 

A recent examination of two fossil species from the Eocene shows the assembly of the flatfish bodyplan occurred in a gradual stepwise fashion The intermediate stages were fully viable these forms ranged over two geological stages and are found in sites which also yield flatfish with the full cranial asymmetry The evolution of flatfish falls squarely within the evolutionary synthesis

The Rakes Progress is an opera by Igor Stravinsky The libretto written by W H Auden and Chester Kallman is based loosely on the eight paintings and engravings from the 18th century by William Hogarth called A Rakes Progress Stravinsky had seen these paintings in 1947 at an exhibition in Chicago

The Rakes Progress tells the story of a man called Tom Rakewell The word rake in this sense means someone who behaves in an immoral way a man who has relationships with lots of women 

The word progress in the title is ironic because Tom does not really make progress he does not become a better man In a sense he progresses backwards because he starts off in a state of blissful innocence ie he does not understand anything about his life he does not know about good and bad  At the end of the opera he also does not understand anything about his life but that is because he has gone mad 

Tom is like Faust because he sells his soul to the devil In this opera the character Nick Shadow represents the devil Tom leaves his lover Anne Trulove and goes to find lots of other women in London He has several adventures which are all arranged by Nick who is helping him to have a good time In the end Tom finds himself in Bedlam which was a horrible building where mad people were sent in the 18th century

The Rakes Progress is the only full length opera that Stravinsky wrote It is unusual because it was not written in the modern way of most music of the 1950s Because the story of the opera is set in the 18th century the style of the music is deliberately like music from that period It is divided into arias and recitative

Stravinskys music in this opera is in the neoclassical style He uses counterpoint a lot in this opera This helped him later on to write serial music music in which all 12 notes in an octave are equally important  Tom sings some words in the second act of The Rakes Progress which suggest that Stravinsky is going to widen his compositional style in this way Vary the song O London changeDisband your notes and let them range

Tom Rakewell wants to marry Anne Trulove Her father does not trust Tom because he has no regular job Tom would like to have lots of money He meets Nick Shadow who tells him that an unknown uncle has died and left him lots of money He says to Tom that he can be his servant and go with him to London to sort out his inheritance 

Nick takes Tom to places where there is a lot of bad immoral behaviour Tom agrees to spend the night with Mother Goose in her brothel Meanwhile Anne who lives in the country wonders why she has not heard from Tom She thinks something might have happened to him so she goes to London to look for him

Tom is bored with his immoral way of life He tells Nick he wants happiness so Nick says he should marry Baba the Turk a famous bearded lady Soon afterwards Anne finds Toms London house She arrives just in time to see Tom get out of a sedan chair with Baba whom he has just married Tom tells Anne to leave but he really is sorry for what has happened 

In the next scene Tom hates his marriage to Baba who is a strange woman She is a chatterbox with a fiery temper He makes her quiet by throwing his wig over her face then he falls asleep Nick enters with a fantastic Baroque Machine which seems to turn stones into bread Tom cries out in his sleep that he wishes it were true and waking finds the machine he has dreamt of Nick says to Tom that he could make a lot of money if he started a business making these machines Nick is deceiving him the machine does not work

Tom has lost a lot of money and the things in his house are being auctioned by the auctioneer Sellem The objects for sale include Baba who has not moved since being silenced by the wig When she is unwrapped she comes to life again and starts shouting angrily She is angry about the auction that is taking place but calms down when Anne enters Baba tells her to find Tom and set him right and warns her against Nick Shaddow She says she wants to carry on with her acting career 

In a graveyard Nick shows who he really is and tells Tom that he must pay with his soul Nick says he has worked for him for a year and a day but as midnight strikes Nick offers him a way of escape in the form of a game of cards which Tom wins but only because he was thinking of Anne Nick has lost and sinks into the ground telling Tom that he is going mad Tom is put in the madhouse called Bedlam  He believes he is Adonis and that Anne is Venus the Roman goddess of love Anne visits him sings him to sleep then quietly leaves him When he realizes she has gone he dies 

In an epilogue the main characters point out the simple moral that the Devil finds work for idle hands

An illegal prime is a special prime number Such prime numbers are called illegal because there is a way to change them so that they yield something illegal a program to circumvent the Digital Millennium Copyright Act One of the first people to find such a prime was Phil Camody In 2001 he found a prime that contains the gzip compressed source code for a program that can circumvent the Content Scrambling System The Content Scrambling System is used as a way to prevent DVDs from being copied Later other primes were found that resulted in directly runnable programs

The United States and other countries made it illegal to publish or circulate computer programs that can circumvent copy protection Since prime numbers are a concept from mathematics their knowledge cannot be made illegal easily

In October 1999 Jon Lech Johansen and two other people broke the system Originally CSS uses 40 bit cryptographic keys because of different design problems the effective key length is only about 16 bits A 450 MHz processor current at the time could brute force crack this in less than a minute A modern processor such as the Core i7 can crack it in a few seconds

CSS requires special information in the lead in of the disc Since the lead in cannot be changed on recordable DVDs these cannot have CSS protection

Kilmarnock is a large burgh in East Ayrshire Scotland with a population of 44170 It is located roughly between Glasgow and Ayr and is the second largest town in Ayrshire The River Irvine runs through its eastern section and the Kilmarnock Water passes through it giving rise to the name Bank Street

The name comes from the Gaelic cill and the name of Saint Marnoch or Mernoc who is also remembered in the name of Portmarnock in Ireland and Inchmarnock It may come from the three Gaelic elements mo my Ernn and the diminutive ag giving Church of My Little Ernn It is believed by some that the saint founded a church there in the 7th century There are 12 Church of Scotland congregations in the town plus other denominations In 2005 the Reverend David W Lacy minister of the towns Henderson Church was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland

The core of the early town appears to have lain around what is now the Laigh Kirk although the oldest parts of the current building are no earlier than the 17th century extending north and northwest A comparatively modest settlement until the industrial revolution Kilmarnock extended considerably from around 1800 onwards This resulted in formal planned developments such as King Street Portland Street Saint Marnock Street and latterly John Finnie Street the latter often suggested as one of the finest Victorian planned streets in Scotland

Areas of Kilmarnock include

Kilmarnocks traditional industries were based around textiles and heavy engineering eg locomotives from 1837 through 1970 and valves which are still in productionFactdateMay 2008 and carpets from the early 1900s

The carpets manufactured in Kilmarnock were internationally known for their quality and intricacy since the late 1800sFactdateMay 2008 Many locations around the world chose to install BMK carpets Famously RMS Titanic was carpeted using carpets manufactured by Stoddard Carpets the parent company and successor to BMKFactdateJuly 2008 Primarily due to a move by the UK market towards laminated and hard wood flooring but also partially due to a long decline in the industry in the area as well as cheaper but noticeably less hard wearing foreign competition carpet making finally ceased in Kilmarnock in early 2005

Archibald Finnie and his family lived at Springhill House near the Grange Academy They owned many coal mines pits and other companies in Springside and other places John Finnie Street is named after one of the family Shoes were also a major product for some time with Saxone having a factory in the town on the site of where the Galleon leisure centre now stands

Kilmarnock had one of the earliest tram railways in the world running to Troon over the Laigh Milton viaduct The Glasgow and South Western Railway also set up their works here producing nearly 400 locomotives by the time it was absorbed by the London Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923 Some work continued but heavy repairs were sent to St Rollox Locomotive repairs finished in 1952 and the works closed in 1959 Nevertheless locomotives are still made by Hunslett Barclay as well as the maintenance of existing diesel and electric multiple units 

From 1946 tractors were also built in Kilmarnock with a large Massey Harris factory present on the outskirts of the town It later became Massey Ferguson before closing in 1980 Glenfield and Kennedy still survives albeit with a fraction of its former workforce which at its height numbered in the thousands Kilmarnock however is still home to the world famous Johnnie Walkers brand Scotch whisky On the outskirts of the town is Scotlands first privately run prison HM Prison Kilmarnock

The textile and manufacturing sectors across Scotland suffered significant decline in the postwar period and in particular from the 1960s in the face of greater foreign competition Kilmarnock was no exception with the closure or significant reduction of many of its traditional large employers Glenfield and Kennedy Massey Ferguson BMK and Saxone Although significant attempts have been made to halt this decline and attract new employers Kilmarnock saw a continuing net loss of jobs in the five years to 2005

Although traditionally a main shopping area for most of the surrounding districts patterns have changed over the last 20 years traditional centres such as Ayr have been joined by new developments at Braehead and East Kilbride

This difficult economic climate is most visible in the town centre the eastern part of which has been extensively redeveloped with important historic buildings such as King Street Church and the Town Hall being demolished and Duke Street built over

More recently Portland Street which formed the northerly part of the main shopping area lay abandoned for many years due to a decline in retail trade and in the face of possible comprehensive redevelopment The street has now been redeveloped but has not yet regained its former degree of popularity with a Gala Bingo and a JD Wetherspoons taking up much of one side of the street and the rest largely occupied by chain stores

In 2004 the Rough Guide to Scotland described the town as shabby and depressed saddled with some terrible shopping centres and a grim one way systemFactdateMay 2008 The town however contains several parks such as Howard Park Dean Park and Kay Park and residential areas including London Road Dundonald Road McLelland Drive and Howard Park Drive The town also boasts a collection of gift shops cafes bars and restaurants within the very desirable Bank Street area whilst offering retail options within its retail parks at Queens Drive and Glencairn Square

In the past there have been major efforts to improve the quality of life for residents in the towns worst housing estates especially in parts of Shortlees Longpark and Onthank Though the physical rehabilitation of housing in these areas has partly tackled the underlying problems of social exclusion Onthank is arguably that most successful area of regeneration in questionFactdateMay 2008

Much new quality housing has been constructed on the northern fringes of the town in order to service the demand for commuter housing With a journey time of 20 minutes from Kilmarnock to Glasgow the M77 motorway has transformed the link between Glasgow and Kilmarnock The upgrading of the A77 route to Glasgow to the M77 motorway in 2005 has made Kilmarnock more accessible for commuters and recent house price increases have reflected this

In 1812 the famous Kilmarnock and Troon Railway opened mainly to carry coal from the area to the harbour at Troon but also carrying passengers

In 1904 Kilmarnock had its own tramway system built The name of the company was Kilmarnock Corporation Tramways An electric power station was built in the south bank of the River Irvine at Riccarton Overhead power lines and tram lines were laid With continued upgrading and expansion the tram network at its peak went from Ayr Road in Riccarton at its southerly point to Knockinlaw Road in Beansburn in the North At Kilmarnock Cross the line had an easterly spur that stretched along London Road through Crookedholm and finally terminating at Hurlford There had been proposed extensions along Portland Road up John Finnie Street West Langlands Street and eventually towards Crosshouse but by this time increasing costs and the far more flexible motor bus had made inroads and the trams ceased operation in 1926 during the General Strike The council decided not to restart the service and the infrastructure was soon dismantled Today the town is served by Kilmarnock railway station

Production of the DC 10 ended in December 1988 with 386 delivered to airlines and 60 to the US Air Force as air to air refueling tankers designated the KC 10 Extender The DC 10 was succeeded by the related McDonnell Douglas MD 11 which entered service in 1990

Wells Cathedral is an Anglican church in Wells Somerset England It is the seat of the Bishop of Bath and Wells Its building started in 1170 and the Cathedral was dedicated in 1239 

Wells Cathedral has been described as the most poetic of the English Cathedrals Much of the structure is in Early English architecture Many mouldings look almost like sculptures The carved capitals are done in a foliate style known as stiff leaf This adds to their vitality The eastern end has kept much original glass which is rare in England The exterior has a splendid Early English faade and a large central tower

The first church was established on the site in 705 Construction of the present building began in the 10th century under Anglo Saxon rule but was later transformed under the Normans It was largely complete at the time of its dedication in 1239 It was expanded and renovated several times since then and has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building

Peter Price is the current Bishop of Bath and Wells and John Clarke is the Dean

The first church was established here in 705 AD It was dedicated to Saint Andrew The only remains of this first church are some excavated foundations which can be seen in the cloisters The baptismal font in the south transept is the oldest surviving part of the cathedral which is dated to c700 AD

Two centuries later the seat of the diocese was shifted to Wells from Sherborne The first Bishop of Wells was Athelm who crowned King Athelstan Athelm and his nephew Saint Dunstan both became Archbishops of Canterbury It was also around this time that Wells Cathedral School was founded

The present structure was begun under the direction of Bishop Reginald de Bohun who died in 1184 Wells Cathedral dates mainly from the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries the nave and transept are masterpieces of Early English architecture It was largely complete at the time of its dedication in 1239

The bishop responsible for the construction was Jocelyn de Wells one of the bishops at the signing of Magna Carta Jocelyns buildings included the Bishops Palace a choristers school a grammar school a hospital for travellers and a chapel He also built a manor at Wookey near Wells The master mason associated with Jocelyn was Elias of Dereham Jocelyn lived to see the church dedicated but despite much lobbying of Rome died in 1242 Cathedral status was granted in 1245 Masons continued with the enrichment of the West Front until about 1260

King John was excommunicated between 1209 and 1213 During this time work on the cathedral was suspended In this period building methods advanced so that bigger blocks of masonry could be moved and put into the walls The effect of this advance can be seen on the walls of the cathedral at a point in the buildings walls the blocks of stone increase in size

By the time the building was finished including the Chapter House it already seemed too small for the developing liturgy in particular the increasingly grand processions A new spate of building was therefore started by Bishop John Drokensford He heightened the central tower and began a dramatic eight sided Lady chapel at the far east end finished by 1326 Thomas of Whitney was the master mason

Bishop Ralph of Shrewsbury followed He continued the eastward extension of the quire He also built Vicars Close and the Vicars Hall to give the men of the choir a secure place to live and dine away from the town with all its temptations He enjoyed an uneasy relationship with the citizens of Wells partly because of his imposition of taxes He surrounded his palace with crenellated walls and a moat and drawbridge The Palace was now a castle

The appointment of William Wynford as master mason in 1365 marked another period of activity He was one of the foremost architects of his time and apart from Wells was engaged in work for the king at Windsor and at New College Oxford University and Winchester Cathedral Under Bishop John Harewell he built the south west tower of the West Front and designed the north west which was built to match in the early 15th century Inside the building he filled in the early English lancet windows with delicate tracery

In the fourteenth century the central piers of the crossing started sinking under the weight of the crossing tower Scissor arches were inserted to brace and stabilize the piers as a unit The building was now complete and it looked much as it does today

A Galilee porch was added under Bishop Eustace in the Early English Gothic style It was originally a two storey structure where liturgical processions could gather before entering the nave It was opened up into a single vaulted space in the 18th century Several details of its decoration particularly the syncopated arches and the use of Purbeck marble shafts reflect the influence of St Hughs Choir at Lincoln Cathedral built a few years earlier

Work began on a new eastern end in 1234 replacing the short Norman chancel with a much grander 10 bay structure Northwolds chancel completed by around 1252 adopted several of the stylistic elements already used in the Galilee porch

A Lord received a piece of land usually from a higher nobleman or from the king When he received the land he also received all that was on it That means that most of the people that lived on the land also belonged to the nobleman The people called peasants had to pay to the lord or they had to work for him This way the nobleman could live and support his family from what he received from the peasants He had also certain legal powers like that of a police force The peasants where subjects which had to pay tribute to the lord In return they received protection 

The tribute the subjects had to pay varied it could either be that they had to do work for their lord or that had to pay a certain part of what they earned That meant that if they grew some form of corn the lord got a tenth of their earnings in corn This is also often called payment in nature Very rarely it was money they had to pay

Manors each had up to three different classes of land 

Sometimes the lord had a mill a bakery or a wine press This could be used by the peasants against a fee Similarly the right to hunt or to let pigs feed in his woodland was subject to a fee The peasants could use the legal system to settle their disputes  for a fee Single payments were due on each change of tenant On the other side of the account manorial administration involved significant expenses This might be one of the reasons why smaller manors tended to rely less on villein tenure 

Dependent holdings were held nominally by arrangement of lord and tenant but tenure became in practice almost universally hereditary with a payment made to the lord on each succession of another member of the family Villein land could not be abandoned at least until demographic and economic circumstances made flight a viable proposition nor could they be passed to a third party without the lords permission and the customary payment 

Though not free villeins were by no means in the same position as slaves they enjoyed legal rights subject to local custom and had recourse to the law subject to court charges which were an additional source of manorial income Sub letting of villein holdings was common and labour on the demesne might be commuted into an additional money payment as happened increasingly from the 13th century 

This description of a manor house at Chingford Essex in England was recorded in a document for the Chapter of St Pauls Cathedral when it was granted to Robert Le Moyne in 1265

Feudal society is based on two principles that of feudalism and manorialism The structures of manorialism varied though In the later Middle Ages areas of incomplete or non existent manorialisation persisted while the manorial economy underwent substantial development as economic conditions changed

Not all manors had all three kinds of land as an average demesne accounted for roughly a third of the arable area and villein holdings rather more but some manors consisted solely of demesne others solely of peasant holdings Similarly the proportion of unfree and free tenures could vary greatly This meant that the amount of wage labour to perform agricultural work on the demesne varied as well The proportion of the cultivated area in demesne tended to be greater in smaller manors while the share of villein land was greater in large manors providing the lord of the latter with a larger potential supply of obligatory labour for demesne work The proportion of free tenements was generally less variable but tended to be somewhat greater on the smaller manors 

Manors varied also in their geographical arrangement most did not coincide with a single village Often parts of two or more villages belonged to the manor or were shared between several manors This situation sometimes led to replacement by cash payments of the demesne labour obligations of those peasants living farthest from the lords estate 

The demesne was usually not a single plot of land It consisted of some land around the central house and estate buildings The rest of the demesne land was in the form of strips dispersed through the manor In addition the lord might lease free tenements belonging to neighbouring manors as well as holding other manors some distance away to provide a greater range of produce 

Not all manors were held by laymen lords who rendered military service or paid cash to their superior A substantial share belonged directly to the king and a greater proportion were held by bishops and monasteries Ecclesiastical manors were usually larger with a significantly greater villein area than the lay manors next to them 

The effect of circumstances on manorial economy is complex and at times contradictory upland conditions have been seen as tending to preserve peasant freedoms on the other hand some such areas of Europe have been said to show some of the most oppressive manorial conditions while lowland eastern England is credited with an exceptionally large free peasantry in part a legacy of Scandinavian settlement

Similarly the spread of money economy is often seen as having stimulated the replacement of labour services by money payments but the growth of the money supply and resulting inflation after 1170 initially led nobles to take back leased estates and to re impose labour dues as the value of fixed cash payments declined in real terms

Today the term is used most to refer to medieval Western Europe A similar system was used in the rural parts of the late Roman Empire The birthrate and population were declining Labor was therefore the most important factor for production Successive administrations tried to stabilise the imperial economy by freezing the social structure into place sons were to succeed their fathers in their trade

Councillors were forbidden to resign and coloni the cultivators of land were not to move from the demesne they were attached to They were on their way to becoming serfs Several factors conspired to merge the status of former slaves and former free farmers into a dependent class of such coloni Laws of Constantine I around 325 reinforced both the negative semi servile status of the coloni and limited their rights to sue in the courts Their numbers were augmented by barbarian foederati who were permitted to settle within the imperial boundaries

As the Germanic kingdoms succeeded Roman authority in the West in the fifth century Roman landlords were often simply replaced by Gothic or Germanic ones with little change to the underlying situation The process of rural self sufficiency was given an abrupt boost in the eighth century when normal trade in the Mediterranean Sea was disrupted The thesis put forward by Henri Pirenne disputed by many supposes that the Arab conquests forced the medieval economy into even greater ruralisation and gave rise to the classic feudal pattern of varying degrees of servile peasantry underpinning a hierarchy of localised power centres

The Mediterranean Ridge is a wide ridge in the floor of the Mediterranean Sea It is next to a rough quarter circle from Calabria south of Crete to the southwest corner of Turkey and from there eastwards south of Turkey with Cyprus From what tectonic theory says it is caused by the African Plate subducting under the Eurasian and Anatolian plates As the African Plate moves slowly north northeastward it plows up the floor of the Mediterranean lifting it from the seabed and then above sea level making the island of Cyprus

If the northward movement of Africa continues the Ridge might grow into a long and high mountain range and destroy the Mediterranean Sea

Kirbys Adventure is a platform game The player has to get to the end of each level by walking jumping and flying Each level has enemies and things that get in the way but sometimes these things also help Kirby If Kirby touches an enemy he loses a health point Sometimes Kirby meets a mini boss and he must beat it to go on

Unlike the first Kirby game Kirbys Adventure saves the game after each level Players can go back to any level in the world that they have played by going through doors There are seven worlds and each world has between four and six levels as well as a boss door and a Warp Star door Except for World 7 each world also has one or more mini games a place to pick up powers and an arena where Kirby fights a mini boss

Kirby can do four things Walk jump fly and inhale Kirby can go as high as he wants as long as nothing blocks him and he can fall back to the ground by exhaling The puff of air can hurt enemies and break blocks

The Victorian government passed a law on 30 October 1878 to make the Kelly gang outlaws This meant they no longer had any legal rights and could be shot by anyonerp91 Anyone who could capture any member of the gang alive or dead would be paid a reward of 500 or 2000 for all four men At this time the police did not know that Hart and Byrne were members of the gang The gang were seen at several places around north east Victoria They tried to cross the Murray River to go into New South Wales but the water was too deep The police had several large groups hunting for them

On 10 December 1878 the gang robbed the Australian National Bank at Euroa They had stopped at Faithful Creek station and held the people there prisoners They locked 22 people including farm workers hawkers and visitors into a storeroom Joe Byrne kept guard while the rest of the gang went into Euroa They went to the bank and said they had a message from McCauley the farm manager They got into the bank and held up the banks manager Robert Scott along with two tellers After taking all the money the gang forced Scott his wife family maids and tellers to go with them back to Faithful Creek They were locked up with the other hostages

The outlaws gave a display of horse riding and tricks which entertained and surprised their hostages After having supper and telling the people not to leave the farm for another three hours the gang left The crime was carried out without injury and the gang stole 2000

The police increased the reward on the Kelly Gang More police were sent to guard banks in the country Friends of the Kellys were locked in gaol The gang crossed the Murray River and rode convert60kmmi0lkoffabbron north into New South Wales They arrived in Jerilderie on Saturday 8 February 1879 They broke into the local police station and locked the two policemen Richards and Devine in the police cells The outlaws put on police uniforms and mixed with the local people They said that they were extra police from Sydney who had come to guard the town from the Kelly gang Ned Kelly took his horse to the blacksmith to get new horseshoes and told the man to send the bill to the New South Wales police force On Monday the gang rounded up various people and forced them into the back room of the Royal Mail Hotel While Dan Kelly and Steve Hart kept the hostages busy with drinks on the house Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne went to the telegraph office and cut down some of the poles and cut the wires They then went and robbed the local bank of about 2414 Kelly also burned all the townspeoples mortgage deeds in the bank When the gang left the town they were singing about two earlier bushrangers Ben Hall and Dan Morgan Hurrah for the good old times of Morgan and Ben Hallrp26

For the next 18 months the police were not able to find the Kelly gang They punished anyone they thought might be helping the gang More than 20 people were locked up in the Beechworth Prison for three months only because they were said to be friends of the gang None of these people were ever charged with a crime The government thought the Kelly gang might try and free their friends so they put up large iron gates on the entrance to the prison

Months before going to Jerilderie and with help from Joe Byrne Ned Kelly dictated a long letter The letter told his story about how he became a bushranger and the treatment of his family by the police It also told the story of the treatment of Irish Catholics by the police and the English and Irish Protestant farmers He even said there might be a revolution by people in north east Victoria to set up their own republicrp21

The Jerilderie Letter as it is called is a document of about 8300 words and has become a famous piece of Australian literature Kelly had written an earlier letter on 14 December 1878 to Donald Cameron a member of the Parliament of Victoria but it had been ignored The Jerilderie Letter was never published Kelly tried to find the editor of the local newspaper and get him to print the letter He finally gave the letter to Edward Living a teller at the bank Living kept the letter which was not re discovered until 1930 It was then published by the Melbourne Herald The handwritten letter was given to the State Library of Victoria in 2000 Kellys words are colorful rough and full of metaphors He said the police were big ugly fat necked wombat headed big bellied magpie legged narrow hipped splay footed sons of Irish bailiffs or English landlords 

The gang decided that Aaron Sherritt Joe Byrnes best friend was a police spy On the night of 26 June 1880 Dan Kelly and Joe Byrne went to Sherritts house in the Woolshed Valley near Beechworth and killed himrp155 The four policemen who were protecting him at the time hid under the bed and did not report the murder until the next day The outlaws knew that the police would send extra men to Beechworth by train to try and capture them Ned Kelly and Hart arrived in Glenrowan on 27 June and took 70 hostages at the Glenrowan Inn They knew that a train loaded with police was on its way They forced railway workers at Glenrowan to pull up the rail tracks to make the train crash The bushrangers wearing homemade armour would then capture any of the policemen that were alive after the crashrp153 With the police out of the way the Kelly Gang would then go into Benalla and rob the bankrp153 The captured police would be released when Ellen Kelly William Williamson and William Skillion were let out of gaolrp153 

But the plan to derail the police train failed The police protecting Aaron Sherritt were too scared to leave his hut and the murder was not reported until the next day The Kellys had to wait 24 hours longer for the police train than they had plannedrp161 The hostages were becoming difficult to control To keep them amused the outlaws held a dance in the hotelrp23 where Kelly danced a quadrille with Jane Jones daughter of the hotel ownerrp161 They also had sporting events including the hop step and jump Kelly used two revolvers as extra weights while taking part in the jumpingrp160 A local school teacher Thomas Curnow talked Ned into letting him take his family home As soon as he was free Curnow went down to the railway line waving a lantern wrapped in his red scarfrp161 The train stopped safely 

The 46 police quickly left the train and placed themselves around the hotel so that the Kelly Gang was trapped inside The gang members put on their armour made from plough parts All four had helmets Each mans armour was quite heavy Neds armour weighed convert414kglb0lkonabbron which was about half his body weight The police fired their guns into the building for seven hours It is estimated that 15000 bullets were fired during the shooting The police ordered a cannon from Melbourne so that they could destroy the innrp162 but it would take too long to arrive so they set fire to the building instead

At dawn on Monday 28 June Ned Kelly came out of the inn wearing his armour He marched towards the police firing his gun at them Their bullets bounced off his armour He was shot in his legs that armour did not cover Joe Byrne died in the front room from loss of blood because a gunshot cut his femoral arteryrp161 Dan Kelly and Steve Hart may have killed themselves as their bodies were found lying side by side in a back room with their heads on blanketsrp191 They had taken off their armour and it was found next to them Several hostages were shot and three died including 13 year old Jack Jones the son of the hotel ownerrp23 Martin Cherry a railway worker was rescued from the burning hotel but died soon afterwards George Metcalfe a quarry worker who was forced to pull up the railway line died later from injuries The police had one small injury the police Superintendent Francis Hare received a wound to his wrist then fled the battle The Royal Commission set up to examine the Kelly Gang later removed Hare from the Victoria Police

Ned Kelly was taken to the Melbourne Gaol where he was treated for his wounds He was visited by his mother who was in the same prison for wounding Constable Fitzpatrickrp208 In August he was taken back to Beechworth by train for the first court hearingsrp210 The court agreed that Kelly would be tried in court for the murder of Thomas Lonigan and Michael Scanlon at Stringybark Creek The government thought people around Beechworth might not find Kelly guilty of the crimes and so they had the trial moved to Melbournerp220 At the trial the jury found Kelly guilty of both murders He was sentenced to death by the Irish born judge Sir Redmond Barry with the words May God have mercy on your soul Kelly said I will go a little further than that and say I will see you there when I gorp227 

Many people did not think Kelly should die after all on what has happened A petition with more than 60000 names asked for mercy He was hanged on 11 November 1880 at the Melbourne Gaol for murder Several newspapers including The Age and The Herald reported Kellys last words as Such is life Sir Redmond Barry died after a short illness on 23 November 1880 12 days after Kelly

Ned Kelly was buried in an unmarked grave at the Melbourne Gaol in an area with other criminals who had also been hung at the gaol The bones of 32 people were dug up in 1929 when the gaol was being redeveloped and reburied at Pentridge Gaol in Coburg Victoria The burial site at Pentridge was rediscovered in 2008 DNA testing has proved that one set of bones was the skeleton of Ned Kelly Experts from the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine said that the DNA clearly matches one of Kellys living relatives The bones show some of the injuries Kelly got during the shoot out with the police The Kelly skeleton does not have a skull

A skull said to be Kellys was found during the digging at the gaol in 1929 It was put on display at the Old Melbourne Gaol but it was stolen in 1978 On the anniversary of Ned Kellys hanging 11 November 2009 a farmer from Western Australia gave a skull back to Heritage Victoria which he said had been taken from the gaol It was tested for DNA to see if it was Ned Kellys skull These tests showed it was not and the location of Kellys skull is still unknown

Ned Kelly is still a major part of Australian popular culture His story has been told in books movies plays and television shows His image has been used for everything from cakes to tattoos A recent study showed that people with a Ned Kelly tattoo were eight times more likely to be murdered In 1980 the Australian Post Office released a set of postage stamps to remember the 100th anniversary of the siege at Glenrowan In 2010 the National Gallery of Victoria paid AU22 million for a painting of Ned Kelly by artist Sidney Nolan It was Nolans paintings of Ned Kelly that inspired the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney In June 2011 the Williamstown Australian Rules Football Club claimed that Ned Kelly had played 11 games for the club in 1873 while serving time in the prison ship It was also claimed that in 1928 they had found a suit of armour buried on the football ground

Ben Hall was an Australian bushranger A bushranger is a thief who roamed the countryside and country towns of Australia usually escaping on horseback like a highwayman Most bushrangers were simply criminals and thieves Ben Hall is one of the few bushrangers like Ned Kelly who were thought of as outlaw heroes 

Ben Hall lived at a time when gold had been discovered in New South Wales and Victoria Thousands of people went out to the places where gold had been discovered to seek their fortunes and hoping to get rich Like many bushrangers Ben Hall and his gang robbed coaches that were carrying gold from the goldfields Ben Hall was able to avoid being arrested by the police for many years because he had many friends and relatives to help him 

 Background the outlaw hero In folklore a typical outlaw hero is a farmer or other innocent person who is forced into crime by cruel police or government actions Ben Hall is part of a long history of outlaw heroes that includes people like Robin Hood in England and Jesse James in the United States The outlaw hero is said to be a friend of the poor kind to women and children and an enemy of the rich He is said to have died bravely in a battle against the more powerful forces of the law Ben Hall has been seen by people in Australia as such a hero others see him as a very clever criminal who stole a lot of money 

Ben Hall was born on May 9 1837 at Wallis Plains near Maitland in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales His parents were Benjamin Hall and Eliza Somers Both of his parents were convicts and sent to gaol in New South Wales They married in 1834 Ben was their fourth child After they were let out of gaol they moved to the Hunter Valley Benjamin worked for Samuel Clift on a farm called the Doona Run Around 1839 Benjamin moved to a broken wikt linkremoteremote valley north of Murrurundi He built a hut and began farming cattle He also found wild cattle and horses in the nearby hills In 1842 he bought a small block of land at Haydonton near Murrurundi and started a butcher shop The family worked hard but there were problems with the police over stolen cattle and horses Near the end of 1850 Benjamin moved down to the Lachlan River area taking his children Ben William and Mary and his stepson Thomas Wade

After his father died in 1851 Ben worked on many cattle farms along the Lachlan River He was known as a hard working and honest stockman On February 29 1856 at the age of 19 Hall married Bridget Walsh a farmers daughter at Bathurst On August 7 1859 they had a son whom they named Henry One of Bridgets sisters was the mistress of bushranger Frank Gardiner another sister married John Maguire In 1860 Ben Hall and John Maguire leased the Sandy Creek farm of convert10000acreha0lkonabbron about convert50kmmi0lkonabbron south of Forbes Hall built a house sheds and stockyards He raised cattle that he sold at the Lambing Flat goldfield He met Frank Gardiner who had a butchers shop at Lambing Flat

Historians are unsure why but Halls life changed By early 1862 his marriage was in trouble Biddy left Ben and moved in with a neighbour Jim Taylor taking young Henry with her There were many criminals living and working in the area where Hall lived He became friends with Frank Gardiner Gardiner was already wanted for robbery and had shot two policemen before escaping On April 14 1862 Gardiner and Hall robbed three bullock wagon drivers One week later the drivers saw him at the Forbes horse races Police Inspector Sir Frederick Pottinger who was also at the races told the police to arrest Ben for using guns in a robbery with Gardiner The jury at the courthouse at Orange did not think there was enough evidence to show that Hall had been one of the robbers After he was released the police kept a close watch on Ben Hall to see where he went and what he was doing 

On 15 June 1862 Gardiner and a group of ten men including Hall robbed the Forbes gold coach near Eugowra This coach carrying gold from the gold fields had an escort of police escort to guard it The gang stole more than 14000 in gold and money This is about US4 million in 2003 money value This was Australias biggest gold robbery Hall and several others were arrested in July Once again the police were unable find proof that Hall was one of the robbers The police let him go at the end of August When Hall went back to his farm he found his house burned down His cattle had been left in the stockyards and had died from starvation There are claims that this was done by Pottinger to punish Hall but not all historians agree Hall and John Maguire needed money to pay their legal costs They were forced to sell the lease of their farm at Sandy Creek to a Forbes hotel owner called John Wilson 

With his wife young son and his farm gone Ben Hall slowly moved into a life of crime as a bushranger On March 1 1863 Hall and bushrangers Patrick Daley and John OMeally were nearly captured in the Weddin mountains by Police Inspector Norton and black tracker Billy Dargin Black trackers were aboriginals used by the police for their skills in following people in the bush After shooting at each other Norton was captured and robbed Dargin managed to escape into the bush Hall and Daley chased Dargin through the bush for convert8mikm0lkonabbron When they caught him they told him they admired his bravery They let him go but told him they would rob the police camp that night While the police were out looking for them the gang stole guns and ammunition from the police camp The police chased them but the gang had stolen better and faster horses and easily escaped

Frank Gardiner went to Queensland to hide from the police after the Eugowra robbery Hall took over as leader of the gang For three years Hall carried out well planned and daring crimes They robbed mainly farmhouses stagecoaches carrying mail and gold and country hotels Halls gang included John Gilbert as his lieutenant his main helper In 1863 the other three members were John OMeally John Vane and Michael Burke Burke was only 17 years old He was shot and killed on October 24 1863 during a robbery at Henry Keightleys house at Dunns Plains Vane wanted to shoot Keightley for killing Burke but Ben Hall stopped him Instead he asked for a 500 ransom Mrs Keightley had to ride to Bathurst at night to get the money from the bank A few weeks later on November 19 OMeally was shot and killed during an attempted robbery on Goimbla Station Vane gave himself up and was sent to gaol Two other men James Mount and John Dunleavy joined the gang but were soon captured In May 1864 Hall and Gilbert were joined by John Dunn

The police seemed powerless to stop the Ben Hall gang The gang were very busy in the district during 1864 For example

Halls gang robbed Robinsons Hotel in Canowindra and held all the people of the town hostage for three days Nobody was hurt and Hall even got the people to play music and dance The local policeman was locked in his own cell When the people were set free Hall paid them money The gang paid the hotel owner for the food and drink that they had used The capture of the town is made famous in a song called John Gilbert

The gang was regularly robbing people and holding up the mail coaches south of Goulburn on the main Sydney to Melbourne Road On November 15 1864 the gang tried to rob the Gundagai Yass mail coach near Jugiong While waiting for the coach the gang captured and robbed over 60 people who were traveling along the road One of those captured was a policeman James McLaughlin He fired six shots at the gang but did not have any more ammunition and gave himself up The policeman on the coach William Roche was ordered by Police Magistrate Alfred Rose who was riding inside not to shoot and draw fire The driver Bill Geoghegan ordered him to get off the coach or he would kick him off Hall and Dunn began firing at two other policemen who were riding behind the coach Sub Inspector William ONeill was quickly captured John Gilbert and Sergeant Edmund Parry were shooting at each other from a close distance Gilbert shot dead Sergeant Parry Constable Roche escaped into the bush The gang quickly took all the money and valuable items and rode away Parry is buried at Gundagai On his headstone it says Edmund Parry Sergeant of the NSW Police who lost his life in the execution of his duty whilst courageously endeavouring to capture the bushranger Gilbert by whom he was shot dead near Jugiong Two days later the gang robbed the mail coach between Yass and Lambing Flat On December 5 they robbed the mail coach between Binalong and Burrowa

On Boxing Day 1864 Hall John Gilbert and John Dunn rode into the town of Binda with three local girls The girls were Christina McKinnon aged 25 believed to be Halls lover Ellen Monks aged 17 and her sister Margaret Monks aged 19 Together with the girls the gang robbed a shop owned by Edward Morriss They locked all the local people into the Flag Hotel They made everyone dance to celebrate Boxing Day Morriss got out of the hotel through a back window at 200 am and set off to tell the police Gilbert fired several shots at him Hall got angry and so he set fire to Morrisss shop and burned it down The gang and the girls left the town Christina McKinnon and Ellen Monks were arrested for helping the bushrangers and were sent to Sydney for trial Morriss joined the police force

The police were under a lot of pressure to catch the Ben Hall gang The gang had been able to travel around the country and go anywhere they liked They made the police look like fools Sir Frederick Pottinger came up with an unusual plan He knew the gang liked race horses and horse racing they had been seen at many country race meetings Pottinger planned to ride in the races at Wowingragong near Forbes on January 5 1865 He thought this would bring the gang out into the open where his men would be able to capture them The Ben Hall gang did not appear and Pottinger lost his job The Inspector General of Police thought that Pottinger had disgraced the police force by riding in races while he was supposed to be working Pottinger decided to go to Sydney to make the police force change its mind but on the way he accidentally shot himself and died

On January 26 1865 the gang held up ten people on the road near Goulburn They were chased into the bush by a group of policemen A couple of hours later the gang rode into the town of Collector Hall and Gilbert robbed the Commercial Hotel John Dunn stayed outside When the local policeman Constable Nelson arrived Dunn shot him dead at close range One of Nelsons nine children saw the shooting Gilbert robbed Nelsons body of money and other valuables and took his gun They left the town quickly and went into hiding 

The police put more effort into the hunt for the bushrangers In February they went to a house near Queanbeyan and found the gang had only just left The police thought that the gang might be with a friend Thomas Byrne They went to the Breadalbane Hotel and arrested four men that were known to be friends of the gang This would stop them giving the bushrangers any warnings The police surrounded Byrnes farm As they moved passed the open door of the barn the bushrangers began shooting One policeman Wiles was shot in the hand and the leg The bushrangers escaped into the bush but Ben Hall was shot as he ran away

On March 4 1865 the gang robbed the mail coach at between Goulburn and Gundaroo A couple of days later they stole horses from two farms On March 13 the gang tried to hold up the Araluen gold coach Gold had been found at Araluen in the 1860s The gold coach had a policeman with a gun sitting next to the driver There were two more policemen on the back of the carriage Four more policemen rode on horses in front and behind the coach The gold was kept in a safe which was bolted to floor of the coach The bushrangers began shooting at the coach Constable Kelly was shot in the chest He was badly hurt but he crawled to side of the road and began shooting at the bushrangers The police were able to keep the bushrangers away from the coach Another policeman Trooper Byrne was shot in the foot The bushrangers quickly left when miners with guns arrived from the town

In two years Ben Halls gang as well as killing two policemen had reportedly robbed 10 mail coaches held up 21 properties stole 23 racing horses and taken over the village of Canowindra three times

In early 1865 the government made a new law to help capture Ben Hall John Gilbert and John Dunn The Felons Apprehension Act was rushed quickly through the New South Wales Parliament They made Hall and his friends outlaws This meant that they could be killed by anyone at any time without warning They also put a reward of 1000 for the capture of Ben Hall

The bushrangers still kept busy robbing people They robbed a farm Wallendbeen Station and wanted to know where the police were A group of Chinese gold miners were robbed and one was shot in the leg by Gilbert The next day March 18 the police found the gang trying to take horses from Wallendbeen In the shooting Gilbert shot Senior Constable Keane in the shoulder Sergeant Murphy shot Gilbert in the arm The gang escaped into the bush They made their way to a shepherds hut and forced the shepherd to put a bandage on Gilberts arm Hall and Dunn walked to a nearby farm Beggan Beggan station They held up the 16 farm workers and took horses saddles and bridles They went back to get Gilbert and then robbed the farm again taking guns ammunition and food

Hall Gilbert and Dunn robbed the bank in Forbes and took 81 on March 25 More police were sent to the area and they were given better guns A month later the gang were seen near Marengo Two days later they took horses and food from another farm Yamma station This was the gangs last robbery

By May 1865 Ben Hall decided to leave New South Wales But a man Goobang Mick who had once given the gang help told the police where Hall was hiding During the night a group of eight policemen found Hall sleeping under a tree at Billabong Creek near Forbes The police were armed with double barrelled shotguns and 56 calibre Colt rifles Led by sub Inspector Davidson the police placed themselves in a large circle around Ben Hall When he woke up at dawn on 5 May 1865 Hall was shot in the back 30 times as he tried to run away A newspaper report said his body was riddled with bullets He did not shoot his pistol once The first rifle shots of the police cut his belt in two and his guns fell to the ground Goobang Mick was given a 500 reward The police were given another 500 reward ImageCaptureofBenHalljpgNewspaper drawing of Ben Halls death ImageBillabong creek panjpgThe site of Ben Halls death at Billabong Creek ImageBen Hall graveJPGBen Halls grave at Forbes 

Ben Halls body was put in a sack tied to a horse and taken back to Forbes An official inquest was held in the court house to find out how he died Ben Hall was broken wikt linkburiedburied in Forbes Cemetery on Sunday May 7 1865A lot of people went to see him buried The first wooden grave marker and fence were burnt in a bushfire Two brothers from Forbes the Pengilly brothers put a headstone on the grave in the 1920s The tree that Hall slept under before he was shot dead became an attraction People in the 1920s were still able to see bullets in the tree trunk The tree was destroyed in a bushfire in 1926 His grave is well looked after and many people still come to look at it Ben Halls gun a Colt pistol is now in the National Library of Australia

Gilbert and Dunn were nearly caught by the police a week later at Binalong Gilbert was shot dead as he tried to run away Dunn got away but six months later a friend told the police where Dunn was hiding He was captured tried for murder and hanged in Sydney on March 19 1866

In 2007 Peter Bradley a descendant of Halls younger brother Henry said he wanted to reopen the inquest into the bushrangers death Bradley said that the Felon Apprehension Act was not yet law when Hall was killed The first inquest found that Hall was deliberately killed but this was allowed because the new law meant Hall was an outlaw The parliament had passed the law on April 12 but it did not become law until May 10 This was 5 days after Hall was shot to death by police

There is memorial called Ben Halls Wall at Breeza south of Gunnedah New South Wales Ben Halls Gap National Park is a small section of State Forest south of Nundle New South Wales It is not named after the bushranger but after his father Benjamin Hall

Bahadur believed that Muslims were in a bad position in India because of their strong views India at the time was occupied by the British It was only in 1947 that it became independent Bahadur therefore introduced the western style of scientific working and organised Muslim Intellectuals

He also thought that all Indian Muslims should use Urdu to talk to each other

He was unhappy about the position of Muslims in India as their social and economic status was declining According to Sir Syed Muslims had to bring a positive approach to the British and accept their ways of education He wanted the Muslims to benefit from the British To achieve this task he had to bring about cooperation between the Muslims and the British To do this he did the following things wrote the loyal Muhammadans of India to prove that Muslims were not disloyal to British and to ask the British to end their hostility wrote a pamphlet essay on the causes of Indian Revolt and pointed out the reasons for the outbreak of 1857 This pamphlet was circulated for free amongst the British officials wrote Tabyin ul kalam to point out similarities between Islam and Christianity Established the British Indian Association

Sir Syed played a vital role in the educational uplift of the Muslims in India He did the following things to improve the educational standards setup a journal Tahzib ul Akhlaq which contained articles of influential Muslims who agreed with Sir Syeds approach towards education founded scientific society in Ghazipore in 1863 Opened school in murdabad in 1859 Opened school in ghazipore in 1864 Made a committee to raise funds for new schools Setup Muhammadan Anglo Oriental school in Aligarh on 24 May 1875 Setup Muhammadan educational conferences in 1866 to raise the standards of education

Sir Syed also increased the political awareness of Muslims in the Sub continent At first he believed in Hindu Muslim unity but later resolved to the two nation theory in 1885 the Indian national congress was setup and it claimed to be the body of every Indian regardless of the religion However it later proved to be functioning only for the Hindus and tried to eradicate the Muslims The Congress made three demands 1political representation according the population This obviously meant Hindu domination as they were a dominant majority in India and Sir Syed opposed it 2Appointment in government should be by competitive examinations Sir Syed opposed this because he knew that the educational standards of the Hindus was much better than the Muslims 3The next official language should be Hindi replacing Urdu Urdu had a special place in the Muslim hearts and Sir Syed opposed this This demand was accepted by the British

Sir Syed Ahmed Khan played a vital role in improving the Muslim status He worked tirelessly to restore relatiojns between the Muslims and the British He brought the Muslim revival through the Aligarh movement and showed the importance of education He brought about the Two nation theory and is hence known as The Father of The Pakistan Movement

Dabeer ul Mulk Najm ud daulah Mirza Asadullah Baig Khan pen name Ghalib and Asad was an all time great classical Urdu and Persian poet of the Indian subcontinent Most notably he wrote several ghazals during his life which have since been interpreted and sung in many different ways by different people He is considered to be the most popular and influential poet of the Urdu language

ghalib Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib led a revolution in Urdu poetry with his words According to the critic Aal Ahemd Sarvar Ghalib gave brain to our poetry which was till then dominated by the people of heart  Ghalib used to have takhallus of Asad but he listened to this sher 

Asad us jafaa par butoN say wafaa ki me ray sher shabaash rahmat kHuda ki 

He said whose sher is this should get lots of rahmat of God but if it is mine then lots of laanat on me and he changed his takhallus to ghalib 

the beginning He was born in 1796 in Akbarabad His father Abdullah Beg Khan and Uncle Nasrullah Beg Khan were in the Army Mirza Ghalib become orphaned when he was just 5 years old He lived with his uncle for 4 years when his uncle too died 

He started saying sher in Agra itself He married the daughter of Nawab Ilahi Baksh Maaroof and therefore moved to Delhi In Delhi he devoted his full concentration to poetry Soon he mastered the Persian language So that no one should call him be ustad he fabricated a story that he had an Iranian teacher Abdul samad live in house for two years to teach him Farsi Ghalib was always proud of his Farsi poetry but he is known more by his Urdu prose and poetry 

life He always lived his life lacking money After 1857 the support from the Royal durbar stopped The pension from the British Govt was stopped because he was suspected of supporitn the rebels He even traveled to Calcutta to restart the pension but to no avail  He went to the Nawab of Rampur who promised him Rupees 200 if he lived in Rampur and Rs 100 if he lived anywhere else His pension was resumed 3 years after that but all that money was used up for paying old debts Ghalib died in 1869 

letters Not only Urdu poetry but the prose is also indebted to Mirza Ghalib His letters gave foundation to the easy and popular Urdu Before Ghalib letter writing in Urdu was highly ornamental He made his letters talking by using words and sentences as if he is talking to the reader According to him sau kos say ba zabaan e qalam baateiN kiya karo aur hijr meiN visaal kay ma zay liya karo  from hundred of miles talk with the tongue of the pen and enjoy the joy of meeting even when you are separated His letters were very informal some times he will just write the name of the person and start the letter He himself was very humerous and also made his letter very interesting He said  maiN koshish karta hooN keH koi aisi baat likhooN jo pa Rhay kHoosh ho jaaye  I want to write the lines that whoever reads those should enjoy it When the third wife of one of his friends died he wrote Allah allah aik woH log haiN jo teen teen dafaH iss qaid say chhooT chu kaiN haiN aur aik hum haiN keH aik ag lay pachas baras say jo phaNsi ka phaNda ga lay meiN paRha hai to naH phaNda hi TuT ta hai naH dum hi nikalta hai Allah Allah there are some among us who have been freed from the prison three times and I have for the past 50 years this rope around my neck neither this rope breaks nor it takes my life Some scholars says that Ghalib would have the same place in Urdu litterature even only on the basis of his letters 

poetry 

In Urdu ghazals along with the love and beauty Ghalib added all the facets of life Because of him the canvas of Urdu ghazal became very extended 

Since Ghalib was very occuppied with Persian his earlier shers used difficult words and his flights of imagination was such that yaa to aap sam jhay yaa kHuda sam jhay  either you understand or the God understand 

Ghalib was not a philospher but he questioned things around him jub keH tujh bin nahiN koi maujood phir yeH hungaamaH ai kHuda kya hai  when there is no one besides you then oh God why is this pandemonium 

One also find naughtiness in his writings he makes fun of every thing and evreybody including himself  jiss meiN laakhoN baras ki hooreiN hoN aisi jannat ka kya ka ray koi  when the women are million years old what i will do with that paradise 

But Ghalibs sher not only have immediate effect on the heart but it makes you think too aah ko chahiye aik umr asar ho nay tak kaun jeeta hai teri zulf kay sar ho nay tak 

hum nay mana keH tagHaful naH karo gay lekin kHaak ho jaaayeN gay tum ko kHabar ho nay tak 

daame hur mauj meiN hai hulqa e sad kaam nihaNg dekheiN kya guz ray hai qat ray peH guhar ho nay tak

Translation

Better than the entire world is our India

We are its nightingales and it our garden abode

If we are in an alien place the heart remains in the homeland

Know us to be only there where our heart is

That tallest mountain that shade sharer of the sky is our sentry is our watchman

In its lap frolic those thousands of rivers

Whose vitality makes our garden the envy of Paradise

O the flowing waters of the Indus do you remember that day

When our caravan first disembarked on your waterfront

Religion does not teach us to bear ill will among ourselves

We are of Urdu our homeland is Pakistan

In a world in which ancient Yunan Misr and Roma have all vanished without trace

Our own attributes live on today

Such is our existence that it cannot be erased 

Even though for centuries the cycle of time has been our enemy

Iqbal We have no confidant in this world

What does any one know of our hidden pain

A number of Pokmon games have been released all on Nintendo systems as The Pokmon Company is owned by Nintendo

Most of the Pokmon games are based on catching training and battling Pokmon and the player is a Pokmon trainer who does all these things There are a number of aspects to the games

In the Pokmon games like the anime Pokmon are creatures that trainers catch train battle collect and trade with each other There are 649 of them and whether or not more will be made is unknown

The gameplay of the Pokmon series of role playing video games involves the capture and training of a variety of fictional creatures called Pokmon and using them to battle other trainers Each successive generation of games builds upon this concept by introducing new Pokmon items and gameplay concepts Some of the general concepts were featured elsewhere before being introduced in the games double battles appeared in the anime long before appearing in the games and Pokmon abilities are similar to the Pokmon Powers introduced in the Pokmon Trading Card Game

There are cards designed as various Pokmon which need Energy cards to use attacks There are also Trainer cards which are used for additional things other than direct Pokmon attacks Most fans of the series agree that a good deck is made of about twenty Pokmon cards twenty Energy cards and twenty Trainer cards

There is also a special kind of Pokmon in the trading card game called ex Pokmon ex Pokmon are stronger than regular ones but when they are knocked out the players opponent draws two of their prize cards Also there is another special type of pokemon in the trading card game called delta pokmon In the Diamond and Pearl trading card game expansion ex was changed to the Pokmon having levels of lv X In the Heartgold Soulsilver expansion they released new cards that are two cards but count as one pokemon and when knocked out the opponent gets two prize cards They are called Legends cards and are similar to ex cards

The Pokmon media franchise especially the anime has been often criticized by organizations

Porygon one of the main characters in the episode has not appeared again in the anime ever since Denn Senshi Porygon It has two evolved forms Porygon2 and Porygon Z and neither of them have appeared in the anime at all

An episode of The Simpsons called Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo made fun of Denn Senshi Porygon So did an episode of South Park called Chinpokomon

Jynx a species of Pokmon was criticized because it looked like it was using blackface It was also criticized because it looked like a drag queen This was not an issue in Japan but it caused a lot of controversy in the United States because of the United States history of racism Ever since then Jynx has purple skin instead of black skin and anime episodes featuring it were banned due to controversy

MINIX is a Unix like computer operating system based on a microkernel architecture Andrew S Tanenbaum wrote the operating system so it could be used for educational purposes MINIX also helped Linus Torvalds design the Linux kernel Its name comes from the words minimal and Unix

Released under the BSD license MINIX is free and open source

Andrew S Tanenbaum created MINIX at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam

MINIX 3 was announced to the public on 24 October 2005 by Andrew Tanenbaum during his speech on top of the ACM Symposium Operating System Principles conference MINIX 3 currently supports only IA 32 architecture PC systems It has a Live CD format that lets it be used on a computer without installing it Version 312 was released 8 May 2006 It contains X11 emacs vi cc gcc perl python ash bash zsh ftp ssh telnet pine and over 400 other common UNIX programs With the addition of X11 this version starts the change from a Text Only System 

The design principles Tanenbaum applied to MINIX had influenced the design decisions Linus Torvalds applied in the creation of the Linux kernel Torvalds used and appreciated MINIX but his design was different from the MINIX architecture in significant ways most notably by employing a monolithic kernel instead of a microkernel This was famously disapproved by Tanenbaum in the Tanenbaum Torvalds debate

In May 2004 Kenneth Brown of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution raised the accusation  that major parts of the Linux kernel had been copied from MINIX in a book called Samizdat

These accusations were refused by almost everyone  in particular by Andrew Tanenbaum who strongly felt that Kenneth Brown was very wrong and published a long rebuttal on his own personal website 

Its licensing fee was very small compared to the ones of other operating systems Although Tanenbaum wished for MINIX to be as easily available to students his publisher would not allow it

When freeopen source Unix like operating systems such as Linux became available in the early 1990s many volunteer software developers stopped using MINIX for Linux In April 2000 MINIX became freeopen source software under a permissive free software licence but by this time other operating systems were much better and it was mostly used as an operating system for students and hobbyists

Causality is a way to describe how different events relate to one another Suppose there are two events A and B If B happens because A happened then people say that A is the cause of B or that B is the effect of A 

What looks very simple is in fact a difficult problem Many people have tried to solve it they have come up with different solutions

Aristotle was an Greek philosopher He also looked at the problem of causality In his books Posterior analytics and Metaphysics he wrote

Aristotle told people of two types of causes proper causes and accidental causes Both types of causes can be spoken as potential or as actual particular or generic The same language refers to the effects of causes so that generic effects assigned to generic causes particular effects to particular causes and operating causes to actual effects It is also essential that ontological causality does not suggest the temporal relation of before and after  between the cause and the effect that spontaneity and chance are among the causes of effects belonging to the efficient causation and that no incidental spontaneous or chance cause can be prior to a proper real or underlying cause per se

All investigations of causality coming later in history will consist in imposing a favorite hierarchy on the order of causes such as final efficient material formal or in restricting all causality to the material and efficient causes or to the efficient causality or just to regular sequences and correlations of natural phenomena

David Hume was another philosopher who looked at the relation between cause and effect Hume thinks that there are certain things all such relations of cause and effect have in common

Hume says that if someone is used to always seeing the same things occur in the same order he will get accustumed to them being in that order When he sees one event occur he will expect the other to occur as well

Logic is the science that looks at how to build an argument In Logic there are usually two different types of causes They are called necessary cause and sufficient cause

Saint Thomas Church in Strasbourg is a Protestant church today It is very important for Strasbourg from a cultural and historic perspective Strasbourg Cathedral had to be given to the Catholics when the French occupied Strasbourg in 1681 Since then this church is the main Protestant church in the region 

The veneration of St Thomas at this particular spot was already present in the 6th century A church and a school were built there in the 9th century They burned down because lightning struck them in 1007 and again in 1144 A very large church built like a fortress to resist fires better was started in the year of 1196 Building works were interrupted several times until they finished with building side chapels in Gothic style In 1524 the church became Lutheran Today it is in charge of several schools There is also a seminary in the baroque building next to it 

There are 5 naves in the church It is the oldest such church in southwest Germany and the only hall church in Alsace The church is also known for its organs One of them was built by Johann Andreas Silbermann in 1741 The family Silbermann were the most important German organ builders of the 18th century Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart played on this organ several times during the three weeks he spent in Strasbourg in 1778 and wrote in a lettre to his father Leopold Mozart about it The other organ was designed by Albert Schweitzer and built in 1906 

There is a gothic fresco of Saint Michael in the church This is the largest of its kind in France after that of St Christopher in Wissembourg which is ten meters high

There are also many notable tombs and tombstones in the church the oldest is a romanesque masterwork from the 11th century and the largest a baroque monument to field marchal Maurice of Saxony that fills up the entire rear wall of the choir Maurice could not be buried in Paris because he was Protestant and since he was German by birth Strasbourg was a fitting place

The Saint Thomas church also houses medieval stained glass in its windows although Protestants destroyed parts of it in the early years of the Reformation

The NHL Entry Draft is an event in which the teams of the National Hockey League systematically select the rights to available amateur players who meet the requirements to play professional hockey in the NHL

Bishara went to Syria in 2001 He gave a speech at a memorial ceremony for Syrian President Hafez al Assad where he showed support for Hezbollah When he got back to Israel the government said that he was guilty of trying to cause violence and supporting a terrorist organization as defined by Israels Prevention of Terror Ordinance Bishara went back to Syria in September 2006 While he was there he said that Israel might attack Syria in more than one place to try to fix problems in Israel and show other countries that it would not be a good idea to attack it He also went to Lebanon He told the Lebanese prime minister that Hizbullah fighting against Israel has lifted the spirit of the Arab people Soon after this Interior Minister Roni Bar On asked Attorney General Menachem Mazuz see if Balad MKs Azmi Bashara Jamal Zahalka and Wassel Taha were guilty of any crimes because of their visit to Syria He did this because after Basharas visit to Syria in 2001 the Knesset made a law that said that MKs could not go to any enemy countries

On April 22 2007 Bishara resigned from the Knesset at the Israeli Embassy in Cairo Egypt He did this after a police investigation of foreign people he knew and talk with It was also said that he helped the enemy during wartime gave information on to the enemy and laundered money he got from foreign sources It was said that he might stay out of Israel because he did not want to go to jail and because it would end his political career He also said that he believed he would not get a fair trial

Court documents say that Bishara was questioned two times about the case During the second time he said that he was going to leave Israel for a couple of days He said he would attend a third questioning session when he got back to Israel Bishara talked to a group of supporters in Nazareth using a telephone in April 2007 He told the thousands of supporters that My guilt is that I love my homeland our intellect and our words are our weapons Never in my life did I draw a gun or kill anyone

People would send messages called telegrams to other people They would give the message to somebody using a telegraph who would send the message using Morse code Somebody using a telegraph on the other end would write down the message and give it to the person receiving the message After the 1930s it became cheaper to make long distance telephone calls than to send telegrams so fewer telegrams were sent Western Union an American company that used to send telegrams sent its last telegram in 2006

The awards were started by Maureen Dragone in 1979 to award child actors and singers for their work during the years 1978 and 1979 because she thought child actors didnt have a fair chance to win other awards given to adults like the Academy Award and the Golden Globe Award Two child actors who had to compete with adults for other awards that year were Ricky Schroder in The Champ and Justin Henry in Kramer vs Kramer The awards ceremony was held in November or December for the first 10 years but the ceremony is now held in March or April

The first Youth In Film Award was a small statue that looked like a small Academy Award It was a statue of a small golden man holding a wreath in front of his chest and he stood on a very large base that looked like a sports trophy The new Young Artist Award statue still looks like a small Academy Award but now the small golden man holds a star over his head and he stands on a much smaller base that is much easier for small children to hold All the winners are given the golden statue and all the children who are nominated are given a special plaque at the ceremony to remember their nomination

The children that the Young Artist Awards considers nominating are first suggested by the childs agent or manager and must be suggested before February A month later the Young Artist Awards throws a special party to announce the names of the children who they have decided to nominate The Youth In Film Awards were originally given to young artists up to the age of 21 but the awards are now given to children under the age of 18 most of the time   

Winners are chosen by the Young Artist Association The association was originally called the Hollywood Womens Photo and Press Club and its members were 88 journalists and photographers who worked in the arts Today the Young Artist Association has over 125 members who are journalists agents and former child performers The winners are picked by The Young Artist Association and past nominees who all vote by secret ballot

The first Youth In Film Awards gave awards in 11 competitive categories in 1979 The first categories for child artists were Best Juvenile Actor and Actress in a Motion Picture Best Juvenile Actor and Actress in a TV Series or Special Best Juvenile Actor and Actress in a Daytime TV Series and Best Male and Female Juvenile Recording Artist The Youth In Film Awards also gave awards to studios and networks in competitive categories for family friendly films and television shows 

Today the number of categories has grown to award Best Young Actor and Actress in an International Feature Film Best Young Actor and Actress in a Short Film Best Young Supporting Actor and Actress in Film Best Young Ensemble Cast Best Young Recurring Actor and Actress in a TV Series and Best Young Guest starring Actor and Actress in a TV Series Many of the categories have been split to award children age 10 and under in their own separate categories The Young Artist Awards has also awarded children for their work in other arts over the years including theater dance commercials journalism radio and stand up comedy

While the number of acting categories has grown some competitive categories like Best Juvenile Recording Artist Best Family Motion Picture and Best Family TV Series are no longer awarded The awards for those categories are now given as special Honorary awards The most well known Young Artist Honorary Awards are the Jackie Coogan Award which is given to film studios producers or directors for their Outstanding Contribution To Youth Through Entertainment and the Former Child Star Award which is given as a Lifetime Achievement Award to adults who were once child stars

The ceremony is held every year in Hollywood and is the most formal awards ceremony for children The child nominees and their parents are expected to dress up in suits or party dresses and many arrive in limousines Reporters and photographers are invited to the red carpet before the show to take pictures of the child stars when they arrive and and sign autographs The children chosen to announce the awards on stage each year are usually the winners from the year before or from the years list of nominees  After the ceremony is a formal dinner and then dancing with live music performed by popular child singers

The first Youth In Film Awards were given in November 1979 at a ceremony held at the Sheraton Universal Hotel in Hollywood California Other locations for the ceremony over the years are the Ambassador Hotels Coconut Grove the Globe Theatre the Beverly Garland Hotel and the Sportsmens Lodge

David was an important King of Israel He is described in the Old Testament books of 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel He was the father of King Solomon and an ancestor of Jesus

David was the youngest of eight sons of Jesse and the grandson of Ruth He was a shepherd like his father was While taking care of the sheep he would use a sling to keep wild animals from hurting them He would also play his harp And he wrote many of the songs found in the book of Psalms

When King Saul the first King of Israel left the Lord God sent an evil spirit in him to torment him He called David the shepherd to his palace because David was good at playing the harp and the soft music soothed Saul when he was being tormented by the evil sprit Saul liked him very much and David became one of his armor bearers So whenever the spirit from God came upon Saul David would take his harp and play Then relief would come to Saul he would feel better and the evil spirit would leave him He unknowingly puts in his court the person God chose to replace him

When David was about twelve years old his brothers had to go fight for Israel under the leadership of King Saul His father was worried about them and sent David to check on them When David arrived a giant Philistine enemy Goliath was mocking the Israelites and God saying Who will come and fight me If he wins we will be your slaves but if I win then you will be our slaves All the Israelites were afraid When David saw this he was very angry and he said I will go fight him His faith was very different from King Saul who not thinking about God immediately said You are not ableyou are only a boy But David said confidently The Lord who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine He was not confident of his own fighting skills but of the power of God whose honor has been hurt by the Philistines and whose covenant promises have been forgotten by the Israelites When King Saul saw that David was brave enough to fight Goliath he sent him Now he not only needed David for his broken wikt linksanitysanity but also to protect his kingdom Saul gave David his armour and weapons but they were too heavy for him David told Saul that he would use his slingshot instead He then used a smooth stone and hit Goliath in the forehead killing him instantly Using Goliaths own sword David cut off Goliaths head

Later because of Davids excellent fighting skills and brave loyalty to God King Saul appoints David in a high rank in the army Whenever David goes out to slay he comes back in victory and therefore all the people were pleased with him and King Saul treasured him very much But one day when King Saul was coming out to greet his people the women of the town came out singing and dancing with tamberines and lutes And as they danced they sang the famous song that most Christians know well Saul has slain his thousands and David his tens of thousands Saul hearing this song burst with fury and jealousy  and began to suspect that the people liked David more than him

Sauls jealousy then began to heat into hatred and he wanted to kill David but not yet with his own hand  and so he asked David to marry his daughter Merab but David refused politely and Merab was married to Adriel of Meholah Then he asked again for David to marry Michal who was in love with David David again refused Finally he asked him to bring a hundred Philistine foreskins and then he would give the bride over David was pleased to become Sauls son in law when he heard this and agreed Saul thought Now he will be killed by the Philistines hand But God was with David and he was not hurt Saul tells Jonathan and all the officials to kill David but Jonathan loved David very much and warned Saul not to Saul listened but later he grew angry again and keeps on trying to kill David Many times David does not kill Saul when he has a chance to but instead says How can I kill the Lords anointed and spares Saul and many times Saul blesses David and repents and determines to stop trying to kill David  but he always returns with a spear

In battle with the Philistines Sauls sons Jonathan Abinadab and Malki Shua are killed Saul is injured and he said to his armor bearer to kill him before these uncircumcised fellows will come and run me through and abuse me The armor bearer is too afraid to do it so Saul took his own sword and fell on it killing himself The armor bearer killed himself too So Saul and his three sons and his armor bearer and all his men died together that same day 

An Amalekite came to David and lied that he had killed Saul probably hoping that David would reward him David realizes that Saul is dead and he ripped his clothes and wept He was not happy to hear that Saul was dead and even killed the Amalekite thinking that he was Sauls murderer He was anointed again in front of everybody

Meanwhile Ish Bosheth the only son of Saul left was made king by Abner a relative of Saul The war between the house of Saul and the house of David lasted a long time David grew stronger and stronger while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker Later Abner slept with one of Sauls concubines and Ish Bosheth asked Why did you sleep with my fathers concubine Ish Bosheth suspected that Abner wanted to be king instead of him Abner became very angry and decided to help David instead However Joab the commander of Davids army did not like Abner because Abner had killed his brother Maybe he also thought his job as the leader of the army would not be safe if Abner helped David because Abner was very powerful in the northern tribes of Israel So Joab killed him by broken wikt linkstabstabbing him in the stomach David cursed Joab for murdering Abner and said that he did not join in the killing

When Ish Bosheth heard that Abner had died he became very worried the northern tribes were now without a strong leader Two men Recab and his brother Baanah killed Ish Bosheth in his house and brought his head to David saying This day the LORD has avenged my lord the king against Saul David was very angry and killed them cutting off the hands that had killed Ish Bosheth and the feet that had run with the news They buried the head of Ish Bosheth in Abners tomb

All the tribes of Israel then came to David and made him king over Israel

A few years after David had captured Jerusalem he asked Is there anyoneto whom I can show kindness for Jonathans sake remembering the promise he had made They found a servant of King Saul named Ziba who said that there was still a son of Jonathan who was broken wikt linkcripplecrippled in both feet named Mephibosheth David told Mephibosheth that he would get back all the land Saul had when he was king and that Mephibosheth would always eat at his table  a mark of great honor Mephibosheth bowed down and cried What is your servant that you should notice a dead dog like me From then on Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem and always ate at the kings table like one of Davids sons

One day David was walking around on the roof of his palace when he saw a very beautiful woman bathing David found out that her name was Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite who was one of Davids royal guards David sent messengers to get herand he slept with her Because of this David eventually broke the sixth seventh ninth and tenth commandments She soon became pregnant The law said that both David and Bathsheba must die for their sin David makes Uriah come back from battle and tried to make him go back home and sleep with Bathsheba so everybody will think it is Bathshebas son But Uriah does not go home saying The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in tentsHow could I go to my houseand lie with my wife His broken wikt linkdevotiondevotion shows how sinful David is Finally when David could not make him go home he decided to make Uriah die so he could marry Bathsheba himself quickly He said Put Uriah in the front line where the fighting is broken wikt linkfiercefiercest Then withdraw from him so he will be struck down and die Because of this Uriah died

David married Bathsheba but the thing David had done displeased the LORD So Nathan the prophet went and told him that he had done a very bad sin David saw he was guilty and was very sorry He said I have sinned against the Lord Nathan told David that he was forgiven and the LORD broken wikt linkmercymercifully did not make David die as the law said he must However Nathan said the son Bathsheba would give birth to would die After Nathan had gone home the child became sick and died David was very sad but humbly accepted the results of his sin Bathsheba had another son and they named him Solomon The LORD loved him and said to name him Jedidah This name showed that the LORD loved Solomon from when he was born and also showed that the LORD still loved David even though he had sinned

ImageBartolomew IjpgthumbrightThe current Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew IThe Ecumenical Patriarch is the Patriarch of Constantinople Today Constantinople is called Istanbul He is regarded to be the leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church He has been generally known as the Greek Patriarch of Constantinople There is also an Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople The older of the office is the Archbishop of Constantinople The office should also not be taken for the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople which no longer exists

The Assyrian Church of the East also called Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East is a Christian church It is one of the earliest churches to separate from the larger Church It traces its origins to the See of Seleucia Ctesiphon started by Saint Thomas the Apostle as well as Saint Mari and Addai as shown in the Doctrine of Addai This church is sometimes known as the Nestorian Church the Syrian Church or the Persian Church The church is currently headed by Mar Dinkha IV 

Other names have been given as well but they are not accurate One of these names is Assyrian Orthodox Church which has led some people to believe that it is part of the Oriental Orthodox community The church itself does not use the word Orthodox in any of its service books or in any of its official correspondence nor does it use any word which can be translated as correct faith or correct doctrine the rough translation of the word Orthodox In India it is known as the Chaldean Syrian Church In the West it is often known as the Nestorian Church The Church itself believes that the term Nestorian Church is chosen badly 

The Assyrian Church is the original Christian church in what was once Parthia eastern Iraq and Iran Geographically its influence stretched to China and India in the Middle Ages a monument found in Xian the Tang period capital of China in Chinese and Syriac described the activities of the church in the 7th and 8th century while half a millennium later a Chinese monk went from Beijing to Paris and Rome to call for an alliance with the Mongols against the Mamelukes Before the Portuguese arrival in India in 1498 it provided East Syrian bishops to the Saint Thomas Christians Patriarch Timothy I wrote of the large Christian community in Tibet

The creators of Assyrian theology are Diodorus of Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia Both taught at Antioch The normative Christology of the Assyrian church was written by Babai the Great and is clearly different from the accusations of dualism directed toward Nestorius his main christological work is called the Book of the Union and in it Babai teaches that the two qnome are unmingled but everlastingly united in the one parsopa of Christ

Psychotherapy describes the way specially skilled people called psychotherapists help people who have problems and unhappiness in their lives or who want to improve the quality of their lives and relationships with others

Psychotherapy means treatment of the mind It aims to help the person feel better be braver happier and more in control of their lives The main way they do this is by talking to the person who has the problems in a way that they begin to be able to understand themselves better A few psychotherapists may also touch the person to help them express how they are feeling Some psychotherapists may work with a group of people such as a family who have problems and are unhappy

Psychotherapists usually complete their training at the doctoral level through doctor of philosophy programs or medical school although some are trained at the masters level Psychotherapists do not use surgery or give drugs or electric shocks to the people they help These methods are used by special medical doctors called psychiatrists who may also sometimes give psychotherapy 

Psychotherapy was started in the west in 1886 by Sigmund Freud who is called the father of psychoanalysis the first modern psychotherapy Freud was a medical doctor who was trained in Neurology He became certain that hidden thoughts in the brain could cause physical symptoms and strange behavior in some people He believed that human behavior was not all caused by the brain but by things that happened to people when they were babies and young children His research of this theory the idea he had led him to create talking therapy psychoanalysis where he tried to figure out what could cause the mind to do things like this Freud thought that his figuring things out and telling the patients what had caused the behavior would cure the patient Unfortunately it usually made no lasting changes 

This is why modern psychologists have gradually figured out many other ways of helping their patients and modified their techniques through various types of psychotherapy

I just did some color changing My preference for the selected article section would be something light and kind of pastel so that it fits in with the color scheme for the rest of the page I think the lilac works nicely because the star is mainly brown and lilac 

On an unrelated note I think we should do a vote soon on the layout Im not entirely opposed to the vertical I kind of prefer the horizontal though I think if we stick with the vertical we should shorten the intro box Have you seen the changes I made to the header area on the main page I dont want to change it on your test page in case you dont like it You dont have to keep the color changes I made either its your proposal not mine I think no matter which layout the community chooses we should use your process of rotating the articles Im envious of people that can do that sort of stuff Tygartl1talk 1804 30 July 2007

I changed the heading to match the current main page For some reason the italics for those links has always bothered me not to mention that I think the links I have placed there are more useful than the ones I replaced In my humble opinion I think this way looks much cleaner and will ultimately be more helpful than the previous heading One thing that I do not know how to do is to change the width of the grey box around the Welcome so that it matches the width of the other boxes on the page Could someone do that Thanks Tygartl1talk 1550 18 August 2007

Ive been reading the code for the Very Good Article transclusion and I think its flawed and unnecessarily complex Generally Main Pages and Portals simply transclude a summary of rotating content from a previously created subpage using the formula CURRENTMONTH CURRENTDAY CURRENTYEAR This is also similar to the work involved in maintaining Portals I believe Ive read that we plan to rotate our VG every week right I can arrange this format and the code if you wish My experience with Portals at EnWP may come handy Love Phaedriel  1525 19 August 2007

Because of the large size gap between 1000 articles and 100 000 articles I rechecked each wiki in that grouping and split it up by adding the 10K category to denote medium sized wikis The 100K 1K 100 groupings just seem a little off as they would define Large Small and tiny rather than Large medium and small I also added a separator and centered the footer for that section The separator helps it stand away from the list of wikis a little and the centering keeps it in the same style as the footer information in the other sections on the page Revert either or both edits as needed  Creol 0628 20 August 2007

I switched to coding for VG article rotation to a once a week rotation The coding uses CURRENTWEEK rather than CURRENTDAY to base it one a weekly value It also takes advantage of the mod function rather than having to use IF statements to parse out an value for the page name This shortens the coding and makes it much simplier to vary the number of articles in rotation Finally it adds 1 to the value so we get a number between 1 and 10 rather than 0 to 9 so no changes to the Article pages needs to be made  Creol 1638 23 August 2007

Due to the large number of pages currently used for the main page categorization was required to consolidate the information The problem being that the Main Page itself should not have a category With 10 VG article pages and multiple subpages for the individual boxes on the main page and the test page a category for all of these pages was needed The category Main page is being used as the main source of all top level categories This did not seem the place to include everything for the main page itself A subcat in catwikipedia was probably the best place but of course I just thought of that idea as I was typing this sentence As such I placed the pages in the categoryProject which is mainly unused as it is the root for all categories and articles combined To prevent the categories from being transcluded into the main page with the rest of the information the  function was included for the category itself The test page includes the category directly As it is not commonly shown the category is not an issue Should the test page ever be copied over to the main page again the category needs to be removed during the transfer to keep the main page nice and clean and category free  Creol 0658 30 August 2007

With the main page itself being modified to accept information from subpages rather than including all the information on the main page the current version of the test page was not in sync with the main To prevent issues with new tweaks here causing problems when transferred to the main page I updated the test page to the current version of the main page so that any changes here will be easier to copy over should they be needed  Creol 0658 30 August 2007

The Requiem Mass in D minor K626 is a famous piece of music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart which he composed in 1791 This requiem was Mozarts last composition He wrote it as he lay dying himself It seems that he did not manage to finish it before he died and that it was finished by another musician called Franz Xaver Sssmayr We do not know exactly how much of the music is by Mozart and how much Sssmayr had to add There have been lots of stories and ideas about how the Requiem was composed and it is still a problem that is often discussed by musicians

Maria Theresia may mean

Gregorio Allegri was an Italian composer and priest He lived most of his life in Rome and died there

He composed a lot of church music By far the most famous of his compositions is the Miserere mei Deus often just referred to as Allegris Miserere There is a very famous story about this music

Miserere mei Deus is a motet written to be sung by two choirs one in which the singers are divided into five groups and the other in four groups One choir sings a simple kind of tune called a fauxbourdon which is based on a plainchant The other sings a more complicated version with a top part which goes up to top C

The piece is written in a traditional church style Allegri had learned composition from a friend of Giovanni da Palestrina the greatest church composer of the Renaissance However the style of Allegris music is more modern than Palestrina Allegri was writing in the early Baroque period

Allegri wrote the Miserere to be sung in the Popes Sistine Chapel The Vatican did not want anyone else to perform the music so no one was allowed to take the music away or make copies of it However when the 14 year old Mozart visited the Vatican in 1770 with his father he heard it twice went home and wrote all the music out from memory Mozarts copy of the music was sent to England where it was published by Dr Charles Burney There were no copyright laws in those days so there was nothing that the Vatican could do about it

In Greek mythology Pontus was an ancient pre Olympian sea god son of Gaia the Earth 

Pontus is a region on the southern coast of the Black Sea 

Homo floresiensis is a possible species in the genus Homo the biological family to which humans belong The remains were found in 2004 on the island of Flores in Indonesia Parts of the skeletons of nine individuals were found including one complete cranium The most important and obvious identifying features of H floresiensis are its small body and small size of the space for the brain inside the skull This is why the discoverers have called members of the species hobbits after JRR Tolkiens fictional race of roughly the same height 

A lot of research is done to find out if they are a different species to modern humans 

The remains were discovered on the Indonesian island of Flores by an Australian Indonesian team of archaeologists in 2003 Archaeologist Mike Morwood and colleagues were looking for evidence of the original human migration of H sapiens from Asia to Australia They were not expecting to find a new species They were surprised at the recovery of a nearly complete skeleton of a hominin They called it LB1 because it was unearthed inside the Liang Bua Cave Excavations done after that recovered seven additional skeletons dating from 38000 to 13000 years ago An arm bone which they think belongs to H floresiensis is about 74000 years old The specimens are not fossilized and have been described as having the consistency of wet blotting paper once exposed the bones had to be left to dry before they could be dug uprp86

Researchers hope to find preserved mitochondrial DNA to compare with samples from similarly unfossilised specimens of Homo neanderthalensis and H sapiens

This hominin is remarkable because it has a small body and brain There are also a lot of stone tools found in the cave The tools are of a size that could be used by the 1 meter tall human They are dated from 95000 to 13000 years ago They are found in the same archeological layer as an elephant of the extinct genus Stegodon They think that LB1 might have hunted this elephant The elephant would have been very common throughout Asia during the Quaternary Other animals that lived on the island at that time were giant rats Komodo dragons and even larger species of lizards Homo sapiens reached the region by around 45000 years ago

Archaeologist Mike Morwood and colleagues who found the remains published research to say that they think the individuals belong to a new species H floresiensis within the taxonomic tribe of Hominini Other members of this tribe are human bonobo and chimpanzee their ancestors and the extinct line of their common ancestor The discoverers also say that H floresiensis might have lived at the same time as modern humans on Flores

Not everyone agrees that this is a new species Indonesian anthropologist Teuku Jacob suggested that the skull of LB1 was a modern human with microcephaly This is a disorder that causes the bones of the head to stop growing Another study says that perhaps the individuals were born without a working thyroid which would result in the small size of the hominins because of a disorder called Myxedema ME

Two studies of the bones published in 2007 both reported evidence to support species status for H floresiensis A study of three bits of bones from the hand showed that they were similar to the carpal bones of a chimpanzee or an early hominin such as Australopithecus They were also different from the bones of modern humans A study of the bones and joints of the arm shoulder and legs also concluded that H floresiensis was more similar to early humans and apes than modern humans In 2009 the publication of a cladistic analysis and a study comparing body sizes gave further support for the theory that H floresiensis and Homo sapiens are separate species

They believe that the species has survived on Flores at least until 12000 years before present This makes it the longest lasting non modern human It also lived longer than the Neanderthals which became extinct about 24000 years ago

Because of a deep neighboring strait Flores remained isolated during the Wisconsin glaciation Because of this the discoverers of H floresiensis think that the species or its ancestors must have reached the isolated island by water transport around 100000 years ago 

Local geology suggests that a volcanic eruption on Flores approximately 12000 years ago was responsible for the end of H floresiensis and animals that lived on the island The elephant Stegodon also became extinct at this time Gregory Forth hypothesized that H floresiensis may have survived longer in other parts of Flores to become the source of the Ebu Gogo stories told among the local people 

The stories say that Ebu Gogo were small hairy language poor cave dwellers that are the same size as the Homo Floresiensis It is said that they were there at the time of the arrival of the first Portuguese ships during the 16th century These creatures are claimed to have existed as recently as the late 19th century Gerd van den Bergh a paleontologist working with the fossils reported hearing of the Ebu Gogo ten years before the fossil discovery On the nearby island of Sumatra there are reports of a 1 15m tall humanoid the Orang Pendek which might be related to H floresiensis Henry Gee senior editor at Nature magazine speculates that species like H floresiensis might still exist in the unexplored tropical forest of Indonesia

The province takes the name from the Tano name of the region Dahaboon it was also the name of the main river of the region

For a very long time very few people lived in this region because it was on the border between two countries first between the French colony of Saint Domingue and the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo and later between the two independent countries of Haiti and Dominican Republic There were many fights here between the armies of the two parts of the island and some important battles were held close to the city of Dajabn during the Dominican Independence War

In 1861 the Dominican Republic became again a colony of Spain The Restoration War or just the Restoration started on 16 August 1863 in a hill close to Capotillo The Spanish army left the country in 1865

After the Restoration people came to live in this area and several towns were created

In 2002 there were 62046 people living in the Dajabn province 31443 men and 30603 women There were 29218 living in towns and cities The population density was 61 personskm

The estimated population in the province for 2007 was of 69736 inhabitants 35477 men and 34259 women for a population density of 6911 personskm

The following table shows the municipalities with their populations in the 2002 census 

The Dajabn province has a total area of 102073 km It has 21 of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 23rd largest province

The Cordillera Central is in the southern part of the province The northern part is flat with many savannas it is part of the Yaque del Norte Valley

There are two main roads in the province One from north to south comes from the Monte Cristi province and goes through the cities of Dajabn Loma de Cabrera and Restauracin and then goes into the Elas Pia province In some parts the road marks the border with Haiti

The second main road begins in Santiago de la Cruz and goes to the east through Partido and El Pino and then through the Santiago Rodrguez and Valverde provinces to end in the Carretera Duarte one of the most important road of the country and that goes from Santo Domingo to Monte Cristi

The only important river in the province is the River Dajabn also known as Masacre This river marks the Dominican Haitian border from the city of Dajabn to its mouth Other rivers are very short and they are tributaries of the Dajabon or the Artibonite rivers

The climate of the province is a tropical climate hot most of the year but it is cooler on the mountains

There are five municipalities and four municipal districts in the province The municipal districts are similar to municipalities but they depend on a municipality

The municipalities and municipal districts are

As in all provinces on the Dominican Republic Haiti border there is little economic development The trade with Haiti is very important mostly in the city of Dajabn On the mountains coffee and beans are important products Rice and bananas are produced in the northern part of the province and cattle raising is important around the city of Dajabn

Memoir 

Screenplay 

Pattons widow was approached not long after her husband died with an offer to make a Hollywood movie about Pattons life and career His family did not agree right away and it was many years before they approved a dramatic movie to be made The movies screenplay was based on a well written biography of General Patton Patton Ordeal and Triumph and A Soldiers Story a broken wikt linkmemoirmemoir by General Omar N Bradley who served with Patton

The story covers the time from the American defeat at the Battle of the Kasserine Pass in North Africa during 1943 when Patton was sent to take command through his victories in Africa and Sicily his time as a broken wikt linkdecoydecoy before D Day The Battle of the Bulge and his last weeks after the war was over in 1945

The movie did not give much time to showing combat and battles but explained Pattons role in several important battles and campaigns It also showed his character as a person as a soldier and as a leader Patton made good choices such as appointing Omar Bradley to assist him and bad choices such as striking soldiers physically when they showed fear or cowardice or giving his personal opinions to the media when they differed widely from what the Allied commanders expected The movie showed a mix of both bad and good things about Patton

The movie appeared nearly twenty five years after Patton died American attitudes toward war toward fighting and toward the military had changed in many ways The Vietnam War was happening at the same time the movie was made and shown The older generation who had fought in World War II or helped out on the broken wikt linkhome fronthome front tended to support the war and the draft which made young American men join the Army to fight Younger people who did not remember World War II or were born after it ended were mostly against the war in Vietnam Patton gave older and younger viewers a look back at an American war hero and leader and it gave them things to think and talk about together

Le nozze di Figaro is an opera by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed in 1786 It was written in Italian The words are by Lorenzo da Ponte who based the story on a play Pierre Beaumarchais It was the first of three operas that Mozart wrote together with Lorenzo da Ponte the others are Don Giovanni and Cos fan tutte They are all comic operas

Although the play by Beaumarchais was at first not allowed to be performed in Vienna because it made fun of the aristocracy the opera became one of Mozarts most successful works The overture is especially famous and is often played as a concert piece 

The opera was a tremendous success when it was first performed in Vienna It was also extremely popular when it was produced in Prague later that year He was invited back the following year and asked to write a new opera for Prague so he wrote Don Giovanni

The whole story takes place in one day in the palace of the Count Almaviva in Seville in Spain Rosina is the Countess and her husband the Count wants to make love with a woman named Susanna who is about to be married to her true love Figaro the Counts servant The Countess has an page boy Cherubino who looks after her Cherubino however is starting to fall in love with the Countess The Count notices this and he tries to get rid of Cherubino by giving him the job of officers commission in his own army Figaro Susanna and the Countess plan together to embarrass the Count and show how he has being trying to get the attentions of Susanna Meanwhile Figaro has an argument with Bartolo and Marcellina which ends when it is shown that he is their son At night all these people find themselves in the palace grounds There is a lot of humour in which people do not recognize one another thinking they are someone different In the end it is shown that the Count has been unfaithful and he has to ask his wife to forgive him

Figaro and Susannas room

Figaro is measuring the bedroom to see how the new bed will fit in Susanna is trying on her wedding bonnet in front of the mirror Figaro is quite pleased with their new room but Susanna is not so sure She is worried because it is so near to the Counts rooms and she knows that the Count fancies her In the old days an important person such as a Count had the right to sleep with a servant girl on her wedding night before her husband could sleep with her It was a law that was becoming old fashioned at that time In the story the Count had stopped that law when he married Rosina but he now he wants it back again Figaro is very angry and makes plans against the Count

Figaro goes off and Dr Bartolo arrives with Marcellina his old housekeeper Marcellina has hired Bartolo as her adviser because Figaro had once promised to marry her if he was not able to pay back some money which she had lent to him and she wants that promise to come true Bartolo still annoyed with Figaro for having made it easy for the Count and Rosina to marry promises to help Marcellina It is a comic scene in which he makes fun of lawyers

Bartolo leaves Susanna comes back and Marcellina and Susanna are rude to one another in an over polite way Marcellina leaves angrily when Susanna refers to her age

Cherubino then arrives He sings a song in which he says he does not understand his new passionate feelings for women especially for the Countess He asks for Susannas help with the Count It seems the Count is angry with Cherubinos flirting ways He had discovered him with the gardeners daughter Barbarina and plans to punish him Cherubino wants Susanna to ask the Countess to try to change her husbands mind When the Count appears Cherubino hides behind a chair because he does not want to be seen alone with Susanna The Count uses the opportunity of finding Susanna alone to try to win her love even offering her money As Basilio the music teacher arrives the Count hides behind the chair because he does not want to be found in a room alone with Susanna Cherubino leaves that hiding place just in time and jumps onto the chair while Susanna scrambles to cover him with a dress Now the Count is behind the chair and Cherubino is on the chair covered by a dress

When Basilio starts to talk about how Cherubino is fond of the Countess the Count angrily leaps from his hiding place and he lifts the dress from the chair to show how he found Cherubino under a table in Barbarinas room and again he finds Cherubino The young man is only saved from punishment by the entrance of the poor workers of the Counts estate Figaro had organized this entrance of the workers He wants to force the Count to give up his ideas about sleeping with Susanna The Count says he will promise later He is still keen on punishing Cherubino He realizes that Cherubino heard what he was saying to Susanna This blackmail makes the Count have to forgive Cherubino but he sends the young man off for army duty

The Countess Bedroom 

The Countess is sad about her husbands infidelity She thinks she cannot be attractive any more as she is getting older Susanna comes to get the Countess ready for the day She has told her about what the Count has been saying to her Figaro then arrives and makes a plan to trick the Count His plan is that Susanna will give him a note which says she wants to meet him that night in the garden Cherubino will be waiting there dressed as a woman so that the Count thinks he is Susanna The Countess will arrive and catch him Figaro has already asked Basilio to give the Count a letter which says that the Countess also has her own secret meeting with someone

Susanna lets Cherubino into the room but locks the door because she is worried about what the Count will do if he find Cherubino there Susanna asks him to sing the song he wrote in honour of the Countess After the song they put him in womens clothes The Countess sees Cherubinos letter about joining the army and she notices that the Count was obviously in such a hurry that he forgot to seal it with his signet ring Susanna returns to her room for some clothes in which to dress Cherubino While the Countess and Cherubino are waiting for Susanna to return they suddenly hear the Count arriving so Cherubino hides in the cupboard The Count wants to be allowed into the room and the Countess unlocks the door The Count enters angry at the information in the note that he has received from Figaro hears a noise from the cupboard and tries to open it but it is locked The Countess pretends it is only Susanna trying on her wedding dress He does not see Susanna coming back into the bedroom with the clothes and hiding after she realises what is wrong Furious and suspicious the Count leaves with the Countess to find a way to get the door open As they leave he locks all the bedroom doors to stop the person in the cupboard from escaping Susanna comes out of hiding and frees Cherubino who escapes by jumping through the window into the garden Susanna then takes his place in the cupboard 

The Count and Countess return The Countess finally admits that Cherubino is hidden in the cupboard The Count draws his sword promising to kill Cherubino but when the door is opened they are both amazed to find Susanna there The Countess says that she has told the Count that Cherubino was in the cupboard only to test him Now shamed by his jealousy the Count begs for forgiveness When the Count asks her to explain about the letter accusing the Countess of infidelity Susanna and the Countess explain that the letter was written by Figaro and then delivered through Basilio Figaro then arrives and tries to start the wedding feast but the Count stops him and asks who wrote the unsigned note given to him by Basilio Figaro manages to avoid the question only to have Antonio the drunken gardener arrive complaining about a man jumping out of the window into his plants and ruining his flowerpots Antonio brings a letter which he says was dropped by the escaping man and Figaro says it was he who jumped out the window and pretends that he also hurt his foot However the letter is Cherubinos appointment to the army The Countess and Susanna recognize the letter and whisper the information to Figaro who gets out of this situation by saying Cherubino gave it to him because it still needed the Counts seal Marcellina Bartolo and Basilio now appear Marcellina demands that Figaro should honour his contract to marry her The Count is enjoying this interruption The wedding will take place later so that the Count can study the problem The scene ends in a septet and the Countess anxious and upset faints

The wedding hall 

The Count thinks about the situation Susanna enters and agrees to arrange to meet the Count later that because the Countess herself plans to meet the Count but disguised as Susanna As Susanna leaves the Count overhears her telling Figaro that he has already won the case Realizing that he is being tricked he is determined to force Figaro to marry Marcellina

Figaros trial follows and the judgment is that Figaro must marry Marcellina Figaro appeals to the Count but the Count will not change the decision When Figaro says that he himself is of noble birth and that he was stolen from his parents when he was a baby it then turns out that Figaro is the long lost illegitimate son of Bartolo and Marcellina Because a mother cannot marry her son Figaro is let off During the celebrations Susanna enters with a payment to free Figaro from his debt to Marcellina Seeing Figaro and Marcellina in celebration Susanna thinks that Figaro is happy about marrying Marcellina The situation is explained to Susanna and she joins the celebration Bartolo is very emotional and agrees to marry Marcellina that evening in a double wedding 

All leave and the Countess alone sings about the loss of her happiness Susanna enters and tells her the latest plan to trap the Count The Countess dictates a love letter for Susanna to give to the Count which suggests that he meet her that night under the pine trees The Count is told to return the pin which fastens the letter

A chorus of young country workers among them Cherubino disguised as a girl arrives to serenade the Countess The Count arrives with Antonio and discovering the page boy is furious Barbarina calms him down and reminds him of a promise he made to her Barbarina if you will love me I will give you anything you want What she wants it seems is to marry Cherubino Very embarrassed the Count allows Cherubino to stay 

The act closes with the double wedding during the course of which Susanna delivers her letter to the Count Figaro sees the note with the pin in it thinks it is from another of the Counts secret meetings and laughs to himself As the curtain drops the two newly married couples rejoice

Count has sent the pin back to Susanna giving it to Barbarina Unfortunately Barbarina has lost it Figaro and Marcellina see Barbarina and Figaro asks her what she is doing When he hears the pin is Susannas he is very jealous especially as he recognises the pin to be the one that fastened the letter to the Count Thinking that Susanna is secretly meeting the Count Figaro complains to his mother and swears to take revenge on the Count and Susanna Marcellina tells him to be careful but Figaro will not listen Figaro rushes off and Marcellina decides to tell Susanna of Figaros intentions

Figaro tells Bartolo and Basilio to come to help him when he gives the signal They go off and Figaro thinks about how women are broken wikt linkficklefickle Susanna and the Countess arrive dressed in each others clothes Marcellina is with them She has told Susanna of Figaros suspicions and plans After they discuss the plan Marcellina and the Countess leave and Susanna deliberately sings a love song to her beloved near to where Figaro is so that he can hear it Figaro is hiding behind a bush and thinking the song is for the Count becomes more and more jealous 

The Countess arrives in Susannas dress Unfortunately Cherubino has also arrived and thinking the Countess is Susanna tries to kiss the supposed Susanna but is stopped by the Count The Count is running after the supposed Susanna but he cannot get her They both run off when they notice Figaro nearby Then the real Susanna arrives in the Countess clothes Figaro starts to tell her of the Counts intentions but suddenly recognizes his bride He joins in the joke by being very polite to her as if she were the Countess Susanna not knowing that Figaro knows it is she becomes jealous she thinks Figaro is going to ask the Countess for his love and so she slaps him Figaro then tells them that he has recognized Susannas voice and they make peace 

Figaro pretends to declare his love for the supposed Countess as the Count appears The furious Count calls for his people and for weapons his servant is trying to make love to his wife Bartolo Basilio and Antonio arrive with torches as one by one the Count drags out Cherubino Barbarina Marcellina and the Countess from behind the pavilion He refuses to forgive Figaro and the supposed Countess the real Countess appears and shows who she is the Count realizes he has been trapped and he simply kneels and asks for forgiveness The Countess sweetly forgives her husband and all are happy They celebrate as the curtain falls

Troma Films under their 50th St Films banner produced a 1993 dub of the movie co produced by Jerry Beck It was released on VHS and DVD by Fox Video Tromas and Foxs rights to this version expired in 2004 The movie was re released by Disney on March 7 2006 It features a new dub cast This DVD release is the first version of the movie in the United States to include both Japanese and English language tracks as Fox did not have the rights to the Japanese audio track for their version

Two girls Satsuki and her younger sister named Mei move to a house in the country with their father to be closer to their hospitalized mother Mei discovers one day a giant creature named Totoro who lives in the forest by their house One day when the girls are waiting for their dad by the bus stop they both see Totoro and a cat bus Later Mei decides to run away to try to find her mother at the hospital and gets lost Satsuki looks for Totoro who gives her a ride on the cat bus and helps her find Mei As the movie ends the girls are seen delivering an ear of corn to their mom to help her get well

One of the most significant things to point out in My Neighbor Totoro is that the mother is absent from the home According to Takie Sugiyama Lebra the Japanese mother is characterized as having suffered hardships This is true in Totoro as Mei and Satsukis mother is hospitalized with an unnamed illness The mothers absence is significant because at home the husband depends upon the wife for domestic care The husband is helpless in housekeeping tasks such as doing the laundry cooking cleaning and child rearing In the absence of her mother it is then Satsukis job to take over household tasks with Nannys help This is illustrated several times throughout the movie

One such illustration is when Satsuki prepares breakfast and lunch for her father and Mei before she leaves for school This is a task that would normally fall to the mother Also the various cleaning and garden tasks that Satsuki and Mei often had the help of Nanny to complete would have also normally been the main responsibility of the mother to complete

Mei and Satsukis father demonstrates both typical and atypical characteristics of a traditional Japanese father According to Peter Tasker Japanese children are accustomed to never seeing their father on the weekdays and only for short periods at weekends A husbands proper field of endeavor is the company This is only somewhat accurate in Mei and Satsukis relationship with their father Although their father is often away working at the university or visiting their mother in the hospital he is by no means an absentee father He is seen working at a desk while Mei plays outside and spending time with his daughters before their bedtime Many scholarly critiques of Japanese culture would lead one to believe that this is not the norm

My Neighbor Totoro exhibits several important cultural points through the setting and passive details

The house into which the Kusakabe family moves is an accurate portrayal of a typical rural Japanese home The sliding doors that the father opens when they first move into the house are common architectural features These doors are meant to be opened during the day weather permitting and closed at night Another feature to point out about the house itself is the way the foundation is constructed Japanese houses do not have cellars but are built with a foundation of shallow concrete or a single row of cement blocks On top of this type of foundation is placed a row of heavy timbers This can be seen clearly when Mei crawls under the house in pursuit of one of the smaller totoros

As for Totoro he lives in a tree demarcated by a shimenawa The tree is called shinboku Shinto is the traditional religion of Japan and some consider many of Hayao Miyazakis moviesincluding Totoroto have Shintoist themes and interpret Totoro as a kami spirit of the Shinto religion But Miyazaki says this movie Totoro has nothing to do with that Shinto or any other religion 

The community in which Satsuki and her family have moved is a typical agricultural town The rice paddies are visible throughout the movie Rice cultivation is one of the most important industries in Japan as rice is a staple of the Japanese diet The home that Satsuki and Mei live in is more spacious than what would be available in a city Also the scene where Nanny Mei and Satsuki are washing vegetables shows the near self sufficiency of these farming communities 

The bath scene is also demonstrative of archetypal Japanese life The bathtub is more like a small swimming pool than a tub As seen in the movie several people bathe together at once It is considered rude to enter the tub without first washing as shown by Satsuki before she enters the tub with her father and Mei These bathtubs are heated usually by small well tended coal burners under the tub

Another cultural manifestation is the scene that shows the family sleeping Often the living room is converted into a bedroom where the whole family sleeps together on mats called futon This sleeping arrangement is space efficient and accommodates for smaller housing in a country where living space is severely limited Mei is sleeping between Satsuki and her father which is the usual arrangementwith the youngest in the middle

In one scene Satsuki is shown preparing the familys lunch in traditional bento style A bento is a compartmentalized lunch box usually with only one or two tiers Food is arranged to be aesthetically pleasing Bentos are extremely common as lunch boxes for children adults and even those who stay at home as Mei does when Satsuki goes to school

Other passive cultural references include

My Neighbor Totoro was released by Studio Ghibli as a double feature with Isao Takahatas Grave of the Fireflies in August 1988 There are two theories for this one was that Totoro would not be successful Another theory is that Grave of the Fireflies was believed to be too depressing for audiences by itself and thus needed a lighter animation to accompany it The late Yoshifumi Kondo provided character designs for both movies

In 1993 Fox released the first English language version of My Neighbor Totoro produced by John Daly and Derek Gibson with co producer Jerry Beck Fox and Tromas rights to the movie expired in 2004 Disneys English language version premiered on October 23 2005 it then appeared at the 2005 Hollywood Film Festival The Turner Classic Movies cable television network held the television premiere of Disneys new English dub on January 19 2006 as part of the networks salute to Hayao Miyazaki The Disney version was released on DVD on March 7 2006 

As is the case with Disneys other English dubs of Miyazaki movies the Disney version of Totoro features a star heavy cast including Dakota and Elle Fanning as Satsuki and Mei Timothy Daly as Mr Kusakabe Pat Carroll as Granny Lea Salonga as Mrs Kusakabe and Frank Welker as Totoro and Catbus The songs for the new dub retained the same translation as the previous dub but were sung by Sonya Isaacs

In music a serenade is a song or piece of music which is sung or played in someones honour The word comes from the Latin serenare meaning to make calm

In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a serenade was usually a song which is sung by a lover underneath the window of his sweetheart in a country such as Spain The lover may accompany himself on a guitar This kind of serenade is often seen in operas eg Mozarts Don Giovanni There is a verb to serenade eg the lover was serenading his sweetheart

In the Baroque period a serenade was a type of cantata performed outdoors in the evening with singers and instrumentas Composers who wrote this kind of serenade include Alessandro Stradella and Alessandro Scarlatti

In the Classical music period the serenade became a piece of music for a small orchestra or a group of several instruments They are similar to a symphony but lighter in character They are often the same as a divertimento Mozart wrote several serenades of this type eg his famous Eine kleine Nachtmusik Later composers such as Brahms also wrote orchestral serenades Other Romantic composers often wrote short instrumental works which they called serenades Also the word serenade is featured in the arctic monkeys song reckless serenade 

A divertimento is a piece of music which is lighthearted and easy to listen to It is often performed on social occasions eg as music to be played while people eat or as after dinner music

Freemasonry is an organization of people who believe in brotherhood and helping others Its members are known as Freemasons Freemasons also help one another in times of hardship Freemasonry can be found all over the world in various forms About 6 million people are Freemasonscn

The local groups in various countries are known as lodges At the State or National level are Grand Lodges These are independent of each other Regular Freemasonry is only for men but there are also co ed Masonic lodges that are not recognized as legitimate by the regular groups All of these lodges believe in brotherly love relief and truth They do work for charities such as running schools for orphaned children There is a Royal Masonic Hospital which is a home for old members and their families

The word mason means a man who works with stone He is also called a stonemason Freemasonry grew from the groups of stonemasons in the Middle Ages These men were building cathedrals and other big buildings They were called freemasons because they were free they were not servants who belonged to a rich lord like many workers were in those days They often changed jobs and moved about from one town to another In this way they were different from other craftsmen who often worked in one place and had guilds in one town The stonemasons tried to keep their skills secret so that only they knew how to do their job This is probably why the Freemasons have hand shakes and passwords that they swear to keep secret

About 1650 Masons guilds started to let people who were not masons into their guilds In 1717 the first Grand Lodge was formed It developed into the governing body of Freemasonry in England In 1813 it merged with a rival and is now called the United Grand Lodge of England

Freemasonry is controversial It has been opposed on two grounds the first religious is that the Roman Catholic Church opposes Freemasonry although Freemasonry itself does not block Catholics from joining and a great deal belong to Masonic lodges in South America The second is political In Great Britain the Labor Party has advocated laws restricting Masonrycn

Die Entfhrung aus dem Serail is an opera by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart It is an example of a Singspiel a type of German opera which had spoken dialogue as well as singing and was often about magical stories Mozarts opera The Magic Flute is also a Singspiel 

The German libretto is by Christoph Friedrich Bretzner and was changed a bit without Bretzners permission by Gottlieb Stephanie The story is about the hero Belmonte helped by his servant Pedrillo who tries to rescue his beloved Konstanze from the seraglio of the Pasha Selim

The opera was first performed by the Nationalsingspiel which was sponsored by the Austrian emperor Joseph II Mozart arrived in Vienna in 1781 and was looking for an opportunity to get a commission for an opera He showed one his operas to the manager of the Nationalsingspiel He was impressed and asked Mozart to write an opera for the company

The work is lighthearted and meant to be funny Some of the characters in the story are Turkish Turkish stories and music were very popular at that time in Europe and Mozart writes some Turkish music in this opera Some of the arias are very difficult to sing especially the long Martern aller Arten sung by Konstanze which is like a concerto movement She is accompanied in this aria by an orchestra and four solo instruments

The opera was a huge success and earned Mozart a good sum of money However he was not paid properly for later performances so it did not make him rich

When Joseph II heard it he said to Mozart that there were too many notes to which Mozart replied There are just as many notes as there should be

The singers perform with a Classical orchestra to which are added instruments needed for Turkish music bass drum cymbals triangle and piccolo The main orchestra has pairs of flutes oboes clarinets bassoons horns trumpets a set of two timpani and strings In the aria Sorrow has become my lot there is also a basset horn

Konstanze and her English servant Blondchen have been captured by pirates who sold them to the Turk Pasha Selim Belmonte goes to rescue her Osmin the Pashas servant comes to pluck figs in the garden and takes no notice of Belmonte who tries to get news about his servant Pedrillo Osmin is angry After he leaves Belmonte meets Pedrillo and they decide to rescue Konstanze 

Selim appears with Konstanze He wants her to love her but she doesnt Pedrillo suggests to the Pasha that he should employ Belmonte as builder but Osmin does not let him come into the palace

Osmin tries roughly to make love to Blondchen After a duet Osmin departs Konstanze greets Blondchen in distress and tells her that Selim wants her love and is threatening to use force 

When she has gone Pedrillo comes to Blondchen who is his sweetheart and tells her that Belmonte is near and plans are ready for a rescue attempt Blondchen is very happy Pedrillo invites Osmin to drink Osmin gets drunk and Belmonte gets him out of the way so that Belmonte again sees his beloved Konstanze 

Belmonte and Pedrillo come to the garden with ladders Belmonte manages to snatch Konstanze away but when Pedrillo is about to escape with Blondchen they are caught by Osmin and Belmonte and Konstanze are also brought back by the guard Belmonte asks the Pasha not to kill them He says that his father is a rich Spanish governor who will pay a lot of money so that they are freed Selim Pasha says to Belmonte that he is the son of his greatest enemy so he is delighted to have caught him However the Pasha then becomes kind and decides to forgive them and set them free Osmin is not happy about this He would have loved to see them executed

Linux distributions are made of the Linux kernel and a collection of applications The operating system will be made up of the Linux kernel and usually a set of libraries and utilities from the GNU project with graphics that come from the X Window System Distributions that are made to be small may not contain X but use small window systems like busybox uclibc or dietlibc There are more than three hundred Linux distributions Most of those are in still in development being improved and changed constantly

Before the first Linux distributions a Linux user needed to be a Unix expert knowing what libraries and executables that were needed to get the system to boot and run

Linux distributions started to form after the Linux kernel was starting to be used by people outside the original Linux programmers They were more interested in creating the operating system than making it user friendlyFactdateMay 2008

Early distributions included 

SLS was not well maintained so Patrick Volkerding created a distribution based on SLS which he called Slackware released July 16 1993 This is the oldest being developed

People who used computers wanted to use Linux distributions as replacements to Microsoft Windows operating systems on the PC Mac OS on the Apple Macintosh and proprietary versions of Unix

Distributions are normally split into packages Each package has a certain application or service Examples of packages include a collection of fonts or a web browser

The package is usually given as compiled code with installation and removal of packages done by a package management system Linux distributions usually contain much more software than Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X

Well known Linux distributions include 

There are tools available to help people make the decision easier

There are several people named Michael Collins

He was born in Sams Cross West Cork Michael Collins was the third son and youngest of eight children Most biographies state his date of birth as 16 October 1890 however his tombstone gives his date of birth as 12 October 1890 His father also named Michael was a member of the republican Fenian movement but had left and settled down to farming Michael was only six years old when his father died 

After leaving school aged 15 Collins took the British Civil Service examination in Cork in February 1906 In 1910 he moved to London where he became a messenger at a London firm of stock brokers Horne and Company While in London he lived with his elder sister and studied at Kings College LondonCitation neededdateSeptember 2010 He joined the London GAA and through this the Irish Republican Brotherhood a secret oath bound society dedicated to achieving Irish independence In 1915 he moved to the Guaranty Trust Company of New York where he remained until his return to Ireland the following year

Michael Collins first became known during the Easter Rising in 1916 A skilled organiser and very intelligent he was highly respected in the IRB When the Rising itself took place on Easter Monday 1916 he fought alongside Patrick Pearse and others in the General Post Office in Dublin 

Collins like many of the other participants was arrested almost executed He was imprisoned at Frongoch internment camp Collins became one of the leading figures in Sinn Fin after the Rising This was a small nationalist party which the British government and the Irish media wrongly blamed for the Rising By October 1917 Collins had become a member of the executive of Sinn Fin and director of organisation of the Irish Volunteers amon de Valera was president of both organisations

Collins was nominated in the 1918 general election to elect Irish MPs to the British House of Commons in London Collins won for Sinn Fin becoming MP for Cork South However unlike their rivals in the Irish Parliamentary Party Sinn Fin MPs had announced that they would not take their seats in Westminster but instead would set up an Irish Parliament in Dublin

That new parliament called Dil ireann met in the Mansion House Dublin in January 1919 although De Valera and leading Sinn Fin MPs had been arrested 

In de Valeras absence Cathal Brugha was elected Promh Aire He was replaced by de Valera when Collins helped him escape from Lincoln Prison in April 1919

The Irish War of Independence began on the same day that the First Dil met on 21 January 1919 An ambush party of IRA volunteers acting without orders and led by Sen Treacy attacked a group of Royal Irish Constabulary men They were escorting a shipment of gelignite to a quarry in Soloheadbeg County Tipperary Two policemen were shot dead during the fight This incident is considered to be the first action taken in the Irish War of Independence

In 1919 Collins had a number of roles In the summer he was elected president of the IRB Director of Intelligence of the Irish Republican Army He also became the Minister for Finance His ministry was able to organise a large bond issue in the form of a National Loan to fund the new Irish Republic Collins and Richard Mulcahy were the two main organisers for the Irish Republican Army in as far as it was possible to direct the actions of disorganised guerrilla units 

In 1920 the British offered a prize of 10000 for information leading to the capture or death of Collins His fame had so transcended the IRA movement that he was nicknamed The Big Fellow 

In July 1921 the British suddenly offered a truce Arrangements were made for a conference between the British government and the leaders of the as yet unrecognised Irish Republic 

In August 1921 Eamonn de Valera made the Dil upgrade his office from Prime Minister to President of the Irish Republic This made him on the same level as George V in the negotiations Eventually however he said that as the King would not attend then neither would he Instead with the reluctant agreement of his cabinet de Valera assembled a team of delegates to go in his place The team was headed by Vice President Arthur Griffith with Collins as Deputy

The negotiations resulted in the Anglo Irish Treaty which was signed on 6 December 1921 In it a new state was agreed upon called the Irish Free State The agreement made an all Ireland state possible The six county region in the northeast could opt out of the Free State if they wanted to If this happened an Irish Boundary Commission was to redraw the Irish border The Irish Free State was established in December 1922 and as expected Northern Ireland opted to remain part of the United Kingdom proper

Although it was not the republic he was fighting for Collins concluded that the Treaty offered Ireland the freedom to achieve freedom He knew that the treaty and in particular the issue of partition would not be popular in Ireland When he signed the treaty he said I have signed my own death warrant

Sinn Fin split over the treaty and the Dil debated the matter bitterly for ten days until it was approved by a vote of 64 to 57 The Supreme Council of the IRB which was informed in detail about the Treaty negotiations voted unanimously to accept the Treaty The only exception was the later COS of the IRA Liam Lynch 

As expected the Treaty was extremely controversial in Ireland 

First amon de Valera President of the Irish Republic until 9 January had been unhappy that Collins had signed any deal without his and his cabinets authorisation 

Second the contents of the Treaty were bitterly disputed De Valera and many other members of the republican movement did not want Ireland to be a dominion of the British Empire They did not like the symbolism of having to give a statement of faithfulness to the British king 

The dividing of Ireland between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland was not as controversial One of the main reasons for this was that Collins was secretly planning to launch a guerrilla war against the Northern State In the early months of 1922 he had sent IRA units to the border and arms and money to the northern units In MayJune 1922 he and IRA Chief of Staff Liam Lynch organised an attack of both pro and anti treaty IRA units along the new border This offensive was officially called off under British pressure on 3 June and Collins issued a statement that no troops from the 26 counties either those under official control pro treaty or those attached to the IRA Executive anti treaty should be permitted to invade the six county area 

The new Provisional Government was formed under Collins who became President of the Provisional Government of Southern Ireland He also remained Minister for Finance of Griffiths republican administration after de Valera stepped down 

In the months leading up to the outbreak of civil war in June 1922 Collins tried to heal the split in the nationalist movement and prevent civil war De Valera having opposed the Treaty in the Dil withdrew from the assembly with his supporters Collins secured a compromise the The CollinsDe Valera Pact whereby the two factions of Sinn Fin pro and anti Treaty would fight the soon to be Free States first election jointly and form a coalition government afterwards

To try and find a compromise Collins proposed that the Free State would have a republican constitution with no mention of the British king However the British did not sign the proposed republican constitution They argued they had signed the Treaty in good faith and its terms could not be changed so quickly

On 14 April 1922 a group of 200 anti Treaty IRA men occupied the Four Courts in Dublin in defiance of the Provisional government Collins who wanted to avoid civil war at all costs did not attack them until June 1922 when British pressure also forced his hand After a final attempt to persuade the men to leave Collins borrowed two 18 pounder artillery pieces from the British and bombarded the Four Courts until its garrison surrendered

This led to the Irish Civil War as fighting broke out in Dublin between the anti Treaty IRA and the provisional governments troops 

Under Collins supervision the Free State rapidly took control of the capital In July 1922 anti Treaty forces held the southern province of Munster and several other areas of the country De Valera and the other anti Treaty TDs supported the anti Treaty IRA 

By mid 1922 Collins no longer really worked as Chairman of the Provisional Government He became the Commander in Chief of the National Army a formal uniformed army that formed around the pro Treaty IRA 

Collins along with Richard Mulcahy and Eoin ODuffy decided on a series of seaborne landings into republican held areas They re took Munster and the west in JulyAugust 1922 As part of this offensive Collins travelled to his native Cork This was against the advice of his companions and despite suffering from stomach ache and depression Collins is said to have told his comrades that They wouldnt shoot me in my own county He recorded his plan for peace in his diary Republicans must accept the Peoples Verdict on the Treaty but could then go home without their arms We dont ask for any surrender of their principles We want to avoid any possible unnecessary destruction and loss of life But if Republicans did not accept his terms further blood is on their shoulders

On the road to Bandon at the village of Bal na mBlth Collins stopped to ask directions However the man whom they asked Dinny Long was also a member of the local Anti Treaty IRA An ambush was then prepared for the convoy when it made its journey back to Cork city They knew Collins would return by the same road as the two other roads from Bandon to Cork were destroyed by Republicans The ambush party commanded by Liam Deasy opened fire on Collins convoy

Collins was killed in the gun battle which lasted about 20 minutes from 800 pm to 820 pm He was the only fatality He had ordered his convoy to stop and return fire instead of choosing the safer option of driving on in his touring car or transferring to the safety of the accompanying armoured car as his companion Emmet Dalton had wished They do not know who fired the fatal shot

Collins men brought his body back to Cork where it was then shipped to Dublin because it was feared the body might be stolen in an ambush if it were transported by road His body lay in state for three days in Dublin City Hall where tens of thousands of mourners walked past his coffin to pay their respects His funeral mass took place at Dublins Pro Cathedral where a number of foreign and Irish dignitaries were in attendance Some 500000 people attended his funeral almost one fifth of the countrys population

Eamon de Valera is reported to have stated in 1966 I cant see my way to becoming Patron of the Michael Collins Foundation It is my considered opinion that in the fullness of time history will record the greatness of Collins and it will be recorded at my expense However there is some doubt that de Valera ever made this controversial statement

An annual commemoration ceremony takes place each year in August at the ambush site at Bal na mBlth Cork 

There is also a remembrance ceremony in Glasnevin at Collins graveside

A school is a place where people go to learn In a school one or more teachers or professors help pupils or students with learning Today most countries require that children go to school for a number of years so that they can learn some of what they need later in life such as reading writing and some basic math However children with mental issues that are too much for the school to handle are not required to attend This is called being expelled These children must be given other alternatives so they can still receive required schooling Colleges universities and high schools are different types of schools that allow people to learn skills for future jobs

Some people attend school longer than others This is because some jobs require more training than others At first one teacher is able to teach all subjects but later teachers are specialized and they only teach a few subjects

Common subjects taught include science arts such as music and humanities like geography and history and languages

There are special schools too That way a truck driver that wants to get a better job later can again go to a specialized people school

Some schools are for boys and some schools are for girls they only accept boys or girls but not both Schools were often attached to religious buildings That way a religion place also had a school Since there are only monks in a monastery this was often also true for the school which only accepted boys Going to a school also meant learning about religion

In many parts of the world schools also help children with other things

Pedagogy is the science about teaching There are different approaches to teaching Similarly certain schools use different approaches
