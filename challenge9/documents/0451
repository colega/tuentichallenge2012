Cardinal directions or cardinal points are the four main directions or points of the compass north east south and west These direction are also written in short form as N E S and W

North and south are directed towards the north and south poles of the Earth The Earths rotation defines east and west The sun rises in the morning in the east and sets in the evening in the west

If a needle is magnetised and allowed to move freely it will align itself with the Earths magnetic field which is almost in the same direction as north The direction of the needle in this situation is called magnetic north which differs from geographical north by a few degrees

Through history different cultures have given different values to each direction For example in old Asian culture each direction is given a color as follows

East Green or Blue

South Red

West White

North Black

A knight is a piece in the game of chess Each player starts the game with two knights It moves in an L pattern two squares in one direction then one square in another It is the only piece in chess to be able to jump over other pieces It is also the only piece that can be in position to attack a king queen bishop or rook without being broken wikt linkreciprocallyreciprocally attacked by that piece Because of this the knight plays forks well in a game of chess 

Knight is shortened to Kt or N when recording games In printed game scores it is represented by a figurine

The queen in chess is piece which stands next to the King at the start of the game It can move any number of unoccupied squares diagonally vertically and horizontally When recording games it is shortened to Q

The queen moves like a bishop and rook combined Although both players start with one queen each A player may promote a pawn to a piece usually a queen when the pawn is reaches the 8th rank

The IndoArabic game lasted for nearly a thousand years until the end of the 15th century In it the piece next to the Shah was the Firzn or Visier who was a counsellor This piece had a movement even more limited than the king it moved just one square at a time on the diagonal Not surprising then that when the move changed into its modern form the Italians called the new game schacci alla rabioso

The International Date Line also known as just the Date Line is an imaginary line on the surface of the Earth going from north to south in the Pacific Ocean The date becomes one day later as one travels across it in western direction and one day earlier as one travels across it in eastern direction

The reason for this effect is that the countries on the eastern side of the International Date Line have the time zone 10 12 hours more than Greenwich And the countries on western side of it have the time zone 9 12 hours less than Greenwich So when travelling across the line ones watch has to be adjusted 20 24 hours depending on the time zones 

For example New Zealand is twelve hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time while Hawaii is ten hours behind Greenwich Mean Time When travelling from New Zealand to Hawaii the clocks must be switched 22 hours backwards about one day

International Date Line follows the meridian of 180 longitude down the middle of the Pacific Ocean for some time So that it does not cross nations it passes around the far east of Russia and other archipelagos in the Pacific

In the north the date line turns to the east through the Bering Strait and then west past the Aleutian Islands in order to keep Alaska and Russia on opposite sides of the line This is to keep it in agreement with the date of the rest of those countries The date line passes equidistantly between the two Diomede IslandsLittle Diomede Island and Big Diomede Islandat a distance of 15 km from each island

The date line circumvents the territory of Kiribati by swinging far to the east almost reaching the 150 meridian

In the South Pacific the date line swings east such that Wallis and Futuna Fiji Tonga and New Zealands Kermadec Islands have the same date but Samoa is one day earlier

The International Date Line can cause confusion among airline travelers The most problematic situation usually occurs with short journeys from west to east To travel from Tonga to Samoa by air for example takes about two hours but involves crossing the International Date Line causing passengers to arrive the day before they left This often causes confusion in travel schedules like hotel bookings Some examples of time zone adjustments for real air trips are Alaska Siberia 21 hours New Zealand Cook Islands 22 hours and Samoa Tonga 24 hours

If someone travels around the globe in an airplane from east to west they should subtract one hour for every 15 of longitude crossed losing 24 hours for one circuit of the globe but 24 hours are added when crossing the International Date Line The International Date Line must therefore be observed in conjunction with Earths time zones the net adjustment to ones watch is zero If one crosses the date line at precisely midnight going westward one skips an entire day while going eastward one repeats the entire day

For two hours every day at UTC 10001159 there are actually three different days observed at the same time At UTC time Thursday 1015 for example it is Wednesday 2315 in Samoa which is eleven hours behind UTC and it is Friday 0015 in Kiritimati which is fourteen hours ahead of UTC For the first hour this phenomenon affects inhabited territories whereas during the second hour it only affects an uninhabited maritime time zone twelve hours behind UTC

Originally the date line ran along the 180 meridian This is a relatively good choice because most of the time there is no land there There are however some problems

Looking form the north one of the first places where the meridian runs over dry land is the Chukchi Peninsula which is part of Russia The whole peninsula has been declared part of the UTC12 This means that the whole of Russia and with it the whole of Asia is on the same side of the date line

There are many groups of islands in the Pacific Ocean These groups belong to states who do not want some islands on one side of the date line and the rest on the other They have therefore decided to move the date line so that all islands are in the same time zone Examples of this are the Aleutian Islands which lie on both sides of the 180 meridian They are part of Alaska and are therefore all in the UTC 10 timezone The date line has a bump to the west there

There are a few Islands east of the 180 which belong to New Zealand It was decided that they should have the same date than New Zealand so the date line runs east of the meridian there

Kiribati is a state consisting of many small islands spread over a hunge portion of the Pacific the meridian runs right through the state Because the state needed the same date over all its territory the date line was shifted east the biggest shift to occur in 1995 The easternmost island of Kiribati was renamed to Millennium Island because it was the first part of the world which saw the new millennium

The Philippines had very good trade relations with Mexico They therefore decided they wanted the same date date line to the west of the state When the trade with China grew this was inconvenient They changed after Monday 30 December 1844 came Wednesday 1 January 1845

Jews and Muslims do special things on a precise day of the week This works well if the traveller stays on the same side of the date line but there is a problem when travellers move across it For the traveller it might still be Friday but the place where he is might say that it is Saturday

In ancient history a division of labour was when some people in a city stopped growing crops and took other jobs This usually happened because of a surplus of food This means that there was more than enough food for everyone so some people did not have to grow crops anymore

Xenophon was a philosopher of the 4th century BC In his book Cryopedia he writes about the division of labour 

Just as the various trades are most highly developed in large cities in the same way food at the palace is prepared in a far superior manner In small towns the same man makes couches doors ploughs and tables and often he even builds houses and still he is thankful if only he can find enough work to support himself And it is impossible for a man of many trades to do all of them well In large cities however because many make demands on each trade one alone is enough to support a man and often less than one for instance one man makes shoes for men another for women there are places even where one man earns a living just by mending shoes another by cutting them out another just by sewing the uppers together while there is another who performs none of these operations but assembles the parts Of necessity he who pursues a very specialised task will do it best

As of 1999 Hahn has stated that she plays Bach more than any other composer and that she has played solo Bach pieces every day since she was eight The following is an excerpt from the liner notes to Hahns album Hilary Hahn Plays Bach

Bach is for me the touchstone that keeps my playing honest Keeping the intonation pure in double stops bringing out the various voices where the phrasing requires it crossing the strings so that there are not inadvertent accents presenting the structure in such a way that its clear to the listener without being pedantic  one cant fake things in Bach and if one gets all of them to work the music sings in the most wonderful way

In a segment on NPR entitled Musicians in Their Own Words Hahn speaks about the surreal experience of playing the Bach Chaconne alone on the concert stage In the same segment she also discusses her experiences emulating a lark while playing The Lark Ascending by Ralph Vaughan Williams The complete transcript can be found here Musicians in Their Own Words

The Liberty Bell is an important and famous symbol of American independence It used to be in the Pennsylvania State House The bell was ordered from the London firm of Lester and Pack in 1752 It had the letters Proclaim LIBERTY throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof This was a part of Leviticus 2510 It first cracked when it was first rung when it came to Philadelphia and was made again twice by John Pass and John Stow two workmen When it was first made the Liberty Bell was used to make lawmakers come to legislative meetings It was also used to call people to public meetings

Bells were rung when the Declaration of Independence was read on July 8 1776 While there is no record that the Liberty Bell was rung most historians believe it was rung with the other bells In the 1830s the bell was used as a symbol by abolitionist societies who called it the Liberty Bell The bell got its large well known crack in the early 19th century One story claims it was cracked while ringing after Chief Justice John Marshall died in 1835

The bell became widely famous after a short story in 1847 claimed that an old bell ringer rang it on July 4 1776 after hearing the Second Continental Congresss vote for independence Actually the bell could not have been rung on that Fourth of July because no announcement of the Declaration was made that day However many people believed this story Even some historians accepted it as a fact From the 1885 the City of Philadelphia which owned the bell allowed it to go to many different patriotic meetings Many people came to see the bell and it grew even more cracked Pieces were broken off by souvenir hunters The last such journey was in 1915 After that the city refused any more requests of that kind

Ever since the city began in 1682 Philadelphia had been using its city bell to make its people know about meetings or civil danger The first bell hung from a tree behind the Pennsylvania State House now known as Independence Hall In 1751 a bell tower was built in the Pennsylvania State House and the leaders there began looking for a bell which could be heard from far away Isaac Norris speaker of the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly ordered the colonys London agent Robert Charles to get a good Bell of about two thousands pound weight We hope and rely on thy care and assistance in this affair and that thou wilt procure and forward it by the first good oppo as our workmen inform us it will be much less trouble to hang the Bell before their Scaffolds are struck from the Building where we intend to place it which will not be done till the end of next Summer or beginning of the Fall Let the bell be cast by the best workmen examined carefully before it is Shipped with the following words well shaped around it vizt

By Order of the Assembly of the Povince sic of Pensylvania sic for the State house in the City of Philada 1752

and Underneath

Proclaim Liberty thro all the Land to all the Inhabitants thereof Levit XXV 10

So Charles paid Lester and Pack 150 13s 8d for the bell including the cost of taking it to Philadelphia and its insurance It arrived in Philadelphia in August 1752

A big reason why the bell became famous was because of a writer named George Lippard On January 2 1847 his story Fourth of July 1776 appeared in Saturday Review magazine The short story was about an old man on July 4 1776 It described how he was sitting sadly by the bell afraid that Congress would not be able to declare independence Suddenly a young boy comes to tell the old man to ring the bell The story was widely reprinted This made people think of the Liberty Bell and the Declaration of Independence as closely related

Naming very large numbers is relatively easy There are two main ways of naming a number scientific notation and naming by grouping For example the number 500 000 000 000 000 000 000 can be called 5 x 1020 in scientific notation since there are 20 zeros behind the 5 If the number is named by grouping it is five hundred quintillion or 500 trillion

When large numbers have many different decimals in them such as 642 500 000 000 naming them with scientific notation is about the same but with one difference Still counting the number of numbers after the first number you need to include the ones that are not zero in the formula but after a decimal point So 642 500 000 000 will be 6425 x 1011 When naming by grouping each group of three numbers is listed with the name of the group With the same number it would be said to be 642 billion 500 million or 642 milliard 500 million

The American way or Short form for naming large numbers is different from the European way or Long form of naming large numbers This is mainly because of American finance Short form numbering is based on thousands and Long form is based on millions Because of this in short form a billion is one thousand millions while in Long form it is one million millions The change in the United Kingdom to short form numbering happened in 1974 Today Short form is most commonly used in most English speaking countries

The Spanish Empire was one of the largest empires in history and one of the first global empires 

In the 15th and 16th centuries Spain was in the center of European global exploration and colonial expansion and the opening of trade routes across the oceans with trade across the Atlantic Ocean between Spain and the Americas and across the Pacific Ocean between Asia Pacific and Mexico via the Philippines Conquistadors destroyed the Aztec Inca and Maya civilizations and took a lot of land in North and South America For a time the Spanish Empire broken wikt linkdominatedominated the oceans with its experienced navy and ruled the European battlefield with its well trained infantry Spain enjoyed a cultural golden age in the 16th and 17th centuries 

The Spanish Empire generally means Spains overseas colonies in the Americas the Pacific and elsewhere But it is not clear what is exactly part of the Spanish Empire For instance traditionally territiories such as the Low Countries or Spanish Netherlands were included as they were part of the possessions of the King of Spain governed by Spanish officials and defended by Spanish troops But the British historian Henry Kamen writes that these territories were never part of a Spanish state and instead formed part of the wider Habsburg estate Therefore many historians use both Habsburg and Spanish when they speak of the empire of Charles V or Philip II Only from an Anglosaxon point of view can these observations be accurate since with all effect the Low Countries were part of Spain during that period

Portugal was occupied by Spanish forces and was ruled by the same monarch in personal union but Portugal remained a separate state The Portuguese empire continued to be ruled from Lisbon during this period Therefore there was a joint Spanish Portuguese rule for some time These jointly run empires have sometimes been called the Spanish Portuguese Empire but they were not parts of one state

The Beginnings of the Empire 

The marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile created a personal union of Aragon and Castile 

In 1492 Spain drove out the last Moorish king of Granada After their victory the Spanish monarchs allowed Christopher Columbus to try to reach India by sailing west Columbus instead discovered America That was the start of the Spanish colonization of the continent 

By the Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494 the globe was divided into two hemispheres between Spain and Portugal Therefore Spain had the right to start colonies in all of the New World from Alaska to Cape Horn as well as Asia The Castilian Empire was the result of a period of rapid colonial expansion into the New World as well as the Philippines and colonies in Africa Melilla was captured by Castile in 1497 and Oran in 1509

The Spanish language and the Roman Catholic Church were brought to the Americas and to the Spanish East Indies by the Spanish colonization which began in the 15th century Together with the Portuguese empire the Spanish empire laid the foundations of a globalised trade by opening up the great trans oceanic trade routes Modern International law has its roots in the Spanish colonial expansion and bad experience with imperialism as well

The Viceroyalty of New Spain was the name of the viceroy ruled territories of the Spanish Empire in North America and its peripheries in Asia from 1535 to 1821 New Spain was the name that the Spanish gave to the area that today is central and southern Mexico and since the capital city of the Viceroyalty was in Mexico City the name was also used for the viceroyalty

The Viceroyalty of New Spains territory included what is the Bay Islands Cayman Islands Central America Cuba Florida Hispaniola Jamaica Mariana Islands Mexico Philippines Puerto Rico nearly all of the southwest United States and claims as far north as British Columbia and Alaska but the northern boundary of New Spain was redefined by the Adams Ons Treaty of 1819 Until 1739 New Spain also included Venezuela

The territories were separated into provinces Provinces were lead by a governor who was responsible for the administration of the province and often also lead the provinces army and militias The provinces were grouped together under five high courts called Audiencias in Spanish at Santo Domingo Mexico City Guatemala Guadalajara and Manila Both the high courts and the governors had autonomy from the viceroy and carried out most duties on their own Only on important issues did the viceroy become involved in ruling the provinces directly

In 1821 Spain lost continental territories when it recognized the independence of Mexico as well as Santo Domingo when it was invaded by Haiti that same year However Cuba Puerto Rico and Spanish East Indies remained a part of the Spanish crown until the SpanishAmerican War

Ethane is a chemical compound and an alkane with a chemical formula of C2H6 It is the only type of alkane with two carbon atoms 

Its main use is in the chemical industry in producing ethylene by steam cracking At room temperature the gas is flammable and it explodes when mixed with air When ethane is at a liquid state touching it will result with a very serious frostbite

In chemistry terms cracking is a process by which complicated organic molecules are broken down into simpler molecules by breaking their carbon carbon bonds How fast the cracking process is and how long it takes for the end products to form are very dependent on the temperature and any existing catalysts Cracking also referred to as pyrolysis is the breakdown of a large alkane into smaller more useful alkanes and an alkene

Cracking is used in petroleum to form light products such as LPG and gasoline

It usually produces a short chain alkane and a long chain alkene

The Mourning Dove is a member of the dove family The bird is also called the Western Turtle Dove or American Mourning Dove or Rain Dove and used to be known as the Carolina Pigeon or Carolina Turtledove It is hunted often with up to 70 million birds shot in the United States both for sport and for meat Its mournful woo oo oo oo call gives the bird its name The bird is a strong flier and can fly up to the speed of 88 kmh

Mourning Doves are light grey and brown and both males and females look similar The species is generally monogamous Both parents incubate and care for their children Mourning Doves almost always feed on seeds alone but the young are fed crop milk by their parents

The Mourning Dove is closely related to the Eared Dove and the Socorro Dove Some describe them as forming a superspecies and these three birds are sometimes put in the separate genus Zenaidura In addition the Socorro Dove was once thought as in the same species as the Mourning Dove However differences in behavior call and appearance separate them as two different species

There are five subspecies of Mourning Dove

The West Indian subspecies is found throughout the Greater Antilles It has also been found recently in the Florida Keys The Eastern subspecies lives mainly in eastern North America as well as Bermuda and the Bahamas The Western subspecies is found in western North America and parts of Mexico The Panamanian subspecies is located in Central America The Clarion Island subspecies is found just off the Pacific coast of Mexico

The Mourning Dove is sometimes called the American Mourning Dove because it may be confused with the distantly related African Mourning Dove It also used to be known as the Carolina Turtledove or Carolina Pigeon The species scientific name was given in 1838 by French zoologist Charles L Bonaparte honoring his wife Princess Znaide The mourning part of its name comes from its call

The Mourning Dove has a large range of nearly 11 million square kilometers It can also be seen throughout the Greater Antilles most of Mexico the Continental United States and southern Canada In the summer the birds can be best seen at the Canadian prairies and in the winter at southern Central America The species is a vagrant in northern Canada Alaska and South America It has been seen at least seven times in the Western Palearctic with records from the British Isles the Azores and Iceland In 1963 the Mourning Dove was introduced to Hawaii and in 1998 there was still a small population in Hawaii North Kona It is also noted as far as Pakistan in the east

The Mourning Dove is a medium sized slender dove They weigh an average of 4 to 6 ounces It has a small head and a long tail Mourning Doves have perching feet with three toes forward and one behind The legs are short and have a reddish color The beak is small and dark usually a mixture of brown and black

Its feathers are generally light gray brown and lighter and more pink below The wings may have black spots and the outer tail feathers are white The eyes are dark with light skin around them The adult male has bright purple pink patches on the sides of its neck with light pink coloring up to the breast Younger birds look more scaly and dark

All five subspecies of the Mourning Dove look similar and cannot be told apart easily The Western subspecies has longer wings a longer beak shorter toes and is more lighter in color The Panama Mourning Dove has shorter wings and legs a longer beak and is grayer in color The Clarion Island subspecies has larger feet a larger beak and is darker brown in color

The Mourning Dove lives in a wide variety of habitats such as farms prairie grassland and woods It does not live in swamps or thick forests The species have also gotten used to living in places where humans are such as in cities or near farmsteads

This species call is a cooOOoo woo woo woooo which is used by males when attracting a mate Other sounds include a nest call by paired males to attract their mates to the nests a greeting call by males upon joining their mates again and an alarm call by either male or female when threatened In flight the wings make a fluttery whistling sound that is quiet and hard to hear but is louder at take off and landing

The male begins courtship by flying noisily and then in a graceful circular glide with its wings outstretched and head down After landing the male will go to the female with a puffed out breast bobbing head and loud calls Once the pair is mated they will often spend time preening each others feathers

The male then shows the female all the potential nest sites and lets the female choose one and build the nest The male will fly about gather material and bring it to her The male stands on the females back to give the material to the female who builds it into the nest The nest is constructed of twigs conifer needles or grass Sometimes mourning doves will take place of the unused nests of other Mourning doves birds or mammals such as squirrels

Most nests are in trees but they can also be found in shrubs vines or on buildings and hanging flower pots When there is no suitable place to nest above Mourning Doves will nest on the ground

The nest is almost always big enough for exactly two eggs Sometimes however a female will lay her eggs in the nest of another pair leading to three or four eggs in the nest The eggs are small and white Both sexes incubate the male from morning to afternoon and the female the rest of the day and at night Mourning Doves rarely leave their nest alone

Incubation takes two weeks Young Mourning Doves need care very strongly because they cannot hatch by themselves and are covered all over with down Both parents feed the squabs crop milk for the first 34 days of life After that they gradually begin to eat seeds The feathers and wing muscles begin to develop for flight in about 1115 days This happens before the squabs are fully grown but after they digest the adult food They stay nearby to be fed by their father for up to two weeks after fledging 

Mourning Doves breed quickly In warmer areas these birds may raise up to six broods in a season This fast breeding is essential because they cannot live long Each year the mortality can reach 58 a year for adults and 69 for the young

The Mourning Dove does not easily leave its mate Pairs may sometimes remain together throughout the winter However lone doves will find new partners if necessary

Mourning Doves eat almost only seeds which make up more than 99 of their diet Rarely they will eat snails or insects Mourning Doves generally eat enough to fill their stomach and then fly away to digest while resting They often swallow gravel or sand to help them digest At bird feeders Mourning Doves are attracted to corn millet and sunflower seeds Mourning Doves do not dig or scratch for seeds but only eat what they can see They will sometimes perch on plants and eat from them

Mourning Doves especially prefer pine nuts sesame and wheat When their favorite foods are absent Mourning Doves will eat the seeds of other plants including buckwheat and rye

Mourning Doves can be easily harmed with several different parasites and diseases including tapeworms nematodes mites and lice The Trichomonas gallinae a kind of parasite that lives in the mouth is especially severe While a Mourning Dove will sometimes be unharmed by it it will often starve to death because of a yellowish growth in the mouth

The greatest predators of this species are birds of prey such as falcons and hawks Other times during nesting corvids grackles house cats or rat snakes will prey on their eggs Cowbirds rarely parasitize Mourning Dove nests Mourning Doves reject slightly under a third of Cowbird eggs in such nests and the cowbirds cannot eat the Mourning Doves vegetarian diet

Like other columbids the Mourning Dove drinks without lifting or tilting its head It often gathers at drinking spots around dawn and dusk

Mourning doves wash themselves in the sun or rain by lying on the ground or on a flat tree limb leaning over stretching one wing and continuing this for up to twenty minutes These birds can also take baths in shallow pools or bird baths They may sometimes bathe themselves in the dust as well

When they are not breeding Mourning Doves roost in dense deciduous trees or in conifers During sleep the head rests between the shoulders close to the body and it does not tuck it under the shoulder feathers as most species do During the winter in Canada sometimes roosting is delayed on colder days

The number of individual Mourning Doves is estimated to be approximately 475 million The large population and its vast range explains why the Mourning Dove is considered to be of least concern which means that the species is not at immediate risk As a gamebird the Mourning Dove is shot up to 40 70 million times by hunters each year

The Eastern Mourning Dove is Wisconsins official symbol of peace The bird is also Michigans state bird of peace

The Mourning Dove appears as the Carolina Turtle Dove on plate 286 of Audubons The Birds of America

Mourning Doves are referred to often in American literature and they can also be found in some American and Canadian poetry such as in the work of Robert Bly Jared Carter Lorine Niedecker and Charles Wright

The Mourning Dove is thought to be the most closely related species to the Passenger Pigeon which was hunted to extinction in the early 1900s Because of this it might be possible to use Mourning Doves for cloning the Passenger Pigeon

The autonomic nervous system controls the bodys internal conditions 

Sometimes called the visceral nervous system or voluntary nervous system it is part of the peripheral nervous system

Most of its activities are done without conscious control or sensation but some work together with the conscious mind such as breathing 

The ANS has many effects including heart rate digestion respiration rate salivation perspiration diameter of the pupils the discharge of urine and erection

The ANS is divided into two sub sections

The Peripheral nervous system or PNS is part of the nervous system and consists of the nerves and neurons that are outside the central nervous system and serve the limbs and organs for example 

The PNS is not protected by bone like the central nervous system Therefore it is exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system But the enteric nervous system can be seen as a third branch of its own and not as part of the autonomic nervous system 

IKEA is a chain of furniture and DIY stores The store first opened in Sweden in 1943 and since then stores have been opened in more than 45 countries worldwide The owner of IKEA Ingvar Kamprad is the fourth wealthiest billionaire in the world

The central nervous system is the largest part of the nervous system It is made up of the brain and the spinal cord

Together with the peripheral nervous system it has an important role in the control of behaviour The CNS is protected by bone in the dorsal cavity the brain in the cranial subcavity and the spinal cord in the spinal cavity

The spinal cord is a thin bundle of nerves that is an extension of the central nervous system from the brain and is enclosed in and protected by the bony vertebral column The main function of the spinal cord is transmission of neural inputs between the periphery and the brain 

The human spinal cord is divided into 31 different segments with motor nerve roots going out in the ventral aspects and sensory nerve roots entering in the dorsal aspects The ventral and dorsal roots later join to form paired spinal nerves one on each side of the spinal cord 

There are 31 spinal cord nerve segments in a human spinal cord

Because the vertebral column grows longer than the spinal cord spinal cord segments become higher than the corresponding vertebra especially in the lower spinal cord segments in adults

Tengwar is a constructed writing system invented by J R R Tolkien The tengwar is used in his fictional world Middle earth for example the book The Lord of the Rings In the Quenya language tengwar means letters tengwa is the singular and means letter

The tengwar are used to write some of Tolkiens constructed languages like for example the elven languages Quenya and Sindarin But Tolkien used the tengwar mostly for writing English Because the tengwar is an alphabet it can be used to write almost any language like English or other languages

In the late 1910s J R R Tolkien developed the script Sarati which was already a bit similar to tengwar The tengwar were probably developed in the late 1920s or in the early 1930s The first published sample of tengwar writing was 1937 in The Hobbit to so called The Lonely Mountain Jar Inscription The full explanation of the tengwar was published in 1955 in Appendix E of The Lord of the Rings 

The tengwar have a certain order and are usually shown in a tablechart They are sorted by how they look which is also connected to how they sound Because it is an alphabet every tengwa means a sound The main tengwar letters are placed into four vertical series and six horizontal rows

There are different ways to write with tengwar which are called modes Between these modes there are differences sometimes only a few and sometimes many differences In different modes the tengwar sometimes mean different sounds In some modes the tengwar are used for vowels and consonants and in other modes the tengwar are only used for the consonants and the vowels are marked by signs above or below the tengwa These vowel signs are called tehtar There are different modes to write the different Middle earth languages People have also made new modes to write English and other modern languages with the tengwar

The tengwar is written in a tablechart with the way the letters sound For example if the sound comes from the front of the mouth it is in 1 row Each column is for the sounds that come from the nose throat or lips

Tolkien used the tengwar to write texts for his fictional world Middle earth and other things He used it to write in the languages he invented but also used the tengwar to write English 

After Tolkiens Middle earth books became famous people also got interest in his languages and writing scripts The tengwar are used by fans to write new things or to re write existing texts with tengwar

The Cuban Missile Crisis was a time of tension between the Soviet Union the United States and Cuba during the Cold War In Russia it is known as the Caribbean Crisis Cuba calls it the October Crisis It was a proxy conflict around Cuba It happened when the Soviet Union began building missile sites in Cuba in 1962 Together with the Berlin Blockade this crisis is seen as one of the most important confrontations of the Cold War It may have been the moment when the Cold War came closest to a nuclear war

There was a coup in Cuba in 1959 In it a small group of people led by Fidel Castro took power The new government of Cuba took over some American businesses The American government refused to buy anything from Cuba after that The US embargo against Cuba began February 7 1962 In 1962 the American government was worried that the USSR would attack America from Cuba because Cuba is near enough that the missiles could reach almost any city in America Cuba was then a Communist country like the Soviet Union

In October 1962 American ships blocked Soviet ships carrying missiles from going into Cuba The Soviets and Cubans agreed to take away the missiles if America promised not to attack Cuba America later removed some missiles from the country of Turkey near the Soviet Union However it is not decided if anyone won The USSR lost Chinas support over it

The Americans feared that the Soviet would expand communism or socialism The United States and the USSR had been political enemies after the end of the Second World War in 1945 The United States felt it was not right that a country in the Caribbean openly allied itself with the Soviet Union This would also make the Monroe Doctrine useless This doctrine kept powers in Europe from getting involved in South America 

In late 1961 President John F Kennedy launched a number of secret operations against Castros government These operations were named Operation Mongoose They were unsuccessful In February 1962 the United States launched an economic embargo against Cuba

In September 1961 the Cuban government thought the United States would invade They thought this because there was a resolution by the Congress of the United States This resolution allowed the use of military force if the interests of the United States in Cuba were threatened The United States also announced a military exercise in the Caribbean to be held the following month

Castro and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev agreed to secretly place strategic nuclear missiles in Cuba to be ready if the United States invaded Like Castro Khrushchev thought that a US would invade Cuba soon and that for Cuba to no longer be a Communist country would hurt his reputation around the world especially in Latin America He said that he wanted to confront the Americans with more than wordsthe logical answer was missiles

The tensions were at their height from October 8 1962 On October 14 United States reconnaissance saw the missile bases being built in Cuba The crisis ended two weeks later on October 28 1962 when the President of the United States John F Kennedy and the United Nations Secretary General U Thant reached an agreement with the Soviets to destroy the missiles in Cuba in exchange for a no invasion agreement Khrushchev requested that the Jupiter and Thor missiles in Turkey be removed and the United States did remove them

In Cuba Fidel Castro took power from General Batista on January 1 1959 From 1952 to 1959 Batista was a military dictator in Cuba very right wing with Mafia connections and the support of the Eisenhower administration The United States was interested in Cuba because of the many businesses that they had there even though the country was a dictatorship The countries were also military friends This was shown by the US base at Guantnamo Bay When Castro came to power in Cuba he nationalized American companies in Cuba meaning he took the private property from those companies and made it the property of Cuba to use as Castro decided The United States decided to break off economic relations with Cuba They stopped all aid going to Cuba and stopped buying Cuban sugar This was a disaster for Castro because America bought the most Cuban sugar However Russia saved the Cuban economy by buying Cuban sugar for a lot of money

Castro turned to the USSR still powerful at that time He signed a contract with Nikita Khrushchev the Russian president at the time The contract said that the USSR would buy 1 million tons of Cuban sugar once a year every year in exchange for Castros Communist support he declared himself a Marxist Leninist December 2 1961 

The reasons that Krushchev wanted to help Cuba were the following

The Eisenhower government was worried that Castro was a Communist and that this could be a threat to American economic broken wikt linkdominancedominance A timeline released by the National Security Archives shows that the US began planning to overthrow the government of Cuba in October 1959 After the nationalization of American property on the island Eisenhower broke diplomatic relations with the revolutionary government of Cuba on January 3 1961 and plans were made to remove the Castro government from power The Kennedy government took over those plans later On April 17 1961 the CIA began an operation later called the Bay of Pigs invasion by Brigade 2506 The goal was for a group of Cubans including some who were still loyal to General Batista to attack Cuba and overthrow Castro President Kennedy refused to order American troops to support the invasion

As the group set off to attack Cuba Kennedy grew nervous The president suffered from a rare endocrine disorder of chronic adrenal insufficiency called Addisons disease for which he received steroid and cortisone treatment Stress calls on the adrenal glands to function Symptoms of an adrenal disease include confusion and psychosis There was a lot of secrecy surrounding Kennedys health during his years as president and the 25th amendment to the US Constitution which clarifies what happens if the president is unable to do his job was introduced partly because of this incident Kennedy thought that an American attack against a Communist state could lead to a full scale war against the USSR Kennedy decided not to provide American military support at the last moment This may have led to the failure of the Bay of Pigs attack

Castro wanted to feel safe from the United States He knew that if a second attack was made Cuba might lose and he would be removed from power Castro asked Krushchev for missile sites to be built on Cuba so that he could defend himself against any American threat The USSR agreed to this and started building missile sites on Cuba These missiles could hit any major city in the United States

When Kennedy found out about the missile sites on October 16 by sending a United States Navy U 2 Spy Plane to take pictures of Cuba he saw the missile sites and thought the worst that Cuba was preparing to attack the United States

The United States was angry when they found out about the missile sites Kennedys advisers did not believe that the missiles were completely ready at the time they first saw the pictures but they guessed that the missiles would be ready in less than two weeks This meant that Kennedy had to act fast His options were not clear at first so he started EXCOMM so they would give him some options The options basically were

 Kennedy chose to build a blockade around Cuba to stop all ships going there The blockade was put in place on October 20

The USSRs first ships arrived at the blockade on October 25 and were turned away

Nikita Khrushchev sent a letter to Kennedy on October 26 Kennedys advisers said that the letter looked like it had been written by Krushchev himself and not his official writers who would normally do it They also said that it looked like it was written by a man who was under stress In a paper called Forty Years After 13 Days Robert McNamara quoted a part of the letter from Krushchev

Krushchev was saying that he would remove the missile sites if he promised not to invade Cuba An invasion of Cuba would make Krushchev look bad and could also lead to a nuclear war This was the reaction that Kennedy wanted

The very next day a second letter was sent from Russia to Kennedy This one looked more official than the first It also said that the US must take its nuclear missiles out of Turkey if they wanted Russia to take their missiles out of Cuba It would have been a fair trade because the US missiles in Turkey were close enough to Russia that they could reach most of the important cities and Cuba was close enough to the US that the Russian missiles would reach most of the important US cities The problem for Kennedy was that he could not publicly agree to remove the US missiles from Turkey because Turkey would then not be protected and they would not be happy Another problem was that Kennedy and his advisers did not know if Krushchev was still in power They thought that someone in the Russian government might have overthrown Krushchev They thought this because the second letter was so much different than the first Kennedy decided to send a secret message to Krushchev saying that they would remove the missiles from Turkey in a few months as long as they did not tell the public about it Kennedy then sent an official letter to Krushchev agreeing to the conditions of the first letter and ignoring the second

Krushchev agreed to the secret message

On November 1 the missile sites were removed and the problems were over

Nobody really knows who won the Cuban Missile Crisis Khrushchev said that he had won because the United States never bothered Cuba again and the missile sites in Turkey were removed But he had lost respect from China China broke off relations with the USSR and Khrushchev had to quit

Khrushchev goals in the crisis had various results

The United States saw Kennedy as the hero who had fought Communism and won

A gag is any thing used to stop a person from speaking This is done by blocking or muffling the persons mouth and making it difficult for them to move their jaw and tongue in a normal way

Gags are very commonly seen in BDSM and bondage fantasy Many different items can be used ranging from a hand simply clamped over the victims mouth to a scarf tied between the jaws to adhesive tape placed over the mouth and face to seal the lips There are also many kinds of specially made gags which usually strap around or behind the head Special gags of that kind are usually made from leather or rubber

In real life it is quite difficult to gag a person in such a way that their speech cannot be understood at all and it is almost impossible to prevent a gagged person from making some kind of sound It is also a risk to the persons safety as the more tightly and securely someone is gagged the greater the risk that they will choke or suffocate

The International Space Station is a space station being built in space The station is a joint project among several entities the United States Russia Europe Japan and Canada Other nations such as Brazil Italy and China also work with the ISS through cooperation with other countries

Building the ISS began in 1998 when a Russian and American module were connected with each other

In the early 1980s NASA planned Space Station Freedom as a counterpart to the Soviet Salyut and Mir space stations It never left the drawing board and with the end of the Soviet Union and the Cold War it was cancelled The end of the Space race prompted the US administration officials to start negotiations with international partners Europe Russia Japan and Canada in the early 1990s in order to build a truly international space station This project was first announced in 1993 and was called Space Station Alpha It was planned to combine the proposed space stations of all participating space agencies NASAs Space Station Freedom Russias Mir 2 and ESAs Columbus that was planned to be a stand alone spacelab

The first section the Zarya Functional Cargo Block was put in orbit in November 1998 on a Russian Proton rocket Two further pieces were added before the first crew Expedition 1 was sent Expedition 1 docked to the ISS on November 2 2000 and consisted of US astronaut William Shepherd and two Russian cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev The new section of the ISS has been named after the astronaut who started it all Maximum Ride This was announced at 513pm Tuesday 5th May 2009

Whens Bedtime

The scientists living in the space station have to get used to all kinds of changes from life on Earth It takes them only 90 minutes to orbit the earth so the sun looks as if its rising and setting every 45 minutes This can be pretty confusing especially when you are trying to decide when you should go to bed The astronauts try to keep a 24 hour schedule anyway

When it really is bedtime they have to sleep in sleeping bags that are stuck to the wall They have to broken wikt linkstrapstrap themselves inside so they will not float away in the middle of a nice dream

Zero Gravity

In space there is no gravity To help prepare astronauts experience zero gravity NASA trainers put the astronauts in the water Because water makes you float this is a little like experiencing no gravity However in water you can push against the water and move around In zero gravity theres nothing to push against so you just float in the air Another way of training is going in a plane and making the plane fall to earth very quickly This lets people experience zero gravity for a very short time This training can make people quite sick at first 

Since in zero gravity the astronauts do not use their legs very much they need to get lots of exercise to keep them from becoming too weak Lots of exercise is needed to keep the astronauts healthy every day

Eating in space style is pretty hard too Water and other liquids do not flow down in space so if you spilled some milk in a space station the milk would float around everywhere Liquids ruin electric equipment so astronauts have to be very careful in space They drink by sucking water out of a bag or from a tube stuck to the wall They can not put their food on plates because it would just float right off so they put it in pouches and eat from the pouches The food is usually dried because crumbs are very messy things that can ruin the equipment

Sometimes fresh fruits and vegetables are sent up to the astronauts but it is very expensive and hard to send it so they have to prepare a lot of food before they go

Using the Bathroom in Space Actually in space the bathroom should probably be called the restroom instead because you really can not take baths there Instead astronauts use squirt guns to take a shower One person squirts himself with a gun while other people stand outside with a water vacuum to get rid of all the water that floats out of the shower This is quite hard so astronauts usually just take a sponge bath with a wet cloth

Toilets can be another problem Toilets are supposed to use gravity to work When you flush the toilet gravity makes the water go down Since there is no gravity in space the toilet must be attached to the astronauts and gently broken wikt linksucksuck away all their waste

The Saalburg is a Roman fortification in the Taunus mountains in Germany and was a stronghold in the Upper Germanic Limes

It was constructed about 90 CE and enlarged until about 210 Then the Romans left it after 260 It is estimated that it was home to a cohors equitata about 500 cavalry and infantry to protect the access to the Rhine Main valley from the Germanic tribes in the North Eventually it decayed and its stones were used as a quarry

In 1897 Wilhelm II ordered that it was rebuilt Today the Saalburg houses a museum and is a center for Roman archeology It is located between Bad Homburg and Wehrheim some 30 km north of Frankfurt am Main

As part of the Upper Germanic Limes the Saalburg belongs to the UNESCO World Heritage sites since 15 July 2005

Naming very small numbers is the same as naming very big numbers but with one important difference There is a minus sign over what the 10 in the formula is raised to So if one wanted to write 0007 in shorthand form they would write it 7 x 103 since 7 is the third digit after the decimal point Naming a very small number with lots of different numbers inside it is the same as doing it with a very big number but again with that one difference of the minus sign So 00000452 would become 452 x 105

The Military of ancient Rome means all military forces of Ancient Rome from the founding of the city of Rome to the end of the Western Roman Empire Originally there was only the Roman army but a small navy was added during the Second Samnite War around 320BCE

The Roman military was an important part of the Roman state Josephus describes the Roman people as as if born ready armed It has a history of more than 1300 years Roman armies fought in Parthia as well as in Africa and in  what was in that time the far north  the British Isles

Following a series of reforms during centuries the army became highly trained and was well equipped in the middle of the Roman Imperial period The Romans also had a powerful navy that ruled the Mediterranean and the European Atlantic coast In the late Imperial period the militarys numbers were significantly increased to cover the borders and keep internal peace The circumstances of the Empire had changed the Western Roman Empire now relied heavily on foederati units of mostly Germanic tribes living within the borders who fought in the name of Rome during the Migration Period

The Roman Legion was the basic military unit of the ancient Roman army in the period of the late Roman Republic and the Roman Empire It was roughly equivalent to the modern word division In the plural the legions it may mean the entire Roman army 

A legion was about 5000 men in several cohorts of heavy infantry It was usually accompanied by attached units of auxiliaries who were not Roman citizens They provided cavalry ranged troops and skirmishers to complement the legions heavy infantry 

The size of a typical legion varied during the history of ancient Rome It had a complement of 4200 legionaries in the republican period of Rome In the imperial period the full complement was 5500 men split into 10 cohorts of 480 men each The first cohort was at double strength with 800 men The remaining 220 were 120 cavalry plus technical staff 

Legions were not standing armies until about 107 BC and were instead created used and disbanded again In the time of the early Roman Empire there were usually about 2535 standing legions plus their auxiliaries with more raised as needed

The development of the early legion may be seen as a Roman version of the Greek phalanx Until the 4th century BC the massive Greek phalanx was the mode of battle Roman soldiers would have thus looked much like Greek hoplites Tactics were no different from those of the early Greeks and battles were joined on a plain Spearmen would deploy themselves in tightly packed rows to form a shield wall with their spears pointing forwards 

There were now three lines of soldiers when in battle formation Roman soldiers had to purchase their own equipment 

In the middle of the Republic legions were composed of the following units

In a total of circa 3000 men the legion had only around 300 horsemen divided into 10 units of 30 men These men were commanded by decurions In addition to heavy cavalry there would be the light cavalry In battle they were used to disrupt and outflank enemy infantry formations and to fight off enemy cavalry In the latter type of engagement they would often dismount some or all of the horsemen to fight a stationary battle on foot an unusual tactic for the time but one that offered significant advantages in stability and agility in a time before stirrups

After 387 BC the preferred weapon was the gladius a short sword Their hobnailed sandals were also an effective weapon against a fallen enemy The heavy infantry was subdivided according to experience into three separate lines of troops

Each of these three lines was subdivided into maniples each consisting of two centuries of 60 men commanded by the senior of the two centurions Centuries were normally 60 soldiers each at this time in the hastati and principes The mid Republican legion had a nominal strength of about 4500 men 

Later on the legions were made up of 80 strong centuries Each century had its standard and was made up of ten units of eight soldiers who shared a tent millstone a mule and cooking pot

Throughout Romes Late Republic the legions played an important political role By the 1st century BC the threat of the legions under a demagogue was recognized Roman Governors were not allowed to leave their provinces with their legions When Julius Caesar broke this rule leaving his province of Gaul and crossing the Rubicon into Italy he precipitated a constitutional crisis This crisis and the civil wars which followed brought an end to the Republic and led to the foundation of the Empire under Augustus in 27 BC 

With each legion having 5120 legionaries plus an equal number of auxiliary troops the total force available to a legion commander during the Pax Romana probably ranged from 11000 downwards The more prestigious legions were stationed on hostile borders or in restive provinces tending to have more auxiliaries Some legions may have been reinforced with units making the force near 1500016000 or about the size of a modern division

The legion was commanded by a legate Aged about thirty he would usually be a senator on a three year appointment Immediately subordinate to the legate would be six elected military tribunes Five would be staff officers and the remaining one would be a noble heading for the Senate originally this tribune commanded the legion There would also be a group of officers for the medical staff the engineers record keepers the praefectus castrorum and other specialists such as priests and musicians

Despite a number of reforms the legionary system survived the fall of the Western Roman Empire and was continued in the Eastern Roman Empire until around 7th century The Eastern RomanByzantine armies continued to be influenced by the earlier Roman legions and were maintained with similar level of discipline strategic prowess and organization

Centurians were the glue which held a Roman legion together They were the full time professional officers of the Roman army The basic centurion commanded 83 men rather than 100 They rose in rank by commanding ever more important centuries 

The very best centurions were promoted to become centurions in the First Cohort called Primi Ordines commanding one of its ten centuries and also taking on a staff role The most senior centurion of the legion was the Primus Pilus who commanded the first century Only eight officers in a full legion outranked him They were

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 

The State of Israel is a country in southwestern Asia on the eastern side of the Mediterranean Sea Israel became an independent country in 1948 Israel is the only Jewish homeland and Jews all over the world think of Israel as their spiritual home Israels population was 75 million people in 2009 and 57 million are Jewish Almost all the other citizens of Israel are Arabs and include Muslims Christians Druze and Samaritans Jerusalem is Israels capital and largest city 

Israel is a small country but it has mountains deserts shores valleys and plains The climate is hot and dry in the summers and cool and rainy in the winters

Israel has few natural resources and imports more goods than it exports It has a relatively high standard of living and life expectancy Almost all of its people can read and write 

The countrys history goes back thousands of years to ancient times Two world religions Judaism and Christianity began here It is the place where the Jewish nation and religion first grew Jews and Christians call it the Holy Land because it is the place of many events described in the Bible 

Three thousand years ago the Canaanites and other Semitic peoples lived here Between about 1800 and 1500 BCE another Semitic people called the Hebrews settled in Canaan They were named the Children of Israel or Israelites The Israelites had 12 tribes They chose a king Saul as their leader The next king David began the Kingdom of Israel in about 1000 BCE and made the city of Jerusalem his capital His son Solomon built the first Temple for the worship of God Solomon died in about 928 BCE His kingdom broke into two countries The northern country kept the name Israel The southern country called Judah kept Jerusalem as its capital 

The Assyrians conquered the Kingdom of Israel in 732 BCE and the Babylonians conquered the Kingdom of Judah in 586 BCE Many Jews returned from Babylonia and built a country again First the Persians then the Greeks and then the Romans ruled the Land of Israel 

The Jews fought against the Romans but the Romans defeated them In 70 CE the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and the Jewish Temple there Again in 132 CE the Romans defeated the Jews and killed or took many of them to other places The number of Jews living in Israel became much smaller Many were forced to live in other countries This spreading of Jewish communities outside of Israel is called the Diaspora 

Many of the Jews who remained moved to the Galilee Jewish teachers wrote important Jewish books called the Mishnah and part of the Talmud there in the 2nd to 4th centuries CE 

The Romans began to call this region by the word that became Palestine in English The Roman and then the Byzantine empires ruled until 635 CE when Arabs conquered the region Different Arab rulers and for a while Crusaders ruled the land In 1516 the Ottoman Empire conquered the land and ruled the region until the 20th century

Since the Diaspora there have been many attempts to make a new homeland for the Jewish people In the 1880s this wish for a Jewish nation in Israel became a movement called Zionism Jews from all over the world began to come to the area and settled in desert zones then governed by the Turkish and later by the British Governments

On 14 May 1948 British control over the Palestine Mandate ended The Jewish inhabitants declared independence for the new Jewish state Immediately following Israels declaration of independence the armies of several nearby countries including Egypt Syria Jordan and Iraq attacked the new country

The countries of Lebanon and Syria are to the north of Israel Jordan is on the east and Egypt is to the southwest Israel also controls the West Bank of the Jordan River

Israel has a long coastline on the Mediterranean Sea In the south the town of Eilat is on the Gulf of Aqaba which is part of the Red Sea

The Galilee is a fertile and mountainous region in the north There is a flat plain called the Coastal Plain to the west near the coast of the Mediterranean Sea The Negev Desert is a barren area of flat plains mountains and craters in the south There is a range of mountains in the center that runs from the north to south 

On the eastern side there is a low area called a depression The Hula Valley and the Sea of Galilee are in this low area in the north The Jordan River runs from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea The land next to the Dead Sea is the lowest in the world It is 417 meters below sea level 

The weather is normally hot and dry in the summer and mild in the winter Rain falls mostly in the winter There is more rain in the north than in the south and hardly any rain in the desert Israel built a very big irrigation system to bring water from the north to the dry areas in the south so that crops can grow there also

Jerusalem is the biggest city in Israel Tel Aviv Haifa Beersheba and Rishon LeZion are also large cities The capital city is Jerusalem

Israel is a parliamentary democracy All Israeli citizens who are 18 years or older may vote The Israeli parliament is called the Knesset The Knesset has 120 members Each member is elected for no more than four years at a time The Knesset makes laws helps decide national policy and approves budgets and taxes

Voters do not vote for individual candidates in Knesset elections Instead they vote for a party This party makes a list with all its candidates The list may have only one candidate or as many as 120 candidates In an election the percentage of the vote that each list wins decides how many representatives or seats the party gets in the Knesset For example if a party list gets 33 percent of the vote it gets 40 Knesset seats 

Israel has no written constitution Instead the Knesset made Basic Laws The Basic Laws say how the government must work and give civil rights to the citizens

The Prime Minister is the head of Israels government He or she is usually the leader of the party that has the most seats in the Knesset The prime minister must keep the support of a majority of Knesset members to stay in office He or she appoints ministers to the cabinet The Knesset approves appointments to the Cabinet The ministers are responsible for subjects such as education defense social welfare and so on The prime minister is the head of the cabinet and decides the topics of cabinet meetings and makes the final decisions

Benjamin Netanyahu has been the Prime Minister since March 2009

The President is the head of state The Knesset elects the president for seven years Most of the presidents duties are ceremonial The president signs laws and treaties approved by the Knesset appoints judges and members of some public organizations He or she also accepts the documents from ambassadors and foreign diplomats bring when they are appointed

Shimon Peres has been the President since July 2007

Israel has many political parties with a large variety of opinions In the elections of 2009 twelve parties won seats in the Knesset 

The parties belong to three main main groups The biggest groups are the Zionist parties These include the conservatives such as the Likud party social democrats such as Kadima and the Labor party and the religious Zionists There are also smaller religious Orthodox Jewish parties special interest parties and Israeli Arab parties

A single party usually does not win enough seats in the Knesset by itself to have a majority so one of the bigger parties asks for support from the other parties including the religious parties to form a coalition government This gives these parties a lot of power although they are small

The Likud supports free market policies and limited government involvement in the economy Likud believes strongly in protecting Israels security It wants to give less away in the peace process for a negotiated agreement with the Palestinians and the Arab states 

The Labor Party supports government control of the economy but also believes in a limited amount of free enterprise The party says it will give more away for an agreement with the Palestinians and the Arab states 

Kadima is a centrist political party It believes in both Israels security and continuing the peace process and supports negotiating an agreement for peace with the Palestinians

At independence Israel was a poor country with little agricultural or industrial production But Israels economy has grown tremendously since 1948 The nation now enjoys a relatively high standard of living despite having few natural resources and a limited water supply 

Many immigrants came to Israel in the years immediately after independence Many of these immigrants were skilled laborers and professionals who greatly aided the nations economic development 

Many of Israels service industry workers are employed by the government or by businesses owned by the government Government workers provide many of the services that are needed by Israels large immigrant population such as housing education and vocational training 

Tourism is one of the countrys important sources of income Tourists visit many archaeological historical and religious sites museums nature reserves and beach resorts in Israel

Tourists support many of Israels service industries especially trade restaurants and hotels Over 27 million foreign tourists visited Israel in 2009

Israeli factories produce such goods as chemical products electronic equipment fertilizer paper plastics processed foods scientific and optical instruments and textiles and clothing The cutting of imported diamonds is a major industry Government owned plants manufacture equipment used by Israels large armed forces Tel Aviv and Haifa are Israels major manufacturing centers 

Agriculture formerly employed a much larger percentage of Israels work force But much of the work once performed by people is now performed by machines Important agricultural products include citrus and other fruits eggs grain poultry and vegetables 

The government develops helps finance and controls agricultural activity including fishing and forestry Israel produces most of the food it needs to feed its people except for grain Agricultural exports provide enough income to pay for any necessary food imports Most Israeli farmers use modern agricultural methods Water drawn from the Sea of Galilee irrigates large amounts of land in Israel 

Most Israeli farms are organized as moshavim or kibbutzim Israel also has some private farms 

The Dead Sea the worlds saltiest body of water is Israels leading source of minerals Bromine magnesium potash and table salt are extracted from the sea Potash used mainly in fertilizers is the most important mineral  In the Negev Desert there are mines for phosphates copper clay and gypsum 

Israel has few energy sources It has no coal deposits or hydroelectric power resources and only small amounts of crude oil and natural gas As a result Israel depends on imported crude oil for gasoline and diesel for transportation and coal producing electricity for its energy needs

Solar energy energy from the sun is used widely to heat water for houses Israel is developing other ways to use solar energy to power houses and factories

In 2008 Israel began investing in building electric cars and the stations to charge them There may also be large natural gas fields in the Mediterranean Sea that Israel could develop

For 2006 Israeli exports grew by 11 to just over 29 billion the hi tech sector accounted for 14 billion a 20 increase from the previous year

Because it has few natural resources Israel imports more goods than it exports The countrys main imports include chemicals computer equipment grain iron and steel military equipment petroleum products rough diamonds and textiles  Israels main exports are chemical products citrus fruits clothing electronic equipment fertilizers polished diamonds military equipmentand processed foods The nations main trading partners include the Benelux countries Germany Italy Switzerland the United Kingdom and the United States

Transportation Israel has a well developed transportation system Most middle class Israeli families either own a car or have one provided by their employer  Paved roads reach almost all parts of the country Public transportation both in and between cities is provided primarily by bus 

Ben Gurion Airport is Israels main international airport It is near Tel Aviv There are smaller airports are located at Atarot near Jerusalem and at Eilat El Al Israels international airline flies regularly to the United States Canada Europe and parts of Africa and Asia Israel has three major deepwater ports Haifa Ashdod and Eilat 

Israels communication system is one of the best in the Middle East Israel has about 30 daily newspapers about half of which are in Hebrew The rest are in Arabic Yiddish or one of several foreign languages The Israel Broadcasting Authority a public corporation set up by the government runs the TV and nonmilitary radio stations

Lake Champlain is a natural freshwater lake in North America along the borders of New York and Vermont and partially across the United States Canada border in the province of Quebec The lake was named for the French explorer Samuel de Champlain who discovered it in 1609

Lake Champlain is one of a large number of large lakes spread in an arc from Labrador through the northern United States and into the Northwest Territories of Canada Although it is much smaller than the Great Lakes of Ontario Erie Huron Superior or Michigan Lake Champlain is a large body of fresh water Approximately 1269 km in area the lake is about 201 km long and 23 km across at its widest point The maximum depth is about 400 feet It contains about 80 islands including an the entire country of Grand Isle County in Vermont

In the colonial times Lake Champlain gave an easily blocked water passage between the Saint Lawrence and the Hudson Valleys Boats and sledges were usually preferable to the unpaved and frequently mud bound roads of the time The northern tip of the lake at Saint Jean sur Richelieu Quebec is a short distance from Montreal The southern tip at Whitehall is a short distance from Saratoga Glens Falls and Albany New York

Forts at Ticonderoga and Crown Point controlled passage of the lake in colonial times Important battles were fought at Ticonderoga in 1758 and 1777 A important naval battle was fought in 1776 at Valcour Island in the Battle of Valcour Island Benedict Arnold delayed British ships enough to prevent the fall of these forts until the following year allowing the Continental Army to grow stronger and allowing the later victory at Saratoga

Agathis amber comes from the conifer Agathis which was formerly of very wide distribution

Amber from America and Africa often comes from the Hymenaea a genus of flowering plants

The resin can contain in addition to the beautifully preserved plant structures remains of insects spiders annelids frogs crustaceans and other small organisms which became enveloped while it was fluid In most cases the organic structure has disappeared leaving only a cavity with perhaps a trace of chitin

It is the amount of pressure that a column of mercury that is one inch tall has at 32 F at the standard acceleration of gravity or how fast things speed up as they are falling because of gravity

Airplanes that are flying at high altitudes or that are flying higher than what is called the Transition Altitude which varies by country set their barometric altimeters which control the air pressure in their plane to a standard pressure of 2992 inHg or 10132 hPa no matter what the actual sea level pressure is in inches of mercury used in the US and Canada and in other units in other countries The resulting altimeter readings or the things that show up on the planes altimeter are known as flight levels

In statistics and probability theory correlation means how closely related two sets of data are

Correlation does not always mean that one causes the other It is very possible that there is a third factor involved

Correlation usually has one of two directions These are positive or negative If it is positive then the two sets go up together If it is negative then one goes up while the other goes down

Lots of different measurements of correlation are used for different situations For example on a scatter graph people draw a line of best fit to show the direction of the correlation 

Strong and weak are words used to describe correlation If there is strong correlation then the points are all close together If there is weak correlation then the points are all spread apart There are ways of making numbers show how strong the correlation is These measurements are called correlation coefficients The best known is the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient You put in data into a formula and it gives you a number If the number is 1 or 1 then there is strong correlation If the answer is 0 then there is no correlation Another kind of correlation coefficient is Spearmans rank correlation coefficient

Correlation does not always mean that one thing causes the another thing because a something else might have caused both For example on hot days people buy ice cream and people also go to the beach where some are eaten by sharks There is a correlation between ice cream sales and shark attacks But just because ice cream sales go up does not cause more shark attacks

Because correlation does not imply causation scientists economists etc will test out theories by creating isolated environments where only one factor is changed However economists scientists and especially politicians and salesmen will sometimes say that correlation implies causation for personal gain or out of stupidity

Sunscreen is a lotion spray or other topical product that helps protect the skin from the suns ultraviolet radiation and which reduces sunburn and other skin damage with the goal lowering your risk of skin cancer However in the United States the term suntan lotion usually means the opposite of sunscreen and instead refers to lotion designed to moisturize and maximize UV exposure and tanning rather than block it These are commonly called indoor tanning lotions when designed for use with tanning beds or just suntan lotion if designed for outdoor use and may or may not have SPF protection in them 

The most effective sunscreens protect against both UVB which can cause sunburn and UVA which damages the skin with more long term effects such as premature skin aging Most sunscreens work by containing either an organic chemical compound that absorbs ultraviolet light or an opaque material that reflects light or a combination of both Typically absorptive materials are referred to as chemical blocks whereas opaque materials are mineral or physical blocks

Another result of the council was an agreement on the date of the Christian Passover the most important feast of the ecclesiastical calendar The council decided in favour of celebrating the resurrection on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox independently of the Bibles Hebrew Calendar and authorized the Bishop of Alexandria to announce annually the exact date to his fellow bishops

The Council of Nicaea was historically significant because it was the first effort to come to a consensus in the church through an assembly representing all of Christendom It was the first occasion for the development of technical Christology Further Constantine in convoking and presiding over the council signaled a measure of imperial control over the church With the creation of the Nicene Creed a precedent was established for subsequent general councils to create a statement of belief and canons which were intended to become guidelines for doctrinal orthodoxy and a source of unity for the whole of Christendom a momentous event in the history of the Church and subsequent history of Europe

The First Council of Nicaea was called by Constantine I upon the recommendations of a synod led by Hosius of Cordoba in the Eastertide of 325 To most bishops the teachings of Arius were heretical and a danger to the salvation of souls In the summer of 325 the bishops of all provinces came to Nicaea a place easily accessible to the majority of them particularly those of Asia Minor Syria Palestine Egypt Greece and Thrace

Approximately 300 bishops attended from every region of the Empire except Britain This was the first general council in the history of the Church since the Apostolic Council of Jerusalem In the Council of Nicaea the Church had taken her first great step to define doctrine more precisely in response to a challenge from a heretical theology The resolutions in the council being ecumenical were intended for the whole Church

Constantine had invited all 1800 bishops of the Christian church but only 250 to 320 bishops actually participated Eusebius of Caesarea counted 250 Athanasius of Alexandria counted 318 and Eustathius of Antioch counted 270 Later Socrates Scholasticus recorded more than 300 and Evagrius Hilarius Jerome and Rufinus recorded 318

The bishops were given free travel to the council as well as lodging These bishops did not travel alone each one had permission to bring with him two priests and three deacons so the total number of attendees would have been above 1500 Eusebius speaks of an almost innumerable host of accompanying priests deacons and acolytes 

A special prominence was also attached to this council because the persecution of Christians had just ended with the February 313 Edict of Milan by Emperors Constantine and Licinius 

The Eastern bishops formed the great majority Of these the first rank was held by the three patriarchs Alexander of Alexandria Eustathius of Antioch and Macarius of Jerusalem The Latin speaking provinces sent at least five representatives Marcus of Calabria from Italia Cecilian of Carthage from Africa Hosius of Crdoba from Hispania Nicasius of Dijon from Gaul and Domnus of Stridon from the province of the Danube Pope Silvester I did not attend telling he was ill but he was represented by two priests

Athanasius of Alexandria a young deacon and companion of Bishop Alexander of Alexandria was among the assistants Athanasius eventually spent most of his life battling against Arianism Alexander of Constantinople then a presbyter was also present as representative of his aged bishop

Lupin often spelled lupine in North America is the common name for members of the genus Lupinus in the family Fabaceae 

The genus includes between 150 200 species and has a wide distribution in the Mediterranean region  Subgen Lupinus and the Americas  Subgen Platycarpos Kurl

The species are mostly herbaceous perennial plants 03 15 m tall but some are annual plants and a few are shrubs up to 3 m tall with one Lupinus jaimehintoniana a tree 8 m high with a trunk 20 cm in diameter from the Mexican state of Oaxaca They have a characteristic and easily recognised leaf shape with soft green to grey green or silvery leaves with the blades usually palmately divided into 517 leaflets or reduced to a single leaflet in a few species of the southeastern United States in many species the leaves are hairy with silvery hairs often densely so The flowers are produced in dense or open whorls on an erect spike each flower 1 2 cm long with a typical peaflower shape with an upper standard two lateral wings and two lower petals fused as a keel The fruit is a pod containing several seeds

In New Zealand lupins have escaped into the wild and grow in large numbers along main roads and streams in South Island The seeds are carried by car tires and water flow and unfortunately some tourist shops in the major tourist areas have been reported to have sold packets of lupin seeds to tourists with the instructions to plant water and watch them grow into a giant beanstalk They are principally blue pink and violet with some yellow and are very attractive providing colourful vistas with a backdrop of mountains and lakes The New Zealand environment authorities have a campaign to reduce their numbers although this seems a hopeless task especially when faced with such ignorance as mentioned above In fields they seem to be eradicated by sheep and hence remain largely restricted to ungrazed roadside verges and stream banks

The bar decibar and the millibar are units of pressure They are not SI units but they are anyhow also used with for use with the SI The bar is still used in descriptions of pressure because it is about the same as atmospheric pressure

The bar decibar and millibar are known as

The word bar has its origin in the Greek word meaning weight Its official symbol is bar the earlier b is now no longer used but still often seen especially as mb rather than the correct mbar for millibars

The bar and millibar were defined by Sir Napier Shaw in 1909 and internationally used in 1929

The pascal is the SI derived unit of pressure or stress It is a measure of perpendicular force per unit area ie equal to one newton per square meter In everyday life the pascal is maybe best known from meteorological air pressure reports where it happens in the form of hectopascal In other cases the kilopascal is more commonly used for example on bicycle tire labels One hectopascal corresponds to 01 and one kilopascal to about 1 of atmospheric pressure

It is named after the French mathematician and physicist Blaise Pascal

Don Giovanni is an opera by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart It is one of the best known of all operas and is often performed in opera houses all over the world

Don Giovanni can be described as a mixture between the traditions of opera seria and opera buffa Mozart was the first great composer to make his own living and composing the way he wanted instead of being employed either by a rich nobleman or by the church In this opera which is written in Italian he shows a nobleman who lives an evil life and has to suffer for it in the end

Mozart lived in Vienna when he was grown up Although he was a very great composer people in Vienna did not always like his music Sometimes this was because other composers were jealous and tried to make Mozart look bad Audiences had their favourite composers and went to support them Mozart had written an opera called Le Nozze di Figaro which was performed in Vienna in 1786 The performance was not very successful In January 1787 he went to Prague for the first time and performed Le Nozze di Figaro there The Prague audience were very enthusiastic From then on Mozart was always very welcome in Prague He visited Prague five times during the last five years of his life He was asked to write another opera for Prague so he wrote the opera Don Giovanni It was given its first public performance in the Estates Theatre in Prague on 29 October 1787 The opera house was very full There was not enough room for everybody who wanted to come It was a great success Everybody cheered and clapped They realized how beautiful the music was When he performed it later in Vienna it was not nearly so successful It was many years before it became really popular in Vienna

When Mozart and his wife arrived in Prague about a month before the performance he had not yet finished writing the opera He finished writing it in Prague either in the inn where he was staying or in Bertramka the house of his friend Duschek which was just outside the city The night before the first performance he still had not written the overture The performers were really worried that Mozart would not finish it in time for the performance Mozart sat up all night composing the overture The orchestral parts then had to be written out by copyists for the various instruments of the orchestra The music was ready just before the opera was due to start The music for the overture was handed out among the orchestra who had to sightread it

Mozart knew the singers who sang the main parts and he wrote the music very carefully so that it would suit their voices He spent a lot of time rehearsing them and the orchestra during the weeks before the production and he conducted the performance himself

The libretto were written by Lorenzo da Ponte based on a well known story Other composers have written operas based on the same story

The story is to take place in a town in Spain Don Giovanni is a nobleman who has had lots of lovers He promises he will marry them and then he goes off and leaves them He has a servant called Leporello 

Don Giovanni is in love with Donna Anna whose father the Commendatore is an important gentleman In the Commendatores garden Leporello is standing guard while Don Giovanni is making love to Donna Anna Leporello sings an aria in which he complains about his job Suddenly Donna Anna appears chasing Giovanni who is wearing a mask so that she does not know who she is The Commendatore appears He fights Giovanni with a sword and the Commendatore is killed Donna Annas fianc Don Ottavio promises Donna Anna that he will find the man who killed her father 

In a square outside the palace of Don Giovanni another lady Donna Elvira is complaining about how her lover had promised her marriage and then left her Giovanni and Leporello arrive and hear her Giovanni realizes who she is and disappears leaving Leporello to talk to the lady In a very amusing aria Leporello tells her all about the long list of lovers that Don Giovanni has had

When she has left a wedding procession enters Giovanni immediately likes the bride who is called Zerlina He tries to get her future husband Masetto to go by saying that he will host a wedding celebration at his castle Masetto is angry when he realizes that Giovanni wants to stay behind with Zerlina but he finds it difficult to refuse because Don Giovanni is a nobleman and he is only a simple peasant so he ought to obey him Giovanni then flirts with Zerlina Elvira arrives and warns Zerlina about how bad Giovanni is Ottavio and Anna appear They do not know that Giovanni is the man they are looking for who murdered the Commendatore They ask him to help them look for the murderer Elvira comes and accuses Giovanni of having left her Giovanni explains to the others that she is mad Anna suddenly realizes Giovanni was the man who tried to force her to love her Ottavio is not quite sure

Don Giovanni tells Leporello to organize a party quickly

Zerlina tries to tell Masetto she is innocent Masetto tries to see whether she means it He watches what happens when Giovanni comes There is a lot of confusion and Giovanni gives Zerlina back to Masetto Everyone goes to the wedding festivities Elvira Ottavio and Anna are masked so that people do not recognize them They are trying to catch Giovanni and prove that he is bad Giovanni tries to make love to Zerlina who shouts for help When people rush to the scene he tries to say that Leporello did it but they do not believe him Giovanni escapes

Leporello threatens to leave Giovanni but Giovanni calmly offers to pay him more money Giovanni wants to make love to Elviras maid and so he changes clothes with Leporello Elvira comes onto her balcony Leporello sings that he is sorry about what he has done and wants her to return to him Elvira comes down to the street They go off together while Giovanni sings a love song to the maid He accompanies himself on the mandolin 

Masetto and his friends arrive looking for Giovanni Giovanni pretends that he too wants Giovanni dead and joins the hunt After getting the crowd to separate Giovanni beats up Masetto and runs away laughing Zerlina arrives and comforts Masetto

In a dark courtyard Leporello leaves Elvira As he tries to escape Anna and Ottavio arrive Zerlina and Masetto open the door and catch Leporello They all stand round him Elvira who thinks he is Giovanni asks for him to be forgiven and says he is her husband Leporello throws off Giovannis cloak and hat so that everyone realizes who he is He manages to escape 

In a graveyard there is now a statue of the Commendatore Leporello tells Don Giovanni how he was nearly killed Giovanni just teases him Leporello is not amused and Don Giovanni just laughs Suddenly the statue speaks The statue tells Giovanni that he will soon stop laughing Leporello is terrified but Giovanni just laughs and invites the statue to dinner

In Donna Annas room Ottavio asks Anna to marry him but Anna wants to wait because it is so soon after her fathers death She says she loves Ottavio and that she will be faithful to him

Don Giovanni is having supper in his room Musicians are playing Elvira appears once more trying to persuade him to change his ways but Giovanni ignores her and sings about wine and women Elvira goes Suddenly the statue appears The statue sings Don Giovanni You invited me to dinner and I have come Giovanni refuses to be sorry for the way he has lived so the statue drags Giovanni down to his death in hell

In the final scene everyone is happy Leporello comes out from under the table where he has been hiding in fear Anna and Ottavio promise to marry after a year Elvira will spend the rest of her life in a convent Zerlina and Masetto will finally go home for dinner and Leporello will find a new master The last chorus tells the moral of the opera  That is the way in which an evil person dies The death of a sinner always reflects their life

In the next scene we see Princess Pamina who is being guarded by a cruel Moor called Monostatos He has tied the princess up Papageno arrives and both men are frightened of one another Monostatos runs away Papageno unties the rope around the princess and tells her about the prince who is on his way to rescue her

In the next scene Tamino finds himself in a holy place The three boys have guided him there They tell him he must be patient and silent He meets a priest who tells him he must not think that Sarastro is cruel He tells him that Pamina is alive Tamino is very happy to hear this takes his flute and plays The animals from the forest come round him Pamina and Papagena are caught by Monostatos He is about to tie them up but Papageno plays his magic bells and when they hear the music Monostatos and all the animals cannot help dancing and they disappear still dancing Sarastro enters He tells Pamina once more that she must stay with him to learn how to live a good virtuous life She must not become evil like her mother Monostatos enters with Tamino whom he has caught Tamino and Pamina see one another and embrace Sarastro says that Monostatos must have a beating He says that Tamino and Pamina cannot have one another yet First they will have to go to the temple and go through some trials to show that they are good

Sarastro explains to the priests that Tamino and Pamina will have to go through the trials to show that they are worthy of one another If they can do this then they will be able to defeat the evil power of the Queen of the Night

Tamino and Papageno go through the trials together Tamino remains calm and brave Papageno is frightened and finds it difficult to keep quiet but he continues because he has been promised that a girl called Papagena will be waiting for him

In the first trial the Three Ladies try to make them think that the dark place they are in will lead them to death In the second trial they see Monostatos about to rape Pamina The Queen of the Night explains why she wants power She says that Tamino and Pamina will be cursed unless Sarastro is killed Tamino realizes that this is all part of the trial and he must not do anything Papageno is given food and drink by Papagena who is disguised as an old lady Tamino plays his flute Pamina appears but turns her back on him The Queen of the Night sings a very famous song in this section It is famous because it reaches the highest ranges of a female voice 

Tamino and Pamina have to go through the last trial together Papagena enters and dances then when Papageno promises to be true she throws off her disguise and disappears Pamina thinks her mother is going to use her dagger but at the last moment the boys save her and take her to Tamino Tamino plays the flute as they go together through fire and water The chorus sing in triumph

Papageno cannot call Papagena back with his shepherd pipe The three boys remind him about his magic bells He plays them and Papagena appears They are united

In the last scene Monostatos and the Queen of the Night enter to do battle but they are defeated Good triumphs over evil

Mozart belonged to a group of Freemasons The Magic Flute is full of Masonic symbols For example the number three is an important number in masonry and there are lot of things in the opera that happen in threes there are three long chords at the beginning of overture and the three chords appear again in the scene in the temple Even the key is E flat major which has a key signature of three flats There are three ladies three young boys and three trials The scenery used in the early productions make it look as if the story comes from Egypt or somewhere in the East Mozart and Schickaneder meant this to have a Masonic meaning The trials are similar to the rituals in Masonic ceremonies

Tropical Storm Lee was a weak tropical storm that hardly reached tropical storm status for a short time while over the central Atlantic Ocean during late August and early September 2005 Lee was the twelfth named storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season

Tropical Storm Lee formed east of the Lesser Antilles as a tropical depression on August 28 On the next day the depression weakened into a tropical low The low then moved north and became stronger It became a tropical storm for a short time on August 31 Lee quickly weakened again into a remnant low and was absorbed by a cold front on September 2

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 24 It developed into an area of low pressure as it moved across the Atlantic Ocean It strengthened into Tropical Depression Thirteen on August 28 while 960 miles east of the Lesser Antilles Because of wind shear the depression began to fall apart It quickly weakened into a tropical low late on August 29 It had been predicted that this was likely to happen but the National Hurricane Center instead chose to forecast a little bit of strengthening in the future

The low slowly moved northwards then turned to the northeast because of another non tropical system As it moved to the northeast the low began to become organized and began to re strengthen on August 31 That afternoon the depression strengthened further into Tropical Storm Lee It got to its strongest point with winds of 40 mph in between Bermuda and the Azores While Lee was thought to have been a tropical storm for only 6 hours originally it was later learned that Lee stayed as a tropical storm for 12 hours instead

Lee quickly weakened into a remnant low It moved to the west of the non tropical system that was near it On September 1 the two systems began join together Lee began to fall apart while it was being destroyed by the non tropical system By the next day the remnant low was absorbed by a cold front

Because Lee stayed far away from land it did not cause any damage or kill any people

When Tropical Storm Lee formed on August 31 it was the second earliest time in a season for the development of the 12th named tropical storm It formed two days after the record held by Hurricane Luis in 1995 This made it one of the few storms of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season to not hold a record for the earliest formation of the nth storm Also while this was the first use of the name Lee to name an Atlantic storm after the retirement of Hurricane Lenny in 1999 Lee had previously been used to name 3 storms in the Western Pacific Ocean Because Lee did not cause any damages or kill any people its name was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization and will be on the list of names for the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season

The Lesser Antilles are a group of islands that is located between the eastern edge of the Caribbean Sea and the western Atlantic Ocean while some of the islands are also located just off the northern coast of South America

A cold front is a meteorological word that is used to describe the movement of a cooler airmass into an area of warmer air  The air with greater density moves under the less dense warmer air lifting it which can cause a line of showers and thunderstorms or a squall line to form when there is sufficient moisture This upward motion causes lowered pressure along the cold front On weather maps the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of trianglesspikes pointing in the direction of its movement Cold fronts can also move up to twice as fast as warm fronts

A separating funnel is a piece of laboratory equipment made mostly of glass and is used to separate two liquids that usually are very hard to separate for example Oil and Water

For this example oil and water will be used A mixture of oil and water is put into a separating funnel and then shaken and then left until it becomes stable again The liquid with higher density in this case water goes to the bottom of the separating funnel When this is done the bottom of the Separating funnel is opened and the water flows out leaving only the oil left

A separating funnel is a cone shape made from glass but has a half circle or hemisphere on top It has a stopper at the top and tap or hole at the bottom The size of one can be between 50 mililitres and 3 litres

Microplate readers are laboratory equipment used to see any biological chemical or physical change in samples of chemicals in microtiter plates 

Most of the time a very bright lamp shines light to the microtiter well and the chemicals react in special ways which can be measured using special equipment

Other ways to measure certain things are

Today plate readers come with tools for data analysis

Plate readers are used for

Using these plate readers can help human scientists do their work more efficiently Plate readers are used mostly in research to find drugs and to help test the purity of chemicals in pharmacies and laboratories

A microtiter plate is a flat plate with lots of wells used as small test tubes 

A microtiter plate is used mostly in laboratories and pharmacies A microtiter plate could have 6 24 96 384 or even sometimes 1536 wells arranged in rows Some microplates used in the industry have been built with 3456 or sometimes 9600 wells for maximum efficiancy Each well of a microplate can only hold very small amounts of liquid

The first microplate was made in 1951 by a Hungarian man called Dr G Takatsky who made a microtiter plate with 6 rows of 12 wells Microtiter plates started being used in bulk in the late 1950s a man called John Liner from USA had made a different but better version By 1990 more than 15 companies were making microtiter plates People say that 125 million microplates were used in 2000 alone

In 1996 the Society for Biomolecular Screening wanted to make the microplate have standards to live up to And so in 2003 microplates had to have a certain diameter and depth

Instrument companies have made plate readers which can detect specific biological chemical or physical changes in chemicals in these plates

A prostitute is a person most of the time a woman who has sex with people for money Prostitution is sometimes called the worlds oldest profession There have been stories of it in almost every culture and society 

Some prostitutes walk the streets looking for customers They are usually called streetwalkers and are the most noticeable type of prostitutes Others may work at a building called a brothel Other prostitutes may work from their homes or from an apartment rented for the purpose and have their clients get ahold of them by phone or on the internet Some prostitutes may have a boss who may be called a Madame or a Pimp Not all prostitutes have a boss some get business through an escort agency which is a business or person the prostitute pays to advertise for them and get clients for them Many prostitutes just work for themselves The city of Amsterdam is famous for its prostitutes in the Red Light District In the Red Light District some of the prostitutes sit in windows to show that they are available for business

The legal status of prostitution varies from country to country Many countries have laws about prostitution Some countries have made prostitution illegal There are four main approaches to handling prostitution

Examples In some countries like Turkey prostitution is legal if done with a license from the government but illegal on the streets In some Muslim countries prostitution is not only illegal it is punished by death In Japan only certain sex acts are legal vaginal sex for money is against the law while oral sex for money is legal

There are some places where prostitution is legal but advertising for it is not One such example is Germany In the Netherlands both prostitution and advertising for it are legal Covert advertising is still done It can take different forms

There are different problems surrounding prostitution some of them are shortly outlined below

Prostitution in some form or other has always existed and probably will always exist One of the problems is that some of the activities linked to prostitutions are dangerous and sometimes illegal Where it is illegal it is often controlled by criminals who run brothels as they run a black market There is also the problem of human trafficking prostitutes are often forced to work They are also prone to being exploited Some people say that making prostitution legal where it is not will not solve these problems The same people would run the businesses but they would no longer be criminals The situation for the prostitutes would probably not change much as the ways the former criminals run these businesses would not change much either Other people see a different problem Legalizing prostitution would lead to some legal prostitution that would well regulated and probably worked well On the other hand there would also be the illegal prostitution which would not change much

One of the first targets of law enforcement actions against illegal prostitution is to find the people who force people into prostitution This is called sexual slavery Sex trafficking is when people are taken somewhere in order to be a prostitute It might be done by forcing them or by tricking them in some way Sex trafficking is one type of Human trafficking Some people have called human trafficking the fastest growing form of modern day slavery and the third largest and fastest growing criminal industry in the world

According to a study done in 2006 approximately 800000 people are trafficked across national borders each year and millions trafficked inside their own countries This includes all types of human trafficking although trafficking for prostitution is thought by some to make up a large portion of trafficking Because it is illegal it is hard to find out the real number of women or children forced into sex work The study estimated that eighty percent of transnational victims are women and girls and up to half of them may be minors 

Children are sold into the global sex trade every year Often they are kidnapped or orphaned In some cases they are even sold by their own families According to the International Labour Organization the problem is well known in Thailand the Philippines Sri Lanka Vietnam Cambodia Nepal and India  

The main causes of human trafficking are poverty war and other social issues Some women are made to believe promises of a better life sometimes by people who are known and trusted to them Traffickers may own legitimate travel agencies modeling agencies and employment offices in order to gain womens trust Others are simply kidnapped Once overseas it is common for their passport to be taken away by the trafficker and to be warned of the consequences should they attempt to escape This may include beatings rape threats of violence against their family and death threats It is common particularly in Eastern Europe that should they manage to return to their families they will only be trafficked once again  

Globally forced labour generates 31bn half of it in the industrialised world a tenth in transition countries the International Labour Organization says in a report on forced labour Trafficking in people has been made easier by porous borders and advanced communication technologies it has become increasingly transnational in scope and highly lucrative within its barbarity  

In some countries counselling accommodation and specialist care exists to help trafficked people escape In other countries this support is lacking and individuals are often treated as illegal immigrants and deported

One of the big problem is that of child prostitution Many prostitutes are children This means that people caught with these prostitutes may also face charges of having sex with a child In most countries prostitutes do need to be of a certain age which is usually higher than the age of consent Usually having sex with a child is punished harshly

Certain people travel to other countries to have sex with children which is forbidden where they live Many countries have changed their laws so they also apply outside their territory The crime is usually not discovered so these laws are rarely enforced

A girl is a female child She is a female human who is not yet matured although female teenagers may also be called girls Sometimes older people still refer to grown up women as girls especially in expressions such as a night out with the girls 

Little girls still have the body of a child It is not until they reach puberty that their bodies start to mature and they become a woman During puberty a girl develops breasts their hips and shoulders widen and they begin to have periods

The word girl was used a long time ago by some people called Anglo Saxons 

The opposite of a girl is a boy A boy is a male child who will grow into a man

The way girls are brought up will be vary a lot between different cultures In Western cultures a girl traditionally wears a dress or skirt However many girls wear trousers these days like boys especially when dressed informally Girls often grow their hair longer than boys although this can vary a lot according to quickly changing fashions

Traditionally girls play with dolls a lot They are also more interested in clothes than boys and they like dressing up and making up Boys often prefer rough games and enjoy playing with mechanical things such as toy cars and trains People today have long discussions about whether this is because they are born like that or because that is the way society expects them to behave

The traditional colour for a girl is pink For boys it is blue When a baby is born in a hospital it usually gets a pink or blue tag on its wrist or ankle according to whether it is a girl or a boy

Some names are girls names others are boys names There are some names which can be for girls and boys

In some countries such as Britain old girl means a grown up who used to be a pupil at a particular school Used in any other way old girl sounds rude

Exploitation means using things that are available in order to benefit from it It is usually used in a bad sense although it can be used in a good sense as well

If a person exploits a situation it means that they realize that they can use the situation to do something which will be good for them Very often this also means that it will be bad for other people

People can be exploited This means that someone else uses the peoples knowledge or skills in order to make them do something for them Socialists often talked about the exploitation of the masses when they were saying that Capitalism was bad They meant that a few rich people were using all the working people to do hard work for them so that they themselves could become rich

Exploiting people still goes on today

Tropical Storm Tammy is the nineteenth named storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Tammy was a tropical storm that only existed for a total of two days and brought minor damages to the southeastern United States It peaked with 50 mph just before making landfall on the northern Florida coast Most of the damages were losses from FEMA that totaled up to 30 million

Tammy formed from a strong non tropical low on October 5 just off the Floridan coast It moved north peaking with 50 mph winds jus before making landfall on Atlantic Beach Florida on October 6 dissipating shortly after Tammys remnants were absorbed by a cold front in the Gulf of Mexico

A tropical wave left the African coast on September 24 and crossed the Atlantic without strengthening or changing But on October 2 the wave began to strengthen and organize itself while north of the Lesser Antilles It continued to strengthen as it moved through the Bahamas and early on October 5 it became a well organized tropical disturbance off the coast of eastern Florida

As the system already had tropical storm force winds it was immediately named Tropical Storm Tammy also skipping tropical depression status The forecasts from the National Hurricane Center stated that Tammy would travel north possibly parallel to the coast which also meant that it is uncertain where Tammy wold make landfall

Tropical Storm Tammy strengthened a little bit more to its peak with 50 mph winds before it made landfall near Atlantic Beach Florida later that same day Tammy then moved inland over Georgia and soon weakened to a tropical depression before losing all of its strength on October 6

The remnant low slowly movedsouth towards the Gulf of Mexico before being absorbed by a cold front which affected much of the northeastern United States over the next few days The NHC watched the system to see if any of the low level circulation would redevelop over the Gulf of Mexico but unfavorable upper level winds did not allow any restrengthening as it was predicted

A tropical storm warning was given out at short notice for the coast from Cocoa Beach Florida to the Santee River South Carolina as soon as Tropical Storm Tammy formed on October 5 Tammy moved inland the southern end of the warning zone eventually moving north to Altamaha Sound Georgia before all warnings were discontinued on October 6

Tropical Storm Tammy caused minor damage The main concern with Tammy was flooding The highest sustained wind recorded with Tammy was 50 mph reported a few miles northeast of the center The highest wind gust reported with Tammy was near 60 mph Several areas in northeast Florida and southern Georgia reported sustained winds of 40 mph due to Tammys large wind field Rainfall totals related with Tammy were mostly in the 3 5 inch range though some isolated amounts received 10 inches of rain In Georgia Several homes were damaged because of flooding Also in Georgia several roads were washed out and two pond dams were broken Storm surge related with Tammy was in the 2 4 feet range Many boardwalks were washed away and there was some beach erosion in Florida Georgia and South Carolina In addition to the flooding an F0 tornado was reported which caused moderate roof damage and broke trees in Brunswick Georgia Total damages from Tammy was around 30 million 16500 people were reported in southeast Georgia without power during the height of the stormThe remnant low of Tammy was absorbed by a larger extratropical low which moved north and Tammys moisture helped create a different storm over the northeast US killing ten people and causing moderate damage

When Tropical Storm Tammy formed on October 5 it was the earliest ever in the season that the twentieth storm formed breaking the previous record held by Storm 20 from 1933 by 21 days Tammy was only the second Atlantic storm to be named with the letter T after Tanya in 1995 This was also the first time Tammy had been used to name any tropical cyclone worldwide Because Tammy caused minor damages in general its name was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization and will be on the list of names for the 2011 Season

Rumi was raised at a time of great upheaval in the Near East Born in what is now Afghanistan he travelled far and wide with his mother and father the latter a preacher and legal scholar Sources suggest that one reason for the familys constant movements were the ongoing wars between the Islamic states of the region and the invading Mongols Following the death of his father in 1230 he was tutored for many years by the close friend and disciple of his father Sayyid Burhaneddin 

Until his late thirties it appears that Rumi had no serious interest in the grand tradition of Islamic mysticism According to tradition and his own testimony the trigger for his conversion was a meeting in 1244 with one Shams al Din Tabrizi in Konya Anatolia then capital of the Seljuk Empire A wandering mystic who disdained the formal demands of Shariah law Shams convinced Rumi that at certain moments it was possible to commune directly with God Rather than believers simply being interpreters of the word of God they could in fact experience his presence directly 

The effect on Rumi was immediate abandoning his familial and scholarly responsibilities he devoted all his time to learning as much as possible from Shams However the mystic came and went without explanation and vanished permanently in 1248 Perhaps murdered by a member of Rumis own family in an attempt to end Shams influence this final disappearance had the opposite effect From then on Rumi devoted himself to poetry and primarily to the topic of love His verses inspired by Shams  more than 30000 in all  were collected in a work that he called Diwan i Shams i Tabrizi Stylistically Rumi favoured the well established ghazal a traditional Persian meter of up to twelve rhyming lines 

Rumi seems to have been permanently engaged in a search for those who could provide him with divine inspiration After the Diwan was completed Rumi found a new idol in Salah al Din Zarkub a goldsmith After Zarkubs death it was the turn of one of Rumis students Husam al Din Chelebi to inspire the master During these latter years Rumi composed his other great masterpiece the Mathnavi i Manavi which was dictated in its entirety to Chelebi over the course of many years 

Although there had been a substantial Islamic mystical tradition prior to Rumi it is fair to comment that his biography and poetry transformed both thinking and ritual in this regard For example the famous centripetal dance of the dervishes  the sama  is said to have its inspiration in Rumis own movements around a pole in his garden as he mourned for his companion Shams In recent times the love poetry of Rumi has found great favour in the West

Tropical Storm Bert was a weak storm that only lasted from June 28 to June 29 Bret hit the eastern coast of Mexico on June 29 before dying inland Bret was also the second storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season

Tropical Storm Bert formed close to land over the Bay of Campeche on June 28 before making landfall on Mexico a few hours later on June 29 Bert killed a total of two people

Tropical Depression Two formed from a tropical wave over the Bay of Campeche on June 28 and quickly strengthened and became a tropical storm Bret then began to move steadily closer to land during the next few hours before making landfall near Tuxpan Veracruz in eastern Mexico early on June 29 with 40 mph winds

Bret quickly weakened as it continued inland making heavy rain over the eastern coast of Mexico before dissipating over the mountains in central Mexico late on June 29

Damages in Mexico totaled up to 9 millionMost of the damage came from floods and landslides caused by the heavy rain Several towns were flooded very badly including Naranjos and Chinampa This was mainly because of the overflowing of the Ro Tancochin A total of about 3000 homes were damaged

Two people were reported dead because of Bret Two people inside a car were killed when the car was swept away by the floodwaters in Naranjos

Tropical Storm Harvey was a strong tropical storm that moved across the Atlantic Ocean from August 2 to August 8 Harvey was the eighth named storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season The storm caused no damages

Harvey formed from a tropical wave to the southwest of Bermuda on August 2 and passed close to Bermuda on August 4 bringing heavy rain to the island The storm then began to move east and away from Bermuda which the storm then reached its strongest strength with 65 mph before becoming an extratropical cyclone on August 8 The system stayed in the northern Atlantic Ocean for a few more days before it died out later

A tropical wave moved west from the African coast on July 22 and went across the Atlantic Ocean without becoming stronger When the wave came across the Leeward Islands on July 28 the National Hurricane Center began to watch the system closely for any possible strengthening which did not happen at that time By August 2 conditions had become more favorable and Tropical Depression Eight formed about 350 miles southwest of Bermuda

The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Harvey the next day But a lot of wind shear gave Harvey some subtropical characteristics and also made the official forecasts to underestimate the future strength of the storm

Harvey passed 45 miles south of Bermuda early on August 4 with winds of 60 mph before removing its subtropical characteristics to become a fully tropical storm As it moved northeast away from the island the storm strengthened more to its strongest with winds of 65 mph Without any notice more wind shear did not cause Harvey to weaken somewhat although the storms path did become confusing Harvey became a strong extratropical storm during the night on August 8 The storm lived for a few more days before dissipating northwest of the Azores on August 14

As Tropical Storm Harvey came closer to Bermuda a tropical storm warning was given out late on August 2 Because it was considered possible for the storm to continue gaining strength a hurricane watch was given out the next day As the storm began move away from Bermuda on August 4 the hurricane watch and the tropical storm warning were cancelled

Harvey brought heavy rain to Bermuda with just over 5 inches reported at Bermuda International Airport The rain caused some flooding of the roads Also there was a report of 45 mph winds over Bermuda The storm did not cause any bad damage or kill any people on the island

When Tropical Storm Harvey formed on August 3 it was the earliest time ever in a season that the eighth tropical storm formed It beat the previous record held by a storm in This was the fourth time that the name Harvey had been used to name a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic It was also the sixth time worldwide However because Harvey did not cause any bad damage the name was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization and will be used again during the 2011 season

It is the third Fibonacci number and the third and fifth Perrin numbers

Even though it is a prime number two is also a highly composite number because it has more divisors than the number one The next highly composite number is four

Vulgar fractions with 2 or 5 in the denominator do not yield infinite decimal expansions as is the case with most primes because 2 and 5 are factors of ten the decimal base

Two is the base of the simplest system of numbers in which natural numbers can be written concisely being the length of the number a logarithm of the value of the number the binary system is used in computers

For any number x

Powers of two are central to the concept of Mersenne primes and important to computer science Two is the first Mersenne prime exponent

Taking the square root of a number is such a common mathematical operation that the spot on the root sign where the exponent would normally be written for cubic roots and other such roots is left blank for square roots as it is considered tacit

The square root of two was the first known irrational number

As of 2008 there are only two known Wieferich primes

Success may mean

A parachute is usually an umbrella shaped device on which people or things can float slowly and safely down to the ground from a great height such as an aircraft

The word parachute comes from the French words parer meaning to protect and chute meaning fall carefully down making sure you are safeDrogue parachutes are used to aid horizontal deceleration of a vehicle or to provide stability

Parachutes have got a lot of air resistance which means what ever is inside is safe and secure If there was no air restance in parachutes people would injur themseves but they have got air restistance so people are safer

Parachutes are used in a sport called parchuting

The inventor Leonardo Da Vinci believed that one day humans would fly Most of his inventions were never made However we found notebooks containing drawings of parachutes and decided to build it

The word parachute comes from para meaning against or counter in Ancient Greek and chute the French word for fall Some modern parachutes are classified as semi rigid wings which are maneuverable and can make a controlled descent to break on impact with the ground Only slightly later a more sophisticated parachute was sketched by the polymath Leonardo da Vinci in his Codex Atlanticus dated to ca 14852 Here the scale of the parachute is in a more favorable proportion to the weight of the jumper Leonardos canopy was held open by a square wooden frame which alters the shape of the parachute from conical to pyramidal3 It is not known whether the Italian inventor was influenced by the earlier design but he may have learnt about the idea through the intensive oral communication among artist engineers of the time4 The feasibility of Leonardos pyramidal design was successfully tested in 2000 by the British Adrian Nicholas and again in 2008 by another skydiver5 According to the historian of technology Lynn White these conical and pyramidal designs much more elaborate than early artistic jumps with rigid parasols in Asia mark the origin of the parachute as we know it

The oldest known depiction of a parachute by an anonymous author

An American paratrooper using an MC1 1C series round parachute A parachute is carefully folded or packed to ensure that it will open reliably If a parachute is not packed properly it can result in death because the main parachute might fail to deploy correctly or fully In the US and many developed countries emergency and reserve parachutes are packed by riggers who must be trained and certified according to legal standards Sport skydivers are always trained to pack their own primary main parachutes

Parachutes can malfunction in several ways Malfunctions can range from minor problems that can be corrected in flight and still be landed to catastrophic malfunctions that require the main parachute to be cut away using a modern 3 ring release system and the reserve be deployed Most skydivers also equip themselves with small barometric computers that will automatically activate the reserve parachute if the skydiver himself has not deployed a parachute to reduce his rate of descent by a preset altitude

Exact numbers are difficult to estimate but approximately one in a thousand sports main parachute openings malfunction and must be cut away although some skydivers have many hundreds of jumps and never cut away Reserve parachutes are packed and deployed differently They are also designed more conservatively and are built and tested to more exacting standards making them more reliable than main parachutes However the primary safety advantage of a reserve chute comes from the probability of an unlikely main malfunction being multiplied by the even less likely probability of a reserve malfunction This yields an even smaller probability of a double malfunction although the possibility of a main malfunction that cannot be cut away causing a reserve malfunction is a very real risk In the US the average fatality rate is considered to be about 1 in 80000 jumps Most injuries and fatalities in sport skydiving occur under a fully functional main parachute because the skydiver made an error in judgment while flying the canopyresulting in high speed impact with the ground impact with a hazard on the ground that might otherwise have been avoided or collision with another skydiver under canopy

The United States Capitol is the building where the United States Congress meets It is the center of the legislative branch of the US federal government It is in Washington DC on top of Capitol Hill at the east end of the National Mall 

The capitol has a large dome in the center above a rotunda  a large space that is shaped like a circle  There are two wings that are connected to the rotunda on opposite sides The north wing is where the Senate meets and the south wing is where the House of Representatives meets These wings are also called chambers On the top floors of the chambers are galleries or balconies where people can watch the Senate and House of Representatives from above

The Statue of Freedom is on top of the capitol

The first capital city of the United States was New York City At this time Congress met in City Hall from 1785 to 1790 When the capital was moved to Philadelphia Pennsylvania Pennsylvania from 1790 to 1800 the Philadelphia County Building became the capitol In 1800 the capital moved again to Washington DC and a new capitol building was built

The capitol was designed by William Thornton Construction started in 1793 but it was not completely finished until almost twenty years later The Senate started to meet in the capitol in 1800 when the Senate wing was finished The House started to meet in the capitol in 1807 even though the House wing was not finished until 1811 

At that time it was not as big as it is now The dome in the center of the building was smaller and made of wood In 1814 the capitol was set on fire by the British Army during the War of 1812 In the 1850s and 1860s the capitol was fully repaired and the wooden dome was replaced with a larger iron dome The walls of the Senate wing were painted with many murals about events in American History Inside the rotunda a large fresco was also painted on the ceiling during the repair 

The Supreme Court also met in the Capitol until its own building was completed in 1935

Front wheel drive or FWD is a car setup where the cars power is at the front wheels This makes the car safe in wet and snowy conditions because it has better traction or grip to the road But FWD can cause uneven weight which may cause brakes to fail if used for large periods of time

Rear wheel drive or RWD is when a car uses its rear wheels to move This is good for dry roads and for acceleration or how fast you move forward as the weight is pushed backwards on the back wheels But RWD cars can spin out also called oversteer or fishtail This can cause crashes if the driver is new and not familiar with RWD cars

The word wireless is normally used to refer to any type of electrical or electronic operation which is done without a hard wired connection Wireless communication is the transfer of information over a distance without the use of wires The distances involved may be short or very long

The term wireless technology is generally used for mobile information technology equipment Examples include mobile phones personal digital assistants Global Positioning System units garage door openers wireless computer mice and keyboards satellite television and cordless telephones

Shah is a Persian word which means the king or ruler of a country This word is used in different countries in the world including Iran India Pakistan and Afghanistan Presently the term Shah is used as a surname commonly by many people in India Pakistan and Afghanistan who are Hindu Moslem and Jain The reason as to how so many non muslims have the surname Shah is unknown Many Indian names which have Shah in them the most famous of them is Shah Jahan who as the Emperor of India ordered the creation of Taj Mahal One possible etymology of the chess term checkmate is the Persian shah mat meaning the king cannot escape

The term Shah is also widely known to mean the male monarch of Iran during the long lasting Iranian monarchy The Iranian monarchy was overthrown in 1951 and a country headed by a Prime Minister with a parliamentary legislative body the Majlis was established Mohammad Mossadeq was the Prime Minister However in 1953 the US launched a coup replacing Mossadeq with the Shah who was in Rome 

Approval voting is a voting system used for elections In approval voting each person can vote for any number of candidates he likes The votes for each of the candidates are counted and summed up The candidate or candidates with most votes are chosen as the winners of the election

Supporters argue it to be better than plurality voting because voters can vote for the lessor of evils advertised by the media but also for their favorite candidates If their goal is just to vote against a candidate they can do so more forcefully by approving all other candidates Ballots can easily be hand counted if voters do not trust computers which might be needed for Instant Runoff Voting Vote spoiling is not an issue with approval voting so many candidates may run for office

Opponents argue that voters still have some of the problems of plurality voting which is that they do not know if they will need to compromise vote or not Giving approval to a compromise candidate could result in that compromise candidate winning when their favorite would have won had they not given approval to the compromise candidate It is possible for 51 of voters to view a candidate as their first choice but for that candidate to lose to a compromise candidate because many of those voters approved the compromise candidate as well Not knowing whether or not to compromise is a problem with all voting systems when at least three strong candidates run

An agar plate is a Petri dish that contains agar and some nutrients It is used to grow microorganisms For example a blood sample of a patient may be put on agar plate to let the bacteria that made him sick grow These bacteria can then be identified using a microscope to let the doctor choose the appropriate treatment of the patient

The Seasons is an oratorio by Joseph Haydn An oratorio is a long musical work with orchestra choir and solo singers It usually tells a story from the Old Testament of the Bible The Seasons is different It is about the four seasons of the year It describes nature and peoples relationship to nature during the year

The Seasons was the last big work that Haydn composed He composed it in 1801 By this time he was the most famous composer in Europe Mozart had died ten years earlier and Beethoven was a young man who was just starting to become famous Haydn was nearly 80 years old and his health was not good Although he lived another eight years The Seasons was the last big work he wrote Soon after he had composed it he stopped composing altogether

Haydn had only written one big oratorio before The Seasons This was an oratorio called The Creation It had been performed in 1798 and was very popular all over Europe The libretto had been written by Baron Gottfried van Swieten who was an Austrian nobleman who liked music He had helped Mozart in his career and now he was helping Haydn He wanted Haydn to write a second oratorio so he wrote the libretto for The Seasons He used a long English poem with the same title by James Thomson He made it much shorter and changed it so that it was suitable to be set to music and he translated it into German 

Haydn took two years to write the music It was first performed in Vienna on 24 April 1801 The audience liked it although not as much as The Creation One problem was that Haydn was not very happy about the libretto He thought that oratorios should be about serious dramatic stories from the Bible or from classical mythology not about everyday life Van Swieten was not very happy when Haydn criticized it but he did not change it and Haydn did his best to make the work interesting

The oratorio is divided into four parts one for each of the seasons Spring Summer Autumn and Winter Each part lasts at least half an hour and consists of the usual recitatives arias choruses and ensemble numbers There are three soloists They represent three simple country people There is a soprano called Hanne a tenor called Lucas and a bass called Simon Hanne is supposed to be Simons daughter There is no storyline in the normal sense it is a series of poems and thoughts about nature during the year 

The opening of Spring describes winter going away and spring awakening There is a chorus which sounds very pastoral with its 68 rhythm and drones Simon then sings about the farmer sowing his seed He is accompanied by a bassoon which sounds like a lively farmer tilling the earth There is a gentle hymn of praise with a fugue which sounds like one from Mozarts Requiem Hanne invites the girls and Simon invites the men to go to the fields and admire the earth water and air A chorus praises God

The music describes the countryside The farmer is called to work in the morning The sun rises Again we thank God for nature By midday it has become very hot Later there are insects buzzing and we hear a shepherd playing on his pipe Everything is very dry at first then there is a storm The timpani make the sound of the thunder When the storm has finished everyone is happy We hear the birds singing the frog croaking and the evening bell chimes eight times The days work is done

The words at first are about hard work and the rewards for hard work Then there is a duet for a loving young couple This is the only time that the soloists feel like real characters in a story and talk to one another Autumn is the hunting season so there is hunting music It sounds quite old fashioned The bassoon is the hound The hounds become hungry and the music gets faster and faster until suddenly the dogs and the music stop There is a gunshot as the deer is shot Autumn finishes with a drinking chorus

At first there is thick winter fog Then there is a short song Then there is a story about a traveller who is lost in the snown and comes to a cottage where he finds shelter Hanne and the chorus sing a song about a spinning wheel Many other composers later wrote music which describes a spinning wheel turning There is another song which tells a story about a wealthy nobleman who tries to make love to a country girl but she escapes by riding off on his horse so he is left with no horse and no girl At times this music sounds quite like the music in Mozarts opera The Magic Flute Simon sings an aria which compares the seasons with the different stages of life Finally the chorus sing about the dawn of life in heaven The oratorio and the seasons start all over again The soloists who have been three country people are now three angels There is a final hymn of praise

Federal could mean

Federalism is a political philosophy in which a group of people are bound together with a governing head In federalism the authority is divided between the head and the political units governed by it

Currently several countries in the world have a federal government examples are United States of America Canada Switzerland and Austria The European Union can be called a sort of federal government as well

An example of federalism is how in the United States the federal government and state governments both have power When states and the federal government do not agree on something the Supreme Court can decide who is right

A federation is a union of a number of self governing states or regions which are joined together under a central government The central government is not able to do a lot of things that central government in more centralized states can These things are done by the states in a federalized state

The United States of America is a federation The federal government has the highest executive role but the states have their own special rules in some special cases

Australia became a Federation in 1901 After the 1971 civil war Pakistan became a Federation adopted in the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan

A federal republic is a federation of states with a republican form of central government It differs from a unitary state in that in a federal republic the authorities of the state governments cannot be taken back by the central government

Many countries have a federal republic government for example the Federal Republic of Brazil the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia the Federal Republic of Germany the Republic of India the United Mexican States the Federal Republic of Nigeria the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the United States of America As this list shows some of these countries use Federal Republic in their name and some do not Federal Republics usually have presidents

Tropical Storm Franklin was a strong tropical storm that stayed in the western Atlantic Ocean for much of its life Franklin was the sixth named storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and almost became a hurricane two times

Tropical Storm Franklin formed north of the Bahamas on July 21 and moved steadily across the western Atlantic while coming close to Bermuda on July 26 Later Franklin became an extratropical cyclone near Newfoundland before being absorbed by another non tropical system Franklin caused no damages and killed no people while it stayed in the ocean during most of its life

A tropical wave formed west from the African coast late on July 10 The wave entered the Bahamas on July 21 and strengthened into Tropical Depression Six while 70 miles east of Eleuthera Initially the storm was predicted to move in a clockwise loop and slowly move to the west in response to a high pressure system Several models showed the possibility of the storm to change westward and move into central Florida Anyhow soon after the depression formed it strengthened into Tropical Storm Franklin

Tropical Storm Franklin suffered a lot of wind shear related with the development of Tropical Storm Gert which made the forecasters at the National Hurricane Center to say that Franklin could be destroyed in the next few days However the shear stopped as Franklin moved to the northeast allowing the storm to strengthen The forecasters now said that Franklin could attain and maintain hurricane strength and make a close approach to Bermuda Shortly after on July 23 Tropical Storm Franklin reached its strongest point with 70 mph winds

Franklin moved unevenly to the east while weakening as shear increased again The NHC predicted that the storm would dissipate but Frnaklin stopped weakening on July 25 with Franklin a minimal tropical storm The storm passed to 200 miles to the west of Bermuda on July 26 and moved slowly northwards into the warmer waters of the Gulf Stream The shear also reduced once again allowing Franklin to re strengthen somewhat with winds reaching 60 mph on July 28 Meanwhile Franklin began to accelerate to the northeast becoming an extratropical cyclone on July 30 to the south of Newfoundland The extratropical storm passed close to the southern tip of Newfoundland later that day and was absorbed by a larger system on July 31

As Tropical Storm Franklin was forming a tropical storm warning was issued for the northwest Bahamas but it was cancelled as Franklin moved north and away from the islands A tropical storm watch was given out to Bermuda on July 25 but was also cancelled a day later when Franklin moved away

Tropical Storm Franklin developed very close to land in the Bahamas and passed close to Bermuda but there were no reports of tropical storm force winds overland with the strongest gust recorded on Bermuda being 37 mph After Franklin became an extratropical storm it affected parts of southeastern Newfoundland bringing about 1 inch of rain to the area There were no damages or fatalities reported from Tropical Storm Franklin

When Franklin formed on July 21 it was the became earliest tropical cyclone ever in a season that the sixth tropical storm formed breaking the previous record held by storm 6 from 1936 by 14 days This was the first use of Franklin to name a tropical storm after the retirement of Hurricane Floyd from 1999 Because Frank filed to cause any deaths or damages its the name was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization and will be on the list of names for the 2011 Season

Tropical Storm Jose was a tropical storm that lived for a very short time from August 22 to August 23 Jose was the tenth named storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season which made landfall in eastern Mexico

Tropical Storm Jose formed off the coast of Mexico in the western Gulf of Mexico on August 22 and made landfall on eastern Mexico the next day while at its strongest point with 60 mph winds Jose then quickly dissipated while inland and caused heavy rain Jose killed a total of eight people who were all killed by landslides and caused 45 million in damage 

On August 17 a tropical wave probably from the same wave from which Tropical Depression Ten had developed from earlier in the month began to organize in the central Caribbean Convection steadily increased as it moved to the Yucatn Peninsula The system then weakened while overland and by the time when it entered the southweatern Gulf of Mexico on August 21 it hardly had any convection However early in the morning of August 22 under highly favorable upper level conditions convection quickly increased and the system became Tropical Depression Eleven about 110 miles east of Veracruz Mexico The depression quickly strengthened as it moved to the west becoming Tropical Storm Jose just six hours later after forming

The global model guidance originally failed to predict the storms track well with some models showing that it would somehow stop offshore Jose continued to strengthen as it moved towards the coast and made landfall in the state of Veracruz early on August 23 with winds at its strongest at 60 mph As Jose made its landfall an eye was beginning to form although the storm was still short of hurricane strength Tropical Storm Jose quickly weakened after landfall and dissipated that afternoon in the mountains of central Mexico only 24 hours after forming

Because Tropical Storm Jose formed so close to shore there was only a lead time of less than 9 hours on the tropical storm warning given out on September 22 for the Veracruz coastline The area covered by the warning was also enlarged southwards as Jose intensified before being cancelled soon after landfall on September 23 The advisories that were given out by the National Hurricane Center stated that rainfall from Jose was the probably the biggest threat

Tropical Storm Jose was responsible for damaging crops highways and homes flooding many areas in several cities in the state of Veracruz and 80000 people had to be in shelters The government of that state estimated the damages caused by the storm to be about 45 million An estimated 120 citites were affected by the rains but the majority of the damage was limited to eight of them Martnez de la Torre Misantla Nautla San Rafael Vega de la Torre Actopan Cardel and rsulo Galvn Damage to the highway infrastructure was estimated at 33 million

It was also reported that the storm damaged at least 16 thousand homes and about 250 square kilometres of land used for cattle In addition over 420 square kilometres of various crops including sugar cane corn and bananas were flooded Many boats were also lost as a result of Jose 90 active medical brigades were sent to the region to reduce the risk of infections to the affected people living in the destroyed area

In addition Jose was responsible for killing people six directly One of these deaths was the result of a landslide that killed a man in Xalapa Veracruz The other five deaths were also due to landslides in Oaxaca 

When Tropical Storm Jose formed on August 22 it was the earliest date for the formation of the tenth tropical storm in an Atlantic hurricane season breaking the previous record held by Tropical Storm Jerry from 1995 by 1 day This was also the third time the name Jose had been used to name a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic As Tropical Storm Jose create any major damages its name was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization and will be on the list of names for the 2011 season

Hurricane Cindy was a tropical cyclone that reached minimal hurricane strength for a very short time in the Gulf of Mexico during July and made landfall in Louisiana It was the third named storm and first hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Cindy was originally thought to have been a strong tropical storm at its strongest strength but was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane in the post storm analysis

Hurricane Cindy formed on July 3 just east of the Yucatn Peninsula in the Caribbean Sea The depression soon made landfall on the peninsula and weakened before entering in the Gulf of Mexico on July 4 The storm restrengthened as it moved north becoming a hurricane just before making landfall on southern Louisiana on July 5 The storm weakened as it moved inland and became extratropical on July 7 

Cindy was responsible for a total of 3 deaths in the United States andfor bringing heavy rains to Louisiana Mississippi Alabama and Maryland An unusually strong F2 tornado formed from Cindys remnants and caused a lot of damage in Hampton Georgia Cindy also caused flooding and a very big blackout in New Orleans Louisiana which encouraged the people to evacuate when Hurricane Katrina destroyed the city in the next month 

On June 24 a strong tropical wave formed off the African coast and moved quickly west across the Atlantic Ocean without any strengthening The wave steadily became more organized as it came to the Caribbean Sea and late on July 3 it strengthened into Tropical Depression Three about 80 miles east of Chetumal Mexico The models originally had difficulty predicting the future path of the depression and the forecasts from the National Hurricane Center agreed with this predicting that the depression would maybe hit TexasAnyhow the depression developed quickly before making landfall on Yucatn Peninsula early on July 4 with 35 mph winds Cindy then began to lose its most of its strength and organization as it moved inland

A new center of organization began forming later on July 4 when Cinday entered the Gulf of Mexico This reorganization caused a notable change in the models which now predicated a landfall in Louisiana The depression moved north in the Gulf of Mexico and became a Tropical Storm Cindy early on July 5 Weakened shear allowed Cindy to strengthen more as it approached Louisiana and was a minimal hurricane with 75 mph winds for a very short time when it made landfall near Grand Isle late on July 5 While it was thought that Cindy did not originally reach hurricane strength but post season reanalysis confirmed the upgrade

Hurricane Cindy weakened back into a tropical storm as it crossed over southeastern Louisiana and Breton Sound before making a second landfall near Waveland Mississippi with 50 mph winds on July 6 Cindy moved to the northeast over Mississippi and Alabama weakening to a tropical depression that day The depression became extratropical over South Carolina on July 7 and moved to the northeast dissipating in the Atlantic Ocean on July 9

About 300000 homes and businesses in southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi coastline lost electrical power while a storm surge of 4 6 feet affected the same area causing some beach erosion in southern Louisiana

In New Orleans Louisiana wind gusts reached 70 mph many trees were destroyed or uprooted and various street flooding was reported As thousands lost electrical power the city experienced its worst blackout since Hurricane Betsy 40 years earlier Although at the time Cindy was still listed as a Tropical Storm by the weather service many in New Orleans thought that Cindy was a hurricane and referred to it as Hurricane Cindy before it was officially upgraded

Even though Cindy had weakened to a depression and was deep inland Cindys effects were still felt some parts of Atlanta Motor Speedway and Tara Field airport in Hampton Georgia suffered heavy damage from an F2 tornado created by the storm Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta had over 5 inches of rain on July 6 its sixth highest one day rainfall since 1878 most rain fell during just two hours This is more rain than the area normally gets in all of July Many other places such as Slidell Louisiana Gulfport Mississippi Mobile Alabama and Salisbury Maryland also saw over 5 inches of rain

Cindy was also reported to have caused three deaths two in Georgia and another in Alabama

Many people in the New Orleans metropolitan area thought Cindy would only create minimal effects from the storm but found themselves cleaning up the mess and were without power for days after Cindys strike The experience encouraged many people to evacuate when the much more powerful Hurricane Katrina was heading towards the city less than two months later

When Tropical Storm Cindy formed on July 5 it was the seventh time that the name had been used to name a storm in the Atlantic Because Cindy did not cause any major damages its name was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization and will be on the list of names for the 2011 season

Hurricane Epsilon was a Category 1 hurricane that lasted a long time in the central Atlantic Ocean during late November and early December Epsilon was one of the strongest and longest living hurricanes recorded so late during the year It was also the twenty seventh tropical or subtropical storm and fifteenth hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season

Epsilon formed from a non tropical low that steadily became a tropical storm on November 29 The storm became a hurricane on December 2 in a highly unfavorable climate for a regular tropical cyclone Anyhow Epsilon managed to stay as a hurricane for a few more days while confusing and frustrating forecasters at the National Hurricane Center before dissipating on December 8

Tropical Storm Epsilon developed out from an extratropical storm in the central Atlantic Ocean on November 29 that had slowly gained tropical characteristics similar to Tropical Storm Delta It was far east from Bermuda at the time and never would get close to land Epsilon steadily strengthened into a strong tropical storm before it weakened a little bit on December 1 The official forecasts from the National Hurricane Center predicted Epsilon would weaken further in the highly unfavoritable environment before becoming an extratropical system again Unexpectedly Tropical Storm Epsilon strengthened again on December 2 and became a hurricane over cooler waters about 2124C with continuing wind shear which are the conditions that are highly unfavorable for a regular tropical cyclone The official forecasts continued to predict weakening and dissipation but Epsilon did not follow the forecasters predictions and remained at hurricane strength for several more days At one point on December 4 it was thought that Epsilon had weakened into a tropical storm for a short time but later post analysis showed that Epsilon had never weakened at all Hurricane Epsilon then strengthened further to its peak intensity of 85 mph just several hours later

Hurricane Epsilon frustrated many forecasters back in NHC and the because Epsilon continued to deny any weakening made NOAA hurricane forecaster Dr Lixion Avila to say There are no clear reasons and I am not going to make one up to explain the recent strengthening of Epsilon This means I dont know why the storm has gained strength and I am not going to make up a reason The storm kept its hurricane strength for five days while most of the six hourly forecasts during that period called for it to weaken below that hurricane strength Dr Avila also claimed that Epsilon had developed a structure similar to one of an annular hurricane which somehow helped it to keep its strength even though poor conditions still existed

On December 7 wind shear began to cause Hurricane Epsilon to weaken The storm lost strength and it became a tropical storm on the next day It continued weakening into a tropical depression on December 8 and it dissipated soon after that

Because Hurricane Epsilon stayed far out at sea and never came near land no warnings or watches were sent out by the National Hurricane Center No ships in the ocean reported high winds from Epsilon Also the storm caused no damage or deaths

When Tropical Storm Epsilon formed on November 29 it was the first known time that the 27th tropical or subtropical storm had formed in the Atlantic Ocean during one hurricane season Hurricane Epsilon was only the 6th ever Atlantic hurricane in December Epsilon spent more time as a hurricane during December than any other Atlantic storm This broke the old record held by Hurricane Lili in 1984

Tropical Storm Alpha was the twenty third tropical or subtropical storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Alpha was the first tropical cyclone to be named with Greek alphabets after the seasons list of names ran out

Tropical Storm Alpha formed in the eastern Caribbean Sea on October 22 where it steadily moved towards Hispaniola later making landfall on the island on October 23 Alpha then quickly weakened and dissipated over the Atlantic Ocean on the next day Alpha caused a total of 43 deaths in the island

A tropical wave which had formed off from the western African coast on October 15 moved to the Caribbean Seaand reached the Windward Islands on October 19 The wave slowly strengthened and organized into a tropical depression about 180 miles southwest of San Juan Puerto Rico on October 22 Later that day despite wind shear from powerful Hurricane Wilma nearby it strengthened into a tropical storm as it moved west northwestward On the morning of October 23 it made landfall on the Dominican Republic with 50 mph winds then moved over to Haiti

As it crossed Hispaniola Alpha was weakened to a tropical depression because of the islands tall mountains A cold front pulled Alpha northward where it moved into the Atlantic Ocean and began to travel alongside Hurricane Wilma to the southwest On the afternoon of October 24 Alpha became disorganizied into a remnant low which also made the National Hurricane Center to stop giving out tropical cyclone reports for the system Later Alphas remnant were absorbed by Hurricane Wilma

A total of 43 people have been reported dead because of Tropical Storm Alpha while 26 were from the direct effects of the storm 

Government officials in the Dominican Republic ordered the evacuation of at least 30000 people living in places where flooding was possible About 1000 people remained in shelters Alpha caused nine deaths in the Dominican Republic alone including two fishermen who went missing at sea during the storm and a fourteen year old boy who was swept away by floodwaters in the town of Guaricanos

A river in Haiti overflowed its banks and flooded a neighborhood in the Port au Prince suburb of Carrefour killing seventeen people including two were electrocuted one drowned and five were swept to their deaths by the water Also twenty three people were reported missing including nineteen from the town of Leogane sixteen of whom were later confirmed dead bringing the death toll in Haiti to 33 This is a much lower death toll than originally feared tropical systems which affect Haiti such as Hurricane Jeanne from 2004 were usually among the deadliest as the badly deforested Haiti which is extremely vulnerable to landslides and lacks basically any form of tropical alert system

At least 400 homes were damaged by the storm including twenty three homes that were washed away

One unconfirmed report told that a child was swept out to sea by Tropical Depression Alpha FactdateApril 2009

Since the 2005 season had already used up all the assigned hurricane names the Greek alphabet was used and the storm was named Alpha once it reached tropical storm strength The name Alpha has been used before in the Atlantic for a subtropical storm but the 2005 season was the first time to have a Tropical Storm Alpha 

At the time it was thought that Alpha was the twenty second storm of the season and so was the storm which broke the 1933 seasons record for most storms in just one season However post season analysis revealed that there was also an earlier subtropical storm which made Alpha the twenty third storm of the season Alpha was the first tropical storm to be assigned a Greek alphabet name after the list of hurricane names were all used up This was just one of many records set by the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season

A bchner funnel is a piece of laboratory equipment which is used to filter or separate a liquid from a solid It is named after an industrial chemist called Ernst Bchner

A Bchner funnel can be made out of porcelain glass or plastic On the top there is a container with a hole in the bottom This container is put on top of a Bchner flask with a hole in the top and a hole in the side In between the container and the Bchner flask there is a piece of filter paper which lets through liquids but not any solids Attached to the hole in the side there is a vacuum which sucks the air out of the Bchner flask This means that when any mixture is poured into the top the liquid is sucked through the filter paper and the solid is left stuck in the filter paper

A Bchner flask is used in organic chemistry to take unwanted solids out of any liquids The advantages of using a Bchner flask over just a piece of filter paper held over a beaker is that the solid is dried as more and more liquid is sucked off of it by the vacuum Most of the time it needs to be dried again in an oven but sometimes no further drying is needed

Hurricane Alicia was the first named storm and first hurricane of the 1983 Atlantic hurricane season Alicia was the seasons strongest and most deadliest storm of the season while killing a total of 21 people and causing 26 billion in damage Alicia was the most destructive Texan hurricane since Hurricane Carla from 1961

Hurricane Alicia formed from Tropical Depression Three on August 15 in the Gulf of Mexico and slowly moved west towards Texas where it made landfall on August 18 at its strongest point with 115 mph winds Alicia quickly weakened into a tropical depression before dissipating overland on August 21

A mesoscale low formed off the Alabama and Mississippi coasts on August 14 with a weak frontal trough that had formed off of New England Pressures were high in the Gulf of Mexico but the low strengthened into Tropical Depression Three on August 15 A ship located within 60 miles of the depression reported a pressure of 10155 millibars and the storm was upgraded to Tropical Storm Alicia late on August 15 With the high Gulf pressures Alicia was unable to gain size so it stayed very small but created faster winds and became a Category 1 hurricane on August 16 Steering currents were weak during Alicias lifetime over water A new frontal ridge had formed on August 17 which caused the storm to slowly move in a westerly direction Alicia continued west until the frontal ridge had collapsed to the east

Alicia then began to take a more northern drection August 18 to Port Arthur Texas During that time the hurricane began to gain strength at about 1 mbar an hour peaking at 963 mbar with winds of 115 mph on the morning of the 18th Just before landfall Alicia showed a rare double eye feature for a few hours The storm made landfall in Texas as a category 3 hurricane at about 145 am CDT on Thursday August 18 Alicia weakened very quickly after landfall losing tropical characteristics and began to speed up to the northwest finally losing its identity in the southeast Nebraska on August 21

Several hurricane watches and warnings were given out that were related with Alicia The first ones were a gale warning and a hurricane watch for the area of Corpus Christi Texas to Grand Isle Louisiana which was given out on August 16 On August 17 a hurricane warning was issued for Corpus Christi to Morgan City Louisiana and later for Port Arthur Texas Originally however residents did not take the warnings seriously Galveston Mayor E Gus Manuel against the advice of Texas Governor Mark White ordered the evacuation of only low lying areas

30 percent of Galvestons population evacuated the island when Hurricane Allen threatened the eastern Texas coastline in 1980 only 10 percent of the population living behind the seawall chose to leave when Alicia made landfall Throughout the day however as increasing winds began to cause damage in Galveston people grew more worried The mayor finally ordered a widespread evacuation of the island after midnight on August 18 but by then the bridges to the mainland were no longer usable as they have been broken

The city of Galveston reported 7 inches of rain Liberty reported 9 inches and Greens Bayou reported almost 10 inches of rain Centerville reported over 8 inches with Normangee and Noxia reporting over 7 inchesMaximum rainfall in the Houston area in Harris County was about 10 11 inches 8 inches of rain was reported in Leon County and 9 inches in the Sabine River area High gusts were also reported throughout Texas with a maximum gust of 125 mph reported on the Coast Guard cutter Buttonwood stationed at the northeastern part of Galveston Island Pleasure Pier reported tides of 867 feet with Pier 21 reported a little over 5 feet Baytown Texas reported 10 12 feet tides and 121 feet at Morgan City the highest recorded by Alicia

Twenty three tornadoes were reported that were either related or caused by Alicia fourteen of those were located in the Galveston and Hobby Airport area The other nine were concentrated around Tyler to Houston Texas ranging around F2 on the Fujita scale A major oil spill occurred around Texas City with over sixty gallons having to be cleaned up by the National Weather Service and an ocean going tugboat capsized 50 miles of the Sabine Pass coast The Coast Guard Air Station Houston weathered Alicia with minimal damage and afterwards AIRSTAs helicopters helped residents with evacuation supply and survey flights

The Galveston NWS office lost its radar Houston suffered billions of dollars in damage Thousands of glass panes in downtown skyscrapers were shattered by gravel blown off of rooftops Houston Lighting and Power reported that about 750000 homes were without electricity after Alicia hit Many stores had to stay closed for days afterward due to risks of falling glass in the area In Galveston the western beach had its public beach boundary shifted back about 150 feetAn entire wall of the Flagship collapsed About 5 feet of sand was scoured leaving beachfront homes in a natural vegetation state The beachfront homes after Alicia were in violation of the Texas Open Beaches Act and the Attorney Generals office forebade the repair or rebuilding of those homes The Corps of Engineers stated that if the Galveston Sea Wall was not there that another 100 million dollars in damage could have occurred Also if Alicia was the size of Hurricane Carla from 1961 damage could have easily double or possibly tripled Alicia also did damage to chemical and petrochemical plants in Houston

Hurricane Carla in the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season hit a less populated area as where with Alicia hit a more populated area Had Alicia been the size or strength of Carla damage could have easily doubled or tripled

Heavy amount of rainfalls were recorded with 8 14 centimeters in the southern central part of Texas from a curved path Rains reached up to 5 inches in the same area however rainfall was limited to that area Kansas only got 1 3 inches which were recorded in the eastern to central parts of the state The southeast part of Nebraska received one inch of rain from Alicias remnants Michigan Iowa Minnesota Louisiana and Wisconsin all received one inch of rainfall 

Hurricane Alicia brought useful rains to the southern Great Plains which had been suffering from a drought for much of the summer of 1983 In the end Hurricane Alicia killed 21 people and caused 2 billion in damage

There was heavy amount of rainfalls were recorded with

The Red Cross had to provide food and shelter to 63000 people in the hurricanes wake costing to about 166 million dollars FEMA gave out 32 million to Alicias victims and local governments 23 million of that was to go picking up trash and wrecked objects spread after Alicia More than 16000 people wanted help from FEMAs disaster service centers The Small Business Administration aided with 56 volunteers interviewed over 16000 victims and was predicted that about 7000 loan applications would be requested The Federal Insurance Agency had closed over 1318 flood insurance cases from Alicias effects however only 782 received final payment

On September 23 and September 24 1983 in the wake of Alicia two subcommittees of the US House of Representatives had trials in Houston The hearing on September 23 were to examine the main problems of the National Weather Service during Alicia the effectiveness of the NWS in current events and the use of the National Weather Service The second hearing which occurred on September 24 was to talk about the damage and recovery efforts during Alicia

On the September 23 hearing witnesses agreed that the National Weather Service did well before and during the emergency caused by Alicia NWS forecaters also gave evidence in which they said they thanked themselves that their predictions were well on target and that the local emergency plans worked so well which saved many lives Mayor Gus Manuel on Galveston said that the NWS did an excellent job during Alicia He was also very impressed about their landfall predictions on August 17 before Alicia made landfall

On the September 24 hearing evidence was brought upon which demonstrated the need improving to the readiness to cope with disasters such as Alicia Mayor Manuel mentioned that his town needed stronger building codes which were under review

The name Alicia was retired in the spring of 1984 becoming the 30th storm name to be retired and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane It was replaced with Allison in the 1989 season The name Allison was coincidentally retired after doing major damage to the same the area in 2001

Giza pyramid complex is on the Giza Plateau near the city of Cairo Egypt It is about eight kilometres 12000 miles inland into the desert from the ancient town of Giza on the Nile and about 25 kilometres southwest of Cairo city centre The Great Pyramid is the only remaining monument of the Seven Wonders of the World

There have been many theories to expain how the pyramids were built These theories include

The Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the walls of Babylon are one of the Seven Wonders of the World They were built by Nebuchadnezzar II around 600 BC He is told to have built the gardens to please his wife Amytis of Media She wanted to see the trees and plants of her homeland The hanging gardens were destroyed in an earthquake after the 1st century BC

Some people do not believe the Hanging Gardens were real In ancient writings the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were first described by Berossus a Chaldean priest He lived in the late 4th century BC Greek historians later wrote more about them

Recent archaeological digs of the palace in Iraq have uncovered evidence of a building with vaults and a well nearby However the place of the palace complex is different from where Greek historians said they were which was on the banks of the Euphrates River

However recently there have been digs on the banks of the Euphrates River of some large 25 meter thick walls

It is said that the Hanging Towers Of Babylon were originally blown down and this building is a second production

The Statue of Zeus at Olympia was one of the Seven Wonders of the World It was carved by the famous sculptor Phidias around 432 BC in Olympia Greece

The Temple of Artemis also known as Temple of Diana was a temple dedicated to Artemis It was completed around 350 BC at Ephesus under the Achaemenid dynasty of the Persian Empire Only ruins remain of the temple It was one of the Seven wonders of the World

The Temple of Artemis was near the ancient city of Ephesus about 50 km south from the modern port city of zmir in Turkey

Most of the description of the Temple of Artemis comes from Pliny though there are different accounts and the actual size varies

Pliny said the temple was 115 meters long and 55 meters wide He said it was made almost completely of marble It was about three times as big as the Parthenon by area The Temple has 127 Ionic styled columns Each of them are 175 meters in height

The Temple of Artemis had many fine artworks bronze sculptures by famous Greek sculptors Polyclitus Pheidias Cresilas and Phradmon were in the temple Paintings and gilded columns of gold and silver were also in it The sculptors often competed at creating the best sculpture Many of these sculptures were of Amazons who are said to have founded the city of Ephesus

Pliny said that Scopas who also worked on the Mausoleum of Mausollos worked carved reliefs into the temples columns

Athenagoras of Athens names Endoeus a student of Daedalus as the sculptor of the main statue of Artemis in Ephesus

The Temple of Artemis was at a flourishing region It was used as a religious institute Merchants and travellers came to it from all over Asia Minor The temple was influenced by many beliefs It can be seen as a symbol of faith for many different peoples The Ephesians worshiped Cybele They joined many of their beliefs into the worship of Artemis Artemisian Cybele became very different from the Roman goddess Diana The cult of Artemis attracted thousands of worshipers from far off lands They all gathered at the site and worshipped her

A Bchner flask is a flask made of glass

A Bchner flask has thick walls so that a pressure change will not break it It has a hole in the top where a Bchner funnel can be put and a small tube in the side where a vacuum can be attached The small tube has barbs on it so that the vacuum will not weaken

A Bchner flask can be used with a Bchner funnel for separating solids and liquids Water is poured into the Bchner funnel and the liquid passes through filter paper and is sucked up by a vacuum attached to the side of the Bchner flask while the solid stays behind in the Bchner funnel

The Bchner flask can also be used as a vacuum trap in a vacuum line to ensure that no fluids are carried over from the aspirator or vacuum pump to the evacuated apparatus or vice versa

The word for lighthouse in some languages is pharos or its equivalent 

Legend holds that Ptolemy I Soter would not allow Sostratus to put his name on the tower but the architect left the following inscription on the bases walls     These words were hidden under a layer of plaster on top of which was chiseled another inscription honoring Ptolemy the king as builder of the Pharos After centuries the plaster wore away revealing the name of Sostratus

With a height estimated at between 115 and 145 meters it was among the tallest man made structures on Earth for many centuries It was identified as one of the Seven Wonders of the World by Antipater of Sidon It was the third tallest building after the two Great Pyramids It was destroyed by earthquakes

Divers discovered remains of the lighthouse in fall 1994 on the floor of Alexandrias Eastern Harbour Some of these remains were brought up and were lying at the harbour on public view at the end of 1995 An episode of the PBS television series Nova chronicled the discovery Later satellite imaging has revealed further remains It is possible to go diving and see the ruins

An aspirator is a device that makes vacuum because of the Venturi effect In the aspirator fluid flows through it The tube gets more thin making the fluid flow faster and making the pressure smaller Then vacuum is taken from it The aspirator is also known as an ejector or a filter pump

The most common type of aspirator is the water aspirator It is used in laboratories for chemistry and biology The aspirator has a fitted tee which is attached to a faucet It has a hose barb on one side The flow of water passes through the straight part of the tee which restricts the water flow at the intersection with the hose barb The vacuum hose should be connected to this barb

The strength of the produced vacuum is limited by the vapour pressure of the flowing water However the strength of the vacuum is not limited if a gas is used as the working force

The Venturi effect is a case where fluid flows through a tube that narrows The velocity of the fluid increases as it flows through the narrower tube while the pressure decreases due to conservation of energy The effect is an example of Bernoullis principle

Jun Kazama is a video game character made for the Tekken series

Jun Kazama enters the tournament in order to save Kazuya Mishima and stop his crimes However she became pregnant by him and had a son Jin Kazama 

She also appears in the new Tekken Movie Where she will be portrayed by Tamlyn Tomita

Jun is an officer of the WWWC a wildlife protection organization She is called The Chosen One by her family She is psychic and feels a weird power in Kazuya Mishima which is the Devil Gene turning him into a devil version of himself At the WWWCs orders she goes out to put Kazuya into jail who kills peaceful animals 

When the King of Iron Fist Tournament 2 was about to end Jun feels an even more powerful Devil Gene inside Kazuya

During the King of Iron Fist Tournament 2 Jun became pregnant by Kazuya Devil goes into Jin Juns unborn baby One night Jun gets attacked by Ogre and now is either missing or possibly dead

Jun is a playable character in Tekken Tag Tournament

Tekken Tag Tournament has nothing to do with the Tekken storyline

In Tekken 4 her figure appeared in the ending of Jin to prevent him from killing his grandfather Heihachi Whether it was her soul or Jins vision is still questionable since her status is labeled as missing

In the optional Devil Within minigame Jin finds clues that lead him to believe that Jun is alive but it turns out to be Ogre the alien opponent that is responsible for Juns disappearance

Harada recently posted on fan site forums that Jun Kazama is still alive and if he gets the right amount of requests he will bring her back to Tekken

About JUN there seem to be a lot of fans that think that Jun has died in the official storyline That isnt exactly true From Jins perspective in the story he believes his mother Jun has died This is the correct interpretation

Everyone says bring jun back I heard it from the same person millions of times

However Everyone is it true

If my followers increase if a lot of opinions of the person were able to be heard ill think about it

Klein first became well known when he helped a singer Bobby Darin to recover money owed to him by his record label Darin received a 100000 check for unpaid broken wikt linkroyaltiesroyalties and split it with Klein Klein was called the Robin Hood of popular music liked by artists but hated by the companies they worked for

Klein bought a struggling record label Cameo Parkway and tried to make it more profitable When he got into legal trouble for talking up the value of shares in the company he changed his plans He merged Cameo Parkway with his own accounting firm creating a company called ABKCO

Among Kleins clients were pop singers Connie Francis Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme RB singer Sam Cooke folk musician Donovan record producer Phil Spector and rock bands Hermans Hermits The Animals The Rolling Stones and The Beatles While he helped his clients with money matters and to make new contracts that paid them better not all his business choices were the best for his clients Klein ended up owning much of the music of the Rolling Stones the Animals and other artists which cut into their long term earnings The artists also sometimes lost the broken wikt linkgoodwillgoodwill of the businesses they dealt with because of Kleins work for them

Klein played a role in the breakup of the Beatles He impressed John Lennon enough to sign up with him overnight and Lennon persuaded George Harrison and Ringo Starr to go along Paul McCartney though decided to let his wife Lindas father Lee Eastman become his manager Eastman and Klein did not get along and Eastman treated Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono poorly Disagreements on what the Beatles should be doing with their company Apple Corps and their own business interests helped to tear the band apart

After the Beatles broke up Lennon Harrison and Starr liked the things Klein did for them less and less and eventually split with him giving Klein a final payment of about 35 million for his services Later Klein got into tax trouble and served a jail sentence for broken wikt linkincome taxincome tax broken wikt linktax evasionevasion

Klein continued his career and ABKCO continued to issue records from the old Cameo Parkway label and the artists Klein had managed Nearly all the records were taken off the market for many years making classic songs like 96 Tears So Much In Love by the Tymes and Bristol Stomp by the Dovells impossible to buy

Mark David Chapman is an American best known as the murderer of musician John Lennon

Chapman grew up in Georgia and was a fan of The Beatles when they first became famous He learned to play guitar and wanted to become a musician He later became a broken wikt linkFundamentalistFundamentalist Christian and his values changed He came to believe the Beatles were a bad influence on people John Lennon in particular because of Lennons views on God and religion When Lennon released his song Imagine in 1971 many Fundamentalists did not like it Chapman parodied the song singing it as Imagine John Lennon dead

As years went by Chapman had little success and much trouble in his personal life His hopes to become a broken wikt linkmissionarymissionary were dashed when a civil war started in the country where he went on a mission He returned to the United States and later moved to Hawaii He married a Japanese woman as Lennon had done but the marriage was not happy Chapman worked a low paying job as a broken wikt linksecurity guardsecurity guard

In 1980 after years of retirement Lennon made a new album Double Fantasy with his wife Yoko Ono Chapman learned from a book where Lennon lived in New York City and that it was not hard to find him around town Chapman flew to New York a few times that fall thinking about what he wanted to do He thought about committing suicide before deciding finally he wanted to kill Lennon He felt that doing this would somehow lessen the problems in his own life

On December 8 1980 Chapman again visited New York actually meeting Lennon and Ono as they left home to go to a recording session Lennon signed a copy of Double Fantasy for Chapman and a photographer took a picture of the two men together Chapman waited around until they returned As Lennon entered their apartment building Chapman drew a pistol called out to Lennon then shot him several times Lennon collapsed and died later on the way to a hospital from blood loss

Chapman did not try to get away and was reading a book The Catcher in the Rye when police came to the scene They arrested Chapman who later pled guilty to Lennons murder telling the court God had told him to do so He was sentenced to twenty five years to life in prison in 1981 He later wrote to Yoko Ono trying to apologize to her and explain his actions but she never answered In 1985 an actor named Mark Lindsay Chapman lost the chance to portray Lennon in a movie about his life with Ono because his name was similar to that of Lennons killer

When Chapman became eligible for parole he applied but was turned down Yoko Ono gave a statement to the court telling them that Lennons death still hurt her and their son Sean Lennon every day and they still felt his loss She reminded them of how Chapmans act was only one among many celebrity broken wikt linkstalkingstalkings and murders and that paroling Chapman might give others the idea that what he did was acceptable The court heard her words and Chapman continues to be refused parole

Lennons murder was echoed in December 1999 when a young man Michael Abram broke into the home of another former Beatle George Harrison carrying a knife He wanted to kill Harrison for many of the same reasons Chapman killed Lennon Harrison and his wife Olivia fought back however with Olivia striking Abram with a lamp and the pair holding him down until police arrived Harrison was stabbed by Abram but he recovered Abram was sent to a mental hospital

It is believed that Chapman will never leave prison in his lifetime because of the impact of his crime His name has been used in arguments promoting gun control claiming that he would not have killed Lennon if he could not get a gun Many fans of Lennon have threatened to kill Chapman if he was ever released from prison In 2000 Chapman claimed that Lennon would have wanted him to be free saying I think he would be liberal I think he would care

A bacteria bed is a layer of sand which is used to clean air or water from bacteria and other microorganisms It is actually a type of filter

A filter is a device used to remove unwanted parts from something For example removing solid particles from a liquid Filter can also mean the act of filtering it can be used as a verb The different branches of science and technology often mean a particular kind of device when filter is mentioned

The simplest filter is the kind called filter paper Liquids can pass through the paper Solid particles are stopped

More advanced filters are possible Two that are often used to make water more pure are activated carbon and zeolites

Filters are used to remove unwanted items andor impurities in the substance you are filtering

The most usual thing meant by filter in electrical science is a wave filter This is a filter which will let through some frequencies and stops all others For instance a filter can be used in a radio to select the station the listener wants to hear The frequency of that station is passed but all others are rejected

There are many other uses including use in telephones and audio

There are digital filters which can be used to filter things besides frequencies A common use is to improve the quality of pictures For instance there are filters which can make the edges of objects look more clear

Optical filters act on light They change it certain ways This can be used for photographic filters

Filters can be made from mechanical components They will do very similar things to electric filters Most especially mechanical filters can be wave filters That is they can block some frequencies and pass others Because of this electric filters are sometimes made by first making a mechanical filter The electric wave is turned into a mechanical movement then passed through the filter then turned back in to an electric wave This kind of filter is often made from quartz crystals

A device which changes electrical signals into mechanical signals is called a transducer A device which changes mechanical signals into electrical signals is also a transducer but one of a different kind

An internet filter removes certain kinds of information For example certain words can be blocked

Jury nullification means cancelling by jury

It means that jurors the people that sit in jury can say that some law is against the Constitution or against justice If that law is against these things then jurors can free a man in trial

Jury nullification gives jury the power to judge the laws that Congress has written In other words the jurors are not only testing the man in trial but also the law itself

Jurors are regular everyday people not like judges who are placed by the government Because of that there is an idea saying that jury nullification protects the rights of every person in the country from bad government laws

Tropical Storm Gamma was the twenty fourth named storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Gamma formed in the eastern Caribbean Sea but quickly died a few days later from wind shear On November 18 it restrengthened and became a tropical storm for a few more days before dying off the coast of Honduras on November 20 Although Gamma never made any landfall it caused minor damages in the Lesser Antilles and medium damages in Honduras

The National Hurricane Center began monitoring a tropical wave that would later become Gamma around November 11 but the system did not develop into a tropical depression until after it had passed the Lesser Antilles on November 13 At that time the storm was called as Tropical Depression Twenty Seven and was predicted to strengthen into a strong tropical storm or a weak hurricane as it moved across the Caribbean Sea However a second system developing in the southwestern edge of the Caribbean began pushing wind shear onto the depression on November 14 then weakening the depression into a tropical low advisories were then temporarily stopped On later reanalysis it was found that the depression had probably become a tropical storm by November 15 at 0600 UTC for less than 6 hours but was not named during the time

As the remnants of Twenty Seven moved west the system in the southwestern Caribbean moved onto land in Nicaragua and quickly weakened reducing wind shear on the remnant low Near Honduras the two systems combined and rapidly gained the characteristics of a tropical cyclone on November 18 when it was upgraded directly to a tropical storm and given the name Gamma It is clearly unknown whether the remnant low of Gamma absorbed the low pressure system or happened the other way but forecasters at the National Hurricane Center though that it was more likely that Gamma absorbed the other system

Gamma strengthened a little bit more to reach its maximum strength of 50 mph winds during that day but a trough moving into the Gulf of Mexico stopped any more strengthening Gamma stayed just north of the coast of Honduras for about a day then weakened to a tropical depression as it was beginning to be absorbed into the front as it entered the Caribbean On November 20 wind shear had destroyed Gamma and advisories were stopped although the low level circulation of Gamma survived for an extra 36 48 hours Later the last remnants of Gamma were absorbed into the approaching front Gamma never made landfall as a tropical storm

Because the storm was not predicted to make landfall few preparations were taken in Honduras for the storm But non stop rainfall for more than a day as Gamma wandered offshore created floods that forced more than 23000 people to leave their homesfactdateApril 2009

As of January 24 2006 a total of forty one people were reported dead as a result of Tropical Storm Gamma mostly in Honduras with 13 missing in Honduras 

Thirty four people died in Honduras with at least thirteen other people missing All deaths were because of flooding and mudslides rather than wind damage since tropical storm force winds did not affect the mainland

According to the COCEP dozens of bridges were washed away and about 2000 homes were destroyedFactdateFebruary 2007 According to the NHC 10 bridges were destroyed from flooding and 7 were damaged And 5200 acres worth of banana crops were also destroyed causing 13 18 million in damage In addition an unofficial report of 444 inches of rain was reported on Roatan Island

Five fishermen who were at sea during Tropical Storm Gamma have been reported missing and as of November 25 were thought to be dead after five unidentified bodies were found on the Honduran coast Three people were killed in a plane crash from Gammas outer rain bands it was thought that the weather was a part of the reason Other effects to Belize were minimal

Two people were killed by a mudslide in St Vincent and the Grenadines from Tropical Depression Twenty Seven when the system came close to the island Seven homes were also destroyed by flood waters in the area and others were damaged 

Other effects across the rest of the Lesser Antilles were minimal and were no worse than that of a normal rain event Also two fishermen who were reported dead in Jamaica were thought to have been killed by Gamma 

After Gamma slowly moved away from land Honduran government officials carried out helicopter rescues for people and families trapped by flood waters as UN agencies began airlifting food and water to the impacted areas 

The government of Andaluca in Spain donated 40 million lempiras to aid in disaster efforts and the United States sent helicopters to help in the delivery of food to the people affected by the storm

Because damage was minimal Gamma was not retired and will be used again whenever the regular list of names is all used up in the future

After all of the twenty one assigned hurricane names for the 2005 season were used up after Hurricane Wilma the Greek alphabet was used starting with Tropical Storm Alpha This storm was named Gamma once it was known to have reached tropical storm strength This was the first time that the name Gamma had been used for a tropical cyclone

Because Gamma was the only twenty fourth tropical storm to form in any single Atlantic hurricane season Gamma also holds the record for being the earliest twenty fourth tropical storm reaching tropical storm strength on November 18 Gamma also extended the 2005 seasons record for tropical storms to twenty four which was also enlarged four more times and ended at twenty eight storms after Tropical Storm Zeta and a post season addition of an unnamed subtropical storm which went originally unnoticed in October Also Gamma tied the record set during the 1992 Pacific hurricane season for most storms in a single basin monitored by NOAA

Tropical Storm Delta was a late forming tropical storm which affected the Canary Islands and Morocco as a strong extratropical storm It was also the twenty sixth tropical or subtropical storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season

Tropical Storm Delta formed out from an extratropical cyclone that slowly gained tropical characteristics It was also a subtropical storm for a very short time before becoming Tropical Storm Delta on November 22 Delta then moved slowly and stubbornly to the Canary Islands It became extratropical again on November 29 just before passing north of the islands

On November 22 a non tropical low pressure system in the central Atlantic Ocean began to gain some tropical characteristics Late that afternoon the low became Subtropical Storm Delta while located over 800 miles west southwest of the Azores Originally the National Hurricane Center thought that the storm had already gained enough tropical characteristics to be classified as a regular tropical storm but in post storm analysis this was changed

The storms circulation became more organized and Delta became a tropical storm on November 24 It strengthened further to its maximum strength of 70 mph winds later that day just below hurricane strength The official forecast at this time predicted that Delta would strengthen further and become a minimal hurricane but this did not happen Anyhow Delta kept this strength for a few days as it moved slowly and zig zaggedly in the central Atlantic As wind shear increased over the storm a Delta began weakening on November 25 and by the end of the next day Delta had weakened into a very weak tropical storm Some of the computer models showed that the weakening tropical storm could be absorbed by a developing low to the west which a few days later became Hurricane Epsilon This did not happen and Tropical Storm Delta began to move to the northeast

As Delta sped up to the northeast heading to the Canary Islands it strengthened again reaching a second peak of just below hurricane strength on November 27 In post storm analysis the National Hurricane Center said that Delta had probably reached hurricane strength for a very short time during that day but the data was not persuading enough to upgrade the storm to hurricane status On November 28 as Delta moved closer to the Canary Islands Tropical Storm Delta lost much of its tropical characteristics The extratropical storm which maintained winds of near hurricane strength came close to about 105 miles while north of the islands that night The storm later made landfall on Morocco early on November 29 and quickly weakened overland dissipating later that day over northwestern Algeria

A lot of damages was reported in the Canary Islands from the effects of Delta where it was described as a historic event as hurricanes are very rare there The islands of Tenerife and La Palma were hardest hit with many uprooted trees and landslides reported there The strongest gust recorded at La Palma was 152 kmh and at Tenerife the maximum gust was 147 kmh One hospital had to be evacuated and several airports were closed across the islands In all more than 225000 customers lost electricity and many lost telephone service

Also a famous natural tourist attraction El Dedo de Dios a geological feature which had been pointing towards the sky for more than a millennium and an important landmark for the Canary Islands was destroyed by Deltas winds and wave movement along Gran Canarias shore Gran Canaria it was the island that suffered more damages in its Patrimony since besides the storm destroyed centenary windows and crosses the cover of the Cueva Pintada in Galdar and stopped prisoners and without light several villages of the center of the island Delta claimed seven lives six of them were immigrants that were on a boat which sank off the Canary Islands and 12 were reported missing The seventh was a result of winds throwing a man off a house while it was being repaired during the storm

When Subtropical Storm Delta formed on November 22 it was the first and earliest time that twenty six tropical or subtropical storms had formed in the Atlantic during one hurricane season it also extended the 2005 seasons record for the number of storms in a single season

The Fall of Man is the story in the book of Genesis in the Torah of when Adam and Eve in Gods eyes lost their innocence Genesis says that Adam and Eve ate from the Tree of Knowledge even after God told them it was not allowed Adam and Eve lost their innocence and were thrown out of the Garden of Eden where the Tree of Knowledge was In Christian religion all of man lost their innocence because Adam and Eve disobeyed God and had to be punished so man can now tell good from bad and life from death

The Fall for many Christians means that humans could not make themselves holy enough to get into Heaven when they died The only way they became able to get into Heaven is when as they believe Jesus Christ sacrificed himself and made it possible for people to get back into Heaven

Many people in Judaism Christianity and Islam believe the story of the Fall as fact but their explanations of it are sometimes different The Fall is not talked about in The Old Testament but Adam being thrown out of Eden is and what happened in Genesis and what happened in the Quran are very different

Islam believes that The Fall was just a historic event and did not change human nature at all It believes that because Adam ate from the Tree of Knowledge he and his wife were thrown out of the Garden of Eden and forced to work and suffer But God still gave others who were still loyal to him the chance to get into Heaven

According to Jewish tradition the biblical story tells that Adam and Eve had the free will to rebel against Gods first commandment Gods first commandment was not to eat from the fruits of the Tree of Knowledge in the middle of the Gardenof Eden Adam and Eve ate from its fruits and had to pay a price They were thrown out of the Garden of Eden which is called Paradise Further on they had to suffer and work for a living Furthermore Adam and Eve became as the bible tells like God They got the gifts of knowledge wisdom selfawareness  things that distinguishes humans from animals 

Judaism teaches ever since Moses that Adam and Eve did not sin but simply did not obey Gods commandment They were the first humans and had no experience with Gods commandments Adam and Eve were innocent of God and his commandments Therefore they barely could sin at all Judaism teaches that a sin is personal It believes that a sin is a disobedience of Gods commandments Judaism teaches ever since Moses that any sin could not be inherited by others Sins can not be inherited by other people not to babies children or adults especially not to the entire human race Judaism believes that no one ever has inherited an Original Sin Likewise Judaism believes that no one needs a special counteragent against it Judaism teaches that if required every person should take the inward turn should take stock of oneself Any person feeling sinful or guilty may pray directly to God and ask for forgiveness Any person feeling sinful or guilty may beg for somebodys personal pardon if one has to make up for something Judaism teaches that every person can get to heaven and  once more  near to God It teaches that no one has to become Jewish or someone special to get to heaven 

The very basic Jewish teachings of the story of The Fall are

In general Christians believe that everyone who was related to Adam was born with sin and would never make it into Heaven Jesus who was related to Adam only through his mother and had no sin died for everyone who had sin cleaning them They believe that whoever believed in Jesus Christ was given a second chance to get back into Heaven shown in St Johns Gospel God so loved the world that he sent his only son that whoever believes on him should not perish but have everlasting life Some types of Christianity have slightly different ways of viewing this described below

Catholicism believes that people are born sinful but have free will and so they can clean themselves of their sin and can get into Heaven after the grace of God has changed them so that they want to do that without this first grace the sinful people do not want to go to Heaven

Calvinists believe that God chooses the humans who were going to go to Heaven and those who were not Humans do not get a choice in spiritual matters

Puritans took this one step farther Puritans said that humans could do nothing to be able to get to Heaven They said that no matter how good a person was if he had not been chosen by God at birth he would not go to Heaven However one could lose the right to go to Heaven by being bad

Protestants believe that when Jesus sacrificed himself he made man free from sin forever Other people believe that when Jesus sacrificed himself man was free from sin but he was not certain that he would still get into Heaven

Some Christians say that the story of The Fall in Genesis 3 never happened but is just a myth or story that the Israelite people used to show that the relationship that man had with God is gone

This view is quite neutral towards history It does not say that evolution is a lie and says Bible stories that man failed in the Garden of Eden and needed to be saved are explanations of deeper spiritual truths Some also say that Jesus Christ was God trying to start a new relationship with man

Eastern Orthodoxy believes that a son is not guilty of the sins of his father They believe that men and women are forced to sin because of the world around them and thy have to try and resist if they want to go to Heaven But they still believe that Adam caused all humanity to have to work for this The emphasis on free will is great even the sinful people can be saved through synergywith Gods grace

Pelagianism says that humans are capable of freely choosing good or bad decisions without Gods help and that humans are not born with Adams sin

Mormonism believes that The Fall was part of a plan thought up by God so that His children could get into Heaven

Mormons say that when Adam ate from the Tree of Knowledge it was not wrong but was just a demotion like going from one good job to another less good job A step down but progressing in a forward direction Mormons refer to The Fall as a Transgression For Mormons a sin is the act of doing something contrary to the known will of God and to do so willing with full knowlegde Transgression on the other hand is the violation of a law or rule So for Mormons all sins are transgressions but not all transgressions are sins Since Adam didnt have knowledge of good and evil before partaking of the forbidden fruit so his act was a transgression of the law not a sin against the law Before eating the fruit Adam could never die Because he could never die he could never go to heaven Eating the fruit made it so that Adam could die so that later he could go to heaven It also made it so that Adam and Eve could have children so that everyone would have a chance to live die and go to heaven Mormons say that if one follows the Plan of Salvation that person can go to heaven Mormons believe that

Unification Church believe that Adam and Eve had sexual relations before they were married and so they got thrown out of the Garden of Eden They believe that a Blessing Ceremony can wash this sin away

The Unity church believes that The Fall of Man has an important meaning but that it is not a true historic event

Uniterian Universalists believe that people are inherently good and that it is their most precious gift free will that allows people to sometimes act wrongly rather than predestination or external temptation The Fall is story metaphor allegory not a history 

Philip Pullman wrote a series called His Dark Materials and he says in the book that The Fall was a good thing It was when humans became free to learn Pullman believes that it is not worth being innocent if the price is not knowing the truth

CS Lewis wrote a book called Perelandra where Adam and Eve were on the planet Venus rather than the classic Garden of Eden

Albert Camus wrote a book called The Fall where a man tells another man in a bar in Amsterdam called Mexico City why he did not want to rescue a man who was trying to kill himself by jumping off a bridge into a canal

In the manga Neon Genesis Evangelion The Fall is often talked about and at the end an attempt to clean Adams sin is performed and a new genesis is started

The Colorado River is a river in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico It is approximately 1450 mi long It drains a part of the dry regions on the western slope of the Rocky Mountains 

The natural course of the river flows into the Gulf of California The heavy use of the river as an irrigation source for the Imperial Valley has desiccated the lower course of the river in Mexico Now it no longer always reaches the sea

On its way the Colorado River runs through Colorado Utah Arizona and Mexico The Colorado River drains 242900 sq mi Total flows of the river range from 4000 cubic feet per second in droughts to 1000000 fts in severe floods With the construction of massive power dams on the lower course of the river floods of over 70000 fts are rare The mean flow of the total river before diversion is 22000 fts 

Historically the flow was much higher before water usage began in the basin

Hurricane Beta was the twenty third named storm fourteenth hurricane and seventh major hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season It formed in the southwestern part of the Caribbean Sea on October 26 and made landfall on the eastern coast of Nicaragua on October 30 as a strong Category 2 hurricane Although Beta did create a lot of damage it was somehow less than originally expected

Late on October 26 a broad area of low pressure in the southwestern part of the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Costa Rica developed and became Tropical Depression Twenty Six At the second full advisory six hours later the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Beta Beta strengthened into a hurricane at 2 am EDT October 29 after spending a few hours on the border between tropical storm and hurricane strength Beta reached maximum windspeeds of 115 mph making it a Category 3 hurricane by 4 am EST October 30 The Colombian island of Providencia about 140 miles off the coast of Nicaragua was in danger to hurricane force winds for several hours as the center of the storm moved slowly very close to the island Original reports stated major damages to homes and a temporary loss of communications with the islanders

Beta made landfall in the morning of October 30 near the town of Sandy Bay Sirpi 310 kilometres northeast of the Nicaraguan capital Managua as a strong Category 2 hurricane destroying many buildings and knocking down trees It weakened as it moved onto land and dissipated into a remnant low pressure system If the system continued to move westward the remnant low could have probably re strengthened after it entered the Pacific Ocean If the storm had regenerated a new number and name would have been given

The remnants of Hurricane Beta poured heavy rain over parts of the Central America on Monday making forecasters to warn of deadly landslides and flooding as the storm began to dissipate There were numerous reports of damage but fortunately no deaths were reported although there were several reports of injuries and people missing The storm finally dissipated late in the evening of October 30 Although Beta had moved out to sea several rain bands from the remnant continued to fall on Nicaragua and Honduras on October 31

Nicaraguan government officials said that if the hurricane had hit larger coastal cities such as Puerto Cabezas or Bluefields as was first predicted it would have been a disaster Hurricane Beta was the first hurricane to be named after a letter in the Greek alphabet because the first tropical system to be named with a Greek letter Tropical Storm Alpha did not reach hurricane strength

In Puerto Cabezas Nicaragua local officials announced a curfew to help stop looting and worked to cut off electricity throughout the city to stop possible injuries 60000 people were moved into shelters Thousands of residents striggled through heavy rain to reach shelters Many experts including national meteorology director Milagros Castro warned of the threat of mudslides especially since Beta was a slow moving storm

In Honduras the government also kept a red alert for the storm and an emergency committee was working on moving 150000 people from areas of the capital Tegucigalpa that would be in danger to flooding and mudslides Evacuations were being readied in five of the countrys eighteen departments Civil defense officials have declared an alert in neighboring El Salvador fearing the threat of mudslides after Hurricane Stan destroyed much of the area The preparations eventually turned out to be very serious since there was no deaths reported in spie of the large damages

On the island of Providencia roofs were ripped off from dozens of wooden homes the islands main communications tower was knocked over and a tourist footbridge was destroyed But most of the 5000 islanders stayed safe by climbing Providencias many hills to ride out the storm in brick shelters At least thirty people are reported to have been injured during Hurricane Betas destruction upon the island

Beta wiped out most of the town of Sandy Bay as it made landfall Local reports said the towns population of 3000 had mostly evacuated in advance Wooden huts made most of the housing in Sandy Bay and about eighty percent of it was thought to be uninhabitable Trees were knocked down and roofs were ripped off from houses during Hurricane Betas attack on the country At least one pier was damaged Many herds of cattle were killed by the storm 700 people were trapped in Tasbapauni a town separated from the mainland by a lagoon Eighty percent of homes in Tasbapauni are thought to be damaged very badly Some 200 homes in Laguna de Perlas seventeen lake front villages are reported to have been damaged a lot 

Though the storms remnants were expected to drop an additional four to eight inches on the already water logged ground President Enrique Bolaos said his country had escaped a major disaster He promised to quickly get aid to separated towns cut off by flooding and landslides Nicaraguan Civil Defence Chief Col Mario Perez Cassar said eighty per cent of the buildings on the central coast where the hurricane hit were heavily damaged or destroyed

One person was reported to be injured and four people were reported missing in Nicaragua The four missing men were later found alive on a boat that had been swept out into the Caribbean A passing Panamanian registered tanker ship found the four all Miskito Indians adrift about forty eight kilometres off the Nicaraguan coast after their gasoline ran out

In Honduras Beta left fifty communities separated and broke bridges in the northeastern provinces of Gracias a Dios Atlantida and Colon on the coast Strong winds knocked down signs fences trees and electricity and telephone poles cutting off power and communication in hundreds of communities and at least two highways were blocked

Authorities evacuated more than 7800 people from north of the Nicaraguan border after four rivers overflowed from rain caused by Beta The national soccer league stopped all of its games The airports at La Ceiba and Roatan on the coast were operating intermittenly because of poor visibility strong winds and flooding Flooding damaged rice corn and bean fields High waters also sent snakes out of the jungle into urban areas although there were no reports of snakebites

Armstrong is considered by many to be one of the best frontmen to date putting Green Days live shows on the map and on magazines lists of bands to see before you die He is happily married living in Berkeley California with his wife Adrienne Nesser and two kids Jakob and Joseph

The band gained a following in the punk scene in California particularly in the Gilman Street Scene They released three EPs before releasing two LPs one being a compilation of the EPs in 1991 and Kerplunk later in the same year

The Importance of being Earnest A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde It was first performed on 14 February 1895 at St Jamess Theatre in London In the play the protagonists make up people who are not real to try to make their lives easier The plays most important themes are the light humourous way it treats serious things like marriages and the satire of Victorian ways At the time the play came out reviews all praised the plays humour However some people wanted better social messages while others thought that it was the best play Wilde had ever written It is Wildes most popular play

The plot is about two men who try to woo their respective lovers by convincing each that their name is Ernest The play includes many puns and plays on words Even the title is a pun because Ernest is a mans name and earnest is a word that means serious honest and sincere The play is about morality style and hypocrisy among others but it is noted for being humorous and lighthearted

The successful opening night marked the climax of Wildes career but also heralded his downfall The Marquess of Queensberry father of Lord Alfred Douglas Wildes lover planned to present Wilde a bouquet of spoiling vegetables and disrupt the show Wilde was tipped off and Queensberry was refused admission Soon afterwards the feud came to a climax in court and Wildes new notoriety caused the play despite its success to be closed after just 86 performances After imprisonment he wrote no further comic or dramatic work The Importance of Being Earnest has been revived many times since its premiere and adapted for the cinema on three occasions in 1952 1992 and 2002

Unlike many other plays at this time The Importance of Being Earnests light story was not about serious social or political issues This was something that reviewers at that time were not sure what to think about Though they were not sure of how serious Wilde was they agreed that the play was clever funny and popular George Bernard Shaw for example reviewed the play in the Saturday Review He said that comedy plays should not only be funny but touching saying I go to the theatre to be moved to laughter Later in a letter he said that the play was extremely funny but really heartless

In 1963 Erik Chisholm made an opera from the play

Tropical Storm Zeta was the twenty eighth and last storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season It formed very late during the year on December 30 after the official end of the season and was a very rare tropical cyclone to live during two calendar years

Tropical Storm Zeta formed on December 30 in the central Atlantic Ocean where it stayed far away from land during its whole lifetime While every forecast given to the storm predicted it to dissipate quickly Zeta like Hurricane Epsilon denied those advisories Zeta reached to its maximum strength on January 2 until finally dissipating on January 8 also bringing the close to the end of the 2005 season

Late on December 29 2005 a tropical depression developed in the east central Atlantic Ocean from a frontal trough and strengthened into a tropical storm early the next day As this was more than four weeks after the official end of the season the National Hurricane Center did not actually classify the system until after it had already become a tropical storm The new bound storm originally moved to the northwest but stopped for a few hous late on December 31 before moving west As Tropical Storm Zeta slowly gained strength it had many characteristics similar to Hurricane Epsilon like when the National Hurricane Center constantly forecasted that Zeta would weaken because of the high wind shear but Zeta still held onto its strength like Epsilon had done

Tropical Storm Zeta weakened a little bit on January 2 before strengthening again to its maximum strength with 65 mph winds on the same day One of the models suggested that Zeta could strengthen further and become a hurricane but this did not happen Tropical Storm Zeta continued to reject forecasts of weakening and on January 4 so much frustration made NHC forecaster Dr Lixion Avila to say that he had run out of things to say

The effects huge amount of wind shear finally began to affect the storm itself on January 4 as Zetas strength began to weaken This made Tropical Storm Zeta to weaken into a very weak tropical storm The NHC still continued to overestimate how fast Zeta would dissipate and early on January 5 they actually downgraded Zeta to a depression which was later confirmed to have been wrong Zeta continued to move west northwestward barely holding on to tropical storm status before becoming disorganized again Zeta weakened into a tropical depression on January 6 and dissipated into a remnant later that day finally bringing an end to the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season But the remnant low still its identity for one more day before it dissipated 660 miles southeast of Bermuda

Several of the people that were taking part in the 2005 Atlantic Rowing Race were affected with heavy seas and strong unpleasant winds from Tropical Storm Zeta The ship Liberty Star made several reports of strong winds from Tropical Storm Zeta including one of 40 mph winds early on December 31 when the ship was about 45 miles north from the center of the storm Because Tropical Storm Zeta never came close to land so no coastal watches or warnings were given out There were no reports of damages or deaths from Zeta

When Tropical Storm Zeta formed at 0600 UTC on December 31 it became the second latest forming tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean forming about six hours earlier than Hurricane Alice did in 1954 Zeta is only the second Atlantic tropical cyclone on record to have lived through two calendar years Tropical Storm Zeta also extended the record number of storms to form in the 2005 season to twenty eight seven more than the previous record held by a hurricane season from 1933 It was also the only Atlantic storm to have a name beginning with the letter Z since the list of names for Atlantic storms do not have a Z name

Canton Ticino or Ticino is the southernmost canton of Switzerland The written language is Italian in almost the entire canton It surrounds the Italian exclave of Campione dItalia Together with areas of the canton of Graubnden it makes up the so called Svizzera Italiana Lombard dialects are still spoken especially in the valleys but they have no official status It is named after the Ticino river

The canton of Ticino is located in the south of Switzerland It is almost entirely surrounded by Italy which lies to its east west and south To the north lie the cantons of Valais and Uri to the northeast the canton of Graubnden

Its area is 2812 km of which about three quarters are considered productive Forests cover about a third of the area but also the lakes Maggiore and Lugano make up a considerable part of the total area These lakes are known with the above listed names but are officially named Lake Verbano and Lake Ceresio

The canton is split geographically in two parts by the Monte Ceneri pass The northern more mountainous part called Sopraceneri is formed by the two major Swiss valleys around the lake Maggiore Ticino Valley and Maggia Valley The southern part called Sottoceneri is the region around the Lake Lugano

The River Ticino is the largest river in the canton It drains most of the canton flowing from the northwest through the Bedretto Valley and the Leventina valley to enter Lake Maggiore near Locarno Its main tributaries are the Brenno in the Blenio Valley and the Moesa in the Mesolcina Valley in Graubnden The lands of the canton are shaped by the river which in its mid portion forms a wide valley commonly known as the Riviera 

The western lands of the canton however are drained by the Maggia River The Verzasca Valley is located between the Ticino river and the Maggia river There is also a smaller area that drains directly into the Lake Lugano Most of the land is considered within the Alps but a small area is part of the plain of the River Po which drains the north of Italy

In ancient times the area of what is today Ticino was settled by the Lepontii a Celtic tribe Later probably around the rule of Augustus it became part of the Roman Empire After the fall of the Western Empire was ruled by the Ostrogoths the Lombards and the Franks Around 1100 CE it was the centre of struggle between the free communes of Milan and Como in the 14th century it was definitively acquired by the Visconti Dukes of Milan In the 15th century the Swiss Confederates conquered the valleys south of the Alps in three separate conquests

The Canton of Uri conquered the Leventina Valley in 1440 Between 1403 and 1422 some of these lands were already annexed by forces from Uri but subsequently lost In a second conquest Uri Schwyz and Nidwalden gained the town of Bellinzona and the Riviera in 1500 Some of the land and the town Bellinzona itself were previously annexed by Uri in 1419 but lost again in 1422 The third conquest was fought by troops from the entire Confederation In 1512 Locarno the Maggia Valley Lugano and Mendrisio were annexed Subsequently the upper valley of the Ticino River from the St Gotthard to the town of Biasca was part of Canton Uri The remaining territory was administered by the Twelve Cantons

The lands of the canton of Ticino are the last lands to be conquered by the Swiss Confederation In February 1798 an attempt of annexation by the Cisalpine Republic was repelled by a volunteer militia in Lugano Between 1798 and 1803 during the Helvetic Republic the districts of Bellinzona and Lugano were separate cantons but in 1803 the two were unified to form the canton of Ticino that joined the Swiss Confederation as a full member in the same year During the Napoleonic Wars many Ticinese served in Swiss military units allied with the French

Until 1878 the three largest cities Bellinzona Lugano and Locarno alternated as capital of the canton In 1878 however Bellinzona became the only and permanent capital

The current constitution dates from 1997 The previous constitution heavily modified dates from 1830 nearly 20 years before the constitution of actual Swiss Confederation

The cantonal parliament is the Grand Council with 90 members and the government has 5 members In the both councils the members are elected with the proportional electoral system The canton sends two deputies to the Swiss Council of States and eight deputies to the National Council Its regional capitol is Bellinzona

The main agricultural production is wine mostly merlot a type of red wine It is followed by horticulture milk and cheese production

The hilly slopes of the canton are used extensively for the production of hydroelectricity The electricity produced is used at home and sold for export There is cattle breeding in the northern areas The production of wine is important in the canton and exported to mainly other areas in Switzerland The vineyards are mostly concentrated in the southern half of the canton where the climate is warmer Other agricultural produce includes corn potatoes tobacco and vegetables

The weather in the canton is often inverse to that north of the Alps This and a warmer climate in general attracts many tourists from other Swiss cantons The lakes together with the sunshine are considered attractive Tourism is the single most important economic factor in the canton

There is also light industry mostly concentrated around the three largest towns of Lugano Locarno and Bellinzona

The canton is well connected to the rest of Switzerland There are tunnels underneath the Gotthard massive both for rail and road The canton of Grisons is connected with a direct coach link whereas the canton of Valais is connected by rail through a tunnel at the Simplon Pass There are good rail links to Milan and Rome in Italy as well as Germany via Basel and Zrich

Because of the tourist trade there are a number of small railways in scenic areas in the mountains Winter sports is important despite being less developed

There are two major centres of education and research located in the canton of Ticino The University of Italian speaking Switzerland is the only Swiss university teaching in Italian The University of Applied Sciences of Italian speaking Switzerland on the other hand is a professional training college focused on a practical method of teaching in the areas of applied art economy social work technology and production science

Three daily newspapers are published in Ticino Corriere del Ticino La Regione and Giornale del Popolo These represent the only Italian daily publications in Switzerland

The official language and the one used for most written communication is Italian In oral communication Western Lombard varieties although receding in favour of Italian are still well preserved These are further subdivided into local variations with the northern valleys speaking a dialect more closely aligned with Romansch Switzerlands fourth official language There is a certain amount of popular literature in Ticinese and the national radio and televisions trasmit regularly program in Ticinese 

The population is mostly Roman Catholic or Protestant About 2 each are Orthodox or Muslim

The Canton of Ticino is divided into 8 districts and 38 circles

The Ticino river is a river that originates in the Alps near Nufenen It then flows through the Swiss canton of Ticino and northern Italy It flows into the river Po near Pavia It is 270 km long It gave its name to the canton In Switzerland it is dammed to make electricity In Italy it is mainly used for irrigation The river flows through Lago Maggiore

The Po is a river that flows 652 kilometers eastward across northern Italy from Monviso to the Adriatic Sea near Venice It has a drainage area of 71000 km and is the longest river in Italy 

It goes through many important Italian towns including Turin and Milan in Lombardy It is connected to Milan through a net of channels called navigli which Leonardo da Vinci helped design Near the end of its course it creates a wide delta at the southern part of which is Comacchio an area famous for eels The Po valley corresponds to the Roman Cisalpine Gaul divided in Cispadane Gaul and Transpadane Gaul

The vast valley around the Po is called Pianura Padana and is so efficiently connected by the river that the whole valley became the main industrial area of the country This river is subject to the authority of a special authority the Magistrato delle Acque

Roman poets sometimes referred to the Po river as Eridanus which also has other meanings

The main products of the farms around the river are cereals

In 2003 Cristiano Ronaldo joined Manchester United from Sporting Portugal He was given the number 7 This number had been worn by George Best Eric Cantona and David Beckham before him

In the 200708 season he became the only player in the last 25 years to win both the FIFPro Player of the Year and the FIFPro Young Player of the Year awards in the same season In that season he scored a total of 41 goals and won the European Golden Boot an award which is given to the top scorer 

Ronaldo is currently the most expensive professional football player of all time after moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid for approximately 80m He wears Nike Mercurial Vapors

Oaxaca is the name of one of the States in Mexico It is also the name of the capital of that state This article is about the state the city can be found at Oaxaca de Jurez Oaxaca is next to Guerrero Puebla Veracruz de Ignacio de la Llave and Chiapas About 35 million people live there The Zapotec and the Mixtec people live in the state There are more speakers of indigenous languages in this state than in any other state of Mexico

The Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany is the name of Germanys constitution It was written in 1949 when Germany was split into the countries of East Germany and West Germany Many parts of the constitution are very different from the constitution of the Weimar Republic

The writers decided not to call it the constitution because they hoped it would only be a temporary law for West Germany and that the two Germanys would soon be made into one

It was more than 40 years before East Germany and West Germany became one country again but the old name of Basic Law has been kept

The Federal Constiutional Court protects the constitution by banning laws which break the constitution There are some eternal clauses in the constitution which the court will protect even by banning constitutional amendments Article 1 about human life and article 20s basic principles are protected from change This is to make sure nothing like the Nazi period happens again The Nazis were able to pass an act which allowed Hitler to rule by decree

Germany is a federal parliamentary democracy To show this there are five constitutional institutions

The Federal President is the head of state It is largely ceremonial position with only a small role in daily politics The president does not have the massive power of the president of the Weimar Republic or the President of the United States He is the formal head of state and signs laws before they can enter into force and appoints federal officials he cannot decide when to dissolve the Bundestag or name a new chancellor until a majority of the members of the parliament vote in favour

The Chancellor is chosen by the Bundestag He or she is head of the executive branch and heads the federal Cabinet

The Judicial branch is made up of the Federal Constitutional Court and five other Supreme Courts There are also local and regional courts which make the first decision about cases Their decisions can be overturnned by the courts of appeal or Supreme Courts

The Federal Constitutional Court is the most important court in Germany Its job is to protect the Basic Law Its decisions are like laws The court can cancel laws if they break the Basic Law 

The Federal Social Court is the Supreme Court of Appeal for cases about social security pensions and health insurance

The Federal Labour Court is the Supreme Court of Appeal for cases about labour law This includes contracts of employment strikes and trade union agreements

The Federal Tax Court is the Supreme Court of Appeal for cases about tax and customs law

The Federal Social Court is the Supreme Court of Appeal for cases involving a government body These may be because a person might feel they have been treated unfairly by government or because there is a dispute between two government bodies about which of them is allowed to do something

This court is the Supreme Court of Appeal for cases all civil and criminal cases which are not heard by one of the other supreme courts

The legislative branch has two of the constitutional bodies

Germanys upper chamber of parliament the Bundesrat represents the Lnder It also shows that Germany is a federal state Federalism is one of the eternal clauses of the constitution that can never be changed

The Bundestag is the part of the legislature chosen by election The Chancellor must be a member of the Bundestag

The Weimar Constitution had the Reichswehr outside of the control of the parliament or the public The army directly reported to the president and the president did not have to report to the parliament 

Under the Basic Law the Defence Forces Bundeswehr are responsible to parliament because 

The chancellor is directly responsible to the parliament the minister is indirectly responsible to the parliament because it can remove the government by electing a new chancellor

The Basic Law also created a soldiers ombudsman or Wehrbeauftragter reporting to parliament not to the government Soldiers can write directly to the Wehrbeauftragter if they feel they have been treated unfairly or unlawfully or if they think their commanders are acting illegally Soldiers cannot be punished for writing to the Wehrbeauftragter

A number of Constitutional Court cases in the 1990s said that the Bundeswehr cannot be used by the government outside NATO territory unless the Bundestag first gives permission in a resolution The resultion must describe where the Bundeswehr is to go and for who long the mission will last

The Basic Law only allows referendums about changing borders of the Lnder There have been two referundums

Important changes to the Basic Law were the re introduction of conscription and the establishment of the Bundeswehr in 1956

During reunification East Germany and West Germany decided not to write a new constitution but to keep the old one which had worked so well in West Germany The constitution was amended to allow East Germany to join and then changed again to strengthen the claim that Germany wanted no more territory This was a promise made in the Final Settlement

Oaxaca de Jurez is the capital city of the Mexican state of Oaxaca It is called Laa in the Zapotec language uu Nunduva is its name in the Mixtec language Since 1872 when Benito Jurez died there the city is called de Jurez in his honour Currently 258000 people live in the city

Armadillos are small placental mammals known for having a bony armor shell The Dasypodidae are the only surviving family in the order Cingulata part of the superorder Xenarthra together with the anteaters and sloths The word armadillo is Spanish for little armored one 

There are approximately 10 extant genera and around 20 extant species of armadillo Their average length is about 75 centimeters including tail The Giant Armadillo grows up to 100 cm and weigh 30 kg All species live in the Americas

Niacin is a vitamin It is also known by the name nicotinic acid It is Vitamin B3 It can be dissolved in water It plays a very important role in the metabolism of living cells 

Other functions of niacin include removing toxic chemicals from the body and helping with the production of steroid hormones made by the adrenal gland These hormones include as sex hormones and stress related ones 

Niacin was first discovered from the oxidation of nicotine to form nicotinic acid When the properties of nicotinic acid were discovered it was thought prudent to choose a name to dissociate it from nicotine in order to avoid the perception that vitamins or niacin rich food contain nicotine The resulting name niacin was made from nicotinic acid vitamin 

Niacin is also referred to as Vitamin B3 because it was the third of the B vitamins to be discovered It has historically been referred to as vitamin PP That name was derived from the term pellagra preventing factor because the disease pellagra is due to a deficiency of niacin in the diet

The recommended daily allowance of niacin is 2 12 mg a day for children 14 mg a day for women 16 mg a day for men and 18 mg a day for pregnant or breast feeding women 

Severe deficiency of niacin in the diet causes the disease pellagra A mild deficiency will slow down the metabolism causing decreased tolerance to cold 

Dietary niacin deficiency tends to occur only in areas where people eat corn the only grain low in niacin as a staple food and that do not use lime during mealflour production Alkali lime releases the tryptophan from the corn in a process called nixtamalization so that it can be absorbed in the intestine and converted to niacin

Registration is a method of officially recording something Usually something is registered to claim more rights or to protect ownership or because the law says it must be registered to be used legally

A register was a large book It was used like a diary to record business dealings or other events

Births deaths and marriages are registered to prove the date the event happened In the United Kingdom these records are kept by the local registrar who is in charge of the Register office 

Motor Vehicles are registered to prove who owns the vehicle Cars or vans that not registered cannot be driven on roads Aircraft not registered cannot be flown Proof that a vehicle is registered is the number plate or licence plate Vehicles must also be registered before they can be insured in case of an accident or in case of theft

Books might be registered to show the date when copyright protection starts Usually this is done by sending a copy of the book to a special national library

People who stay in a hotel register their names and addresses when they arrive The hotel can then workout how much the people most pay for their stay The local police may also keep a copy of these names to help fight crime

Tropical Storm Arlene was the first named storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Arlene was a large storm that formed early in the year It had maximum wind speeds of 70 mph It also caused one death and created 118 million in damage

The storm formed near Honduras on June 8 and moved north It came close to western Cuba on June 10 before entering the Gulf of Mexico Arlene strengthened just below hurricane strength before making landfall on western Florida The storm quickly weakened while moving inland and later became an extratropical remnant on June 13

When Tropical Storm Arlene formed on June 8 it was the ninth time that the name has been used to name a storm in the Atlantic This meant Arlene kept its position as the most commonly used name for Atlantic storms But because the storm did not cause any major damages its name was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization and will be on the list of names for the 2011 season

Chip Douglas is an American musician and songwriter He became a producer when he worked with The Monkees on their music He also worked with The Turtles first as bass guitarist and arranger then later as producer

Sir Henry Wood was an English conductor He is famous for having been the conductor of the Proms He conducted the Proms for 50 years They became known as the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts Today they are called the BBC Proms

Henry Wood was born in London His father was an optician but had become well known for making model trains He sold them in his shop in Oxford Street in London His parents liked music They both sang and his father played the cello

Although Henry heard a lot of music around him he did not have proper music lessons until he was already quite old When he was 14 he learned to play the organ He also played the piano and violin When he was 16 he went to the Royal Academy of Music where he had lessons in piano organ composition and singing He wanted to become a singing teacher and he did in fact give singing lessons all his life He became good at the piano so that he could accompany singers

When he left the Royal Academy of Music he found work as a singing teacher and as a conductor of choirs and orchestras He wrote a small book called The Gentle Art of Singing

In 1893 a man called Robert Newman who was manager of the Queens Hall had an idea He wanted to organize a series of concerts in which the audience could walk about and listen to music He wanted to call them Promenade Concerts There were already promenade concerts in the parks in London but those Promenade concerts were just for music that was easy to listen to Newman wanted people to get to know good classical music He wanted the tickets to be cheap so that people who were not rich would be able to afford to go Newman thought that Henry Wood was a good conductor and asked him to conduct these concerts

The first series of Promenade Concerts was in 1895 The programmes were much longer than they are in concerts today There were lots of short pieces of music Wood gradually made his audiences get used to listening to longer pieces of music He introduced them to new music which had only recently been written He conducted music by many British composers and European composers People at that time were very prejudiced They thought that only German conductors knew how to conduct German composers such as Richard Wagner Wood showed them that he could do it too He conducted every night during the Proms season On Mondays he played a lot of Wagner and on Fridays he played Beethoven He played music by European composers whose music was not yet well known in England eg Sibelius Schoenberg and many Russian composers

Wood conducted the Proms until his death in 1944 Most of that time he was the only conductor of the Proms Later in life he shared the conducting with other conductors such as Basil Cameron and Sir Adrian Boult Wood had a big influence on the standard of music making in England He made orchestral playing better making sure that the players did not send in deputies instead of them He made sure that the orchestral players were paid well and he allowed women to play in the orchestra

Wood is mainly remembered for the promenade concerts but he conducted many other groups as well He travelled around England conducting at music festivals He often conducted amateur groups He made sure that he knew the music he was conducting very well Many conductors in the 19th century did not do this They were more keen to show off but Wood prepared the music carefully marking things in his score with coloured pencils

Wood made arrangements of other composers music eg Bachs Toccata and Fugue in D minor for organ He arranged a group of songs called Fantasia on British Sea Songs for the 1905 centenary celebrations of the Battle of Trafalgar These are always played at the Last Night of the Proms 

In 1938 he conducted a jubilee concert in the Royal Albert Hall Rachmaninov was the soloist and Vaughan Williams wrote his Serenade to Music for orchestra and sixteen soloists Wood often worked too hard and it was not good for his health He died on 19 August 1944 just over a week after the fiftieth anniversary concert of the Proms which he had been too ill even to listen to on the radio 

Wood was given many honours he was knighted by the king in 1911 he was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1921 and was made a Companion of Honour in 1944 At the Proms today his bust is put at the front of the Royal Albert Hall during the whole of each Prom season At the Last Night of the Proms it is decorated by a chaplet

In computer networks a proxy server is a server which clients use to access other computers A proxy server that passes information to its clients without changing it is usually called a gateway or sometimes tunneling proxy

A client that connects to the proxy server requests some service such as a file connection web page or other resource that is available on a different server The proxy server then goes to the other server and requests what the client wants for them

A proxy server can change the information that it gives to the client and if the same information is accessed many times or by many different clients it can use what is called a cache to make things faster A cache is the term for information that has been accessed and saved for future use if a proxy server has what the client is accessing in its cache it will make it faster because it does not need to go and access the other server to provide what the client wants

Proxy servers get their name because they act like a proxy of the server computer

A proxy server can be placed anywhere in the connection between the client and the server which could include software on the client computer itself or on any computer between

Some proxy servers use Secure Sockets Layer to secure the connection between the client and the remote server This security layer helps to make sure that no other computers can read or understand what the client is asking from the server

There are many benefits of using a proxy server First the client machine can exchange data with the remote server without making a direct connection This way the clients real internet address will not be known to the remote server This is sometimes called anonymizing because it makes the client anonymous A second advantage is that when the proxy server itself is able to serve the request made by the client it will not contact the remote server any more So the load on the remote server will be reduced by using a proxy server This type of proxy servers are called caching servers

Big organizations sometimes use proxy servers to control access to the Internet A large bank may use a proxy server that only allows connections to other websites relevant to banking The proxy server might however block access to Websites offering free email or serving pornographic material It might also block access to file sharing applications Limiting access to specific content on the internet is also called internet filtering

A proxy server may have one or more of the functions described below

A caching proxy server can service requests from clients without contacting the remote server instead it sends the data which it has stored from a previous request This is called caching

Caching proxy servers reduce the work load of the remote server However they have their own problems especially if they are not configured well Some problems are described in RFC 3143

A web proxy is a proxy server that focuses on the traffic over the World Wide Web It may be used to block offensive web content or to control access of clients to online content They may be used by corporations or countries

Web proxies can also be used to track how different individuals have used internet access

An anonymizing proxy server removes identifying information from the clients requests for the purpose of anonymity They may also be used to break through filtered contents on the internet

A proxy server is called an open proxy if everyone can connect to it and use it Usually open proxies are proxy servers which are badly configured Open proxies may be abused easily for example a bad user may send a corrupting request to a remote server but hide himself behind an open proxy so the administrators of the remote server cannot stop him Open proxies can also be used for spamming For this reason some websites do not allow connections to their web servers through known open proxies

A forced proxy server is a proxy server which handles all of the traffic from the client to the internet The client will not know that the proxy exists but all of the information passes through the proxy server They are sometimes called transparent proxy servers because the user does not know a proxy server is between the client and remote server

There is a lot of software which can be used for running a proxy server Some software can only work as a proxy server while other software can also work as a firewall or caching server Squid Varnish and Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server are among the best known pieces of proxy server software Some proxy software uses the SOCKS protocol An example is the Java SOCKS Proxy Server

In net jargon a client is a computer used by a user to connect to a network and make requests to servers For example a web browser is a client software

Caching is a term used in computer science A cache uses two media one that is slow to access and the other that is fast The very basic idea behind caching is to use the medium that is fast to access to have copies of data Accessing the original data may take a long time or it may be expensive to do For this reason it is much cheaper to simply use the copy of the data from the cache Put differently a cache is a temporary storage area that has copies of data that is used often When a copy of the data is in this cache it is faster to use this copy rather than re fetching or re calculating the original data This will make the average time needed to access the data shorter 

A buffer is very similar to a cache It is different in that the client accessing the data in a buffer knows there is a buffer the buffer is managed by the application With a cache the client accessing the data need not be aware there is a cache

Typical computer applications access data in very similar ways Suppose the data is structured into blocks which can be accessed individually When an application accesses a block it is also very likely to access a block that is close to the original block This is known as locality of reference There are different kinds of such locality Locality of reference is one of the reasons why caches work well in many areas of computing 

In order to work well caches are small compared to the whole amount of data The bigger the cache the longer it takes to lookup an entry Bigger caches are also more expensive to build

A cache is a block of memory for storing data which is likely used again The CPU and hard drive often use a cache as do web browsers and web servers 

A cache is made up of many entries called a pool Each entry holds a datum which is a copy of a datum in another place Caches usually use what is called a backing store Backing stores are slow or expensive to access compared to the cache A disk cache uses a hard disk as a backing store for example Each entry also has a little information attached called a tag This tag is used to find the location where the original data is stored 

A client wants to access a bit of data it believes to be in the backing store it first checks to see if the datum can be found in the cache If the data can be found in the cache the client can use it and does not need to use the main memory This is known as a cache hit So for example a web browser program might check its local cache on disk to see if it has a local copy of the contents of a web page at a particular URL In this example the URL is the tag and the contents of the web page is the datum

The other situation that can occur is that the datum with the tag cannot be found in the cache This is known as cache miss The datum needs to be fetched from the backing store Usually it is copied into the cache so that the next time it no longer needs to be fetched from the backing store

The cache only has a limited size To make room for the previously uncached entry another cached entry may need to be deleted from the cache Special rules are used to find the entry that should best be deleted These rules are usually called Heuristics Heuristics used to find the entry are called replacement policy A very simple rule used is called Least recently used It simply takes the entry that was used the longest time ago Other heuristics are listed at cache algorithm

Caches can also be used for writing data the benefit of this is that the client can continue its operation once the entry has been written to the cache it does not have to wait until the entry is written to the backing store 

However the entry must be written to the backing store at some point in time The timing when this happens is controlled by the write policy

In a write through cache each entry is written to the backing store immediately as well as being stored in cache 

The other option is to only write to cache and write to the backing store later This is known as write back cache The cache marks the entries that have not yet been written to the backing store the mark that is used is often referred to as dirty flag Before the entries are deleted from the cache they are written to the backing store This is known as lazy write A miss in a write back cache will often need two memory accesses one to get the needed datum and another to write replaced data from the cache to the store

The caching policy may also say that a certain datum must be written to cache The client may have made many changes to the datum in the cache After it is done it may explicitly tell the cache to write back the datum 

No write allocation is a cache policy where only reads are cached This avoids the need for write back or write through caching Writes are done to the backing store all the time 

The client is not the application that changes data in the backing store If the data changed in the backing store the copy in the cache will be out of date or stale Alternatively when the client updates the data in the cache copies of that data in other caches will become stale There are special communication protocols that allow cache managers to talk to each other to keep the data meaningful These are known as coherency protocols

The word cache was first used in the context of computing in 1967 when an scientific article was prepared to be published in IBM Systems Journal The article was about a new improvement of the memory in Model 85 Model 85 was a computer of the IBM System360 product line The editor of the Journal wanted a better word for high speed buffer used in the article He got no input and suggested cache from the French cacher meaning to hide The article was published in early 1968 and the authors were honored by IBM Their work was widely welcomed and improvedCache soon became standard usage in computer literature

Small memories on or close to the CPU chip can be made faster than the much larger main memory Most CPUs since the 1980s have used one or more caches Modern general purpose CPUs inside personal computers may have as many as half a dozen Each cache may be specialised to a different part of the task of executing programs

CPU caches are generally managed entirely by hardware other caches are managed by a different kinds of software The operating system usually manages a page cache in main memory Users outside computer science usually call this cache virtual memory It is managed by the kernel of the operating system 

Modern hard drives have disk buffers These are sometimes called disk cache but this is wrong The main function of these buffers is to order disk writes and to manage reads Repeated cache hits are rare because the buffer is very small compared to the size of the hard drive 

Local hard disks are fast compared to other storage devices such as remote servers local tape drives or optical jukeboxes Using local hard disks as caches is the main concept of hierarchical storage management

Web browsers and web proxy servers use caches to store previous responses from web servers such as web pages Web caches reduce the amount of information that needs to be transmitted over the network Information previously stored in the cache can often be re used This reduces bandwidth and processing requirements of the web server and helps to improve responsiveness for users of the web

Modern web browsers use a built in web cache but some internet service providers or organizations also use a caching proxy server This is a web cache that is shared between all users of that network

Search engines also often make web pages they have indexed available from their cache For example Google provides a Cached link next to each search result This is useful when web pages are temporarily inaccessible from a web server

Write through operation is common in unreliable networks The protocol used to make sure the data in the write cache makes sense when several write caches are used is very complex in such a case

For instance web page caches and client side network file system caches are typically read only or write through to keep the network protocol simple and reliable

Buffer and cache are not mutually exclusive they are also often used together The reason why they are used is different though A buffer is a location in memory that is traditionally used because CPU instructions cannot directly address data stored in peripheral devices Computer memory is used as an intermediate store 

Additionally such a buffer may be feasible when a large block of data is assembled or disassembled or when data may be delivered in a different order than that in which it is produced Also a whole buffer of data is usually transferred sequentially so buffering itself sometimes increases transfer performance These benefits are present even if the buffered data are written to the buffer once and read from the buffer once

A cache also increases transfer performance A part of the increase similarly comes from the possibility that multiple small transfers will combine into one large block But the main performance gain occurs because there is a good chance that the same datum will be read from cache several times or that written data will soon be read The only purpose of Caches is to reduce accesses to the underlying slower storage Cache is also usually an abstraction layer that is designed to be invisible from the perspective of neighboring layers That way the applications or clients may not be aware that there is a cache

Hydroxide in chemistry is a name given to the diatomic anion OH made up of oxygen and hydrogen atoms Most chemical compounds that contain hydroxides are bases

An Arrhenius base is a substance that when dissolved in an aqueous solution it produces hydroxide ions Therefore hydroxide ions are heavily involved in acid base reactions

Many useful chemical reactions or processes involve hydroxide or hydroxide ions Sodium hydroxide is used in industry as a strong base potassium hydroxide is used in agriculture and iron hydroxide minerals such as goethite and limonite have been used as iron ore The aluminium ore bauxite is made mainly out of aluminium hydroxides

Most inorganic hydroxide salts do not dissolve in water

Many useful chemicals and chemical processes involve hydroxides or hydroxide ions Sodium hydroxide is used in factories as an alkali potassium hydroxide is used in farming and iron hydroxide have been used as low grade brown iron ore 

Cyclone in meteorology refers to any low pressure area with winds spiraling inwards Cyclones rotate clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere and anti clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere Cyclone is the general term for a variety of low pressure system types such as tropical cyclones extra tropical cyclones and tornadoes

The largest of the low pressure systems are the extratropical cyclones and the cold core polar cyclones which lie on the synoptic scale which in meteorology is a horizontal length of 1000 km or more The Warm core cyclones are the tropical cyclones mesocyclones and the polar lows that lie within the smaller mesoscale The Subtropical cyclones are intermediate in size Cyclones have also been on other planets outside of the Earth such as Mars and Neptune For example the Great Red Spot of Jupiter and the Great Black Spot of Neptune

Cyclones are also referred to as hurricanes and typhoons They consist of the eye eyewall and rainbands

The process of cyclone formation and intensification is described as Cyclogenesis The formation of Extratropical cyclones comes as waves in large regions of enhanced midlatitude temperature contrasts which are called baroclinic zones These zones contract to form weather fronts as the circulation of the cyclone closes and gets more intense Later in their life cycle cyclones form what is called an occluded front The cyclones track is then guided over the course of an 2 to 6 day life cycle by its steering flow of the polar or subtropical jetstream

The eye is an area of calm weather in the center of strong tropical cyclones The cyclones lowest barometric pressure occurs in the eye It is usually circular and range between 30 and 65 km in diameter though smaller and larger eyes can occur

The region surrounding the eye is the eyewall where the worst weather is seen in a cyclone These have strong winds lots of rain and lots of cloud There are also outer bands which surround the cyclone which forms the greatest part of the storm These have winds so strong they can even form other tornadoes

Glasgow Coma Scale or GCS is a scale that is used to measure the consciousness of a person It was invented in 1974 by Graham Teasdale and Bryan J Jennett professors of neurosurgery at the University of Glasgow

GCS is used in evaluation of patients especially in ICUs This scale consists of three tests which are described below A score is given for each test and the GCS score is calculated by adding the scores given to each test The maximum score is 15 which means the patient is fully conscious The minimum score is 3 and is usually seen in patients with brain death or those in deep coma

The scale comprises three tests eye verbal and motor responses

There are 4 grades for this test

There are 5 grades for this test

The Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the highest legislative body in the United Kingdom and British overseas territories It alone has parliamentary sovereignty over all other political bodies At its head is the Sovereign Queen Elizabeth II

The parliament has an upper house the House of Lords and a lower house the House of Commons The Queen is the third part of Parliament

Parliament developed from the early medieval councils of bishops and earls that advised the sovereigns of England 

In the Middle Ages and early modern period there were three kingdoms within the British Isles England Scotland and Ireland and these developed separate parliaments The 1707 Acts of Union brought England and Scotland together under the Parliament of Great Britain and the 1800 Act of Union included Ireland under the Parliament of the United Kingdom

The English Parliament has its origins in the Anglo Saxon Witenagemot In 1066 William of Normandy brought a feudal system where he sought the advice of a council before making laws In 1215 this council got the Magna Carta from King John which established that the king may not levy or collect any taxes save with the consent of his royal council which slowly developed into a parliament

In 1265 Simon de Montfort 6th Earl of Leicester called the first elected Parliament The Laws in Wales Acts of 153542 annexed Wales as part of England and brought Welsh representatives to Parliament

When Elizabeth I was succeeded in 1603 by the Scottish King James VI of Scotland the countries both came under his rule but each retained its own Parliament 

In the Scotland in the High Middle Ages the Kings Council of Bishops and Earls was the beginning of the Parliament of 1235

The Irish Parliament was founded to represent the English community in the Lordship of Ireland but the native or Gaelic Irish were not allowed to vote or stand for office the first known meeting being in 1264 In 1541 Henry VIII declared the Kingdom of Ireland The Gaelic Irish lords were now entitled to attend the Irish Parliament as equals of the majority of English descent 

Silicon dioxide also known as silica is a chemical compound the oxide of silicon Its chemical symbol is SiO2 It is known for its hardness since the 16th century It is an important compound used in most types of glass and other hard substances such as concrete porcelain and stoneware

Silicon dioxide exists in nature in a number of forms including flint quartz and opal If it is breathed in as dust it can cause silicosis and cancer as the dust is trapped in the lungs Besides the dangers of inhaling it in dust form it is harmless

Metallic hydrogen is an alkali metal made from hydrogen gas This is formed when the hydrogen gas is under compression and results with the gas changing phase It is an example of degenerate matter The matter has a crystal structure of proton atoms with spacing that is extremely small smaller than a Bohr radius The electrons in the molecular orbital are unbounded and they behave like the conduction electrons in a metal Metallic hydrogen is unusual as the element itself is not an alkali metal but a diatomic gas

Metallic hydrogen is known to exist in the cores of Jupiter and Saturn Jupiter has the most metallic hydrogen

Giovanni Domenico Cassini also known as Jean Dominique Cassini was an Italian French astronomer engineer and astrologer Cassini was born in Perinaldo in the Republic of Genoa 

Cassini along with Robert Hooke discovered the Great Red Spot on Jupiter in around 1665 He also discovered the four of Saturns moons as well as the Cassini Division in Saturns rings

Christiaan Huygens was a Dutch physicist mathematician and astronomer born in The Hague He was noted for his arguments that light was in the form of waves He discovered Saturns largest moon Titan in 1655 He also did detailed studies on Saturns rings and in 1656 he discovered that they are made up of rocks He worked on the making of accurate clocks and invented the pendulum clock on Christmas 1656

Hyperion is a moon of Saturn It was discovered on September 16 1848 by William Cranch Bond George Phillips Bond and William Lassell It is irregular in shape and has a sponge like appearance It is the second largest irregular moon in the Solar System the largest being Proteus Its rotation is chaotic meaning its axis of rotation wobbles unlike how the Earth and the Moon rotate or any other moon in the Solar System

Iapetus is a large moon of Saturn It was discovered by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1671 Iapetus is unusual in that one side is very bright and the other side is very dark This is because one half of the moon is covered in ice and the other side is coated in black dusty carbon deposits When Cassini observed the moon he could only see the moon on one side of Saturn He concluded that the moon is darker on side than the other later confirmed by the Voyager 1 spacecraft Iapetus also has an equatorial ridge discovered by the Cassini Huygens spacecraft on December 31 2004 Iapetus has a very slow rotation rate taking 79 Earth days to complete a rotation

Nadezhda Yakovlevna Mandelstam was born Nadezhda Yakovlevna Hazin in Saratov on 31 October 1899 and died on 29 December 1980 was a Russian writer and the wife of poet Osip Mandelstam

Osip Mandelstam was released but arrested again in 1938 Before the government could decide where to send him he died in a camp near Vladivostok 

After this Nadezhda Mandelstam never lived in the same place for long and she often changed jobs She did this to hide from the NKVD When she was living in Kalinin the police came to arrest her her but she had moved to a new house the day before

She decided to spend her life collecting and publishing all of her husbands poems and most of the poems she learned by heart 

After Stalin died Nadezhda Mandelstam published he book and was allowed to return to Moscow in 1958

In 1979 she gave her archives to Princeton University in the United States of America  Nadezhda Mandelstam died in 1980 in Moscow aged 81

The Bundesrat is part of the parliament of Germany

The cabinets of the 16 states of Germany appoint the delegations that represent them in the Bundesrat They can remove them at any time Normally a state delegation is headed by the head of government The delegation is made up of members of the state government

Thirteen of the states of Germany have a Minister Prsident the other 3 are city states which have a Mayor These prime ministers or mayors each act as chairman of the Bundesrat for one year at a time

Germany does not have a vice president Instead if the Bundesprsident cannot do his job the President of the Bundesrat can act in his place if necessary

Although it is a part of the German Parliament the Bundesrat does not meet in the same building as the Bundestag Instead new offices and a modern meeting chamber were built inside the old Prussian House of Lords building

ImageBundesratjpgthumbThe old Prussian House of Lords building

There are 69 members of the Bundesrat How many delegates a land has depends on its population The smallest state Bremen has three members North Rhine Westphalia is the most populous land It sends six members to the Bundesrat

The Bundestag decides most things by absolute majority That is 35 votes Some important decisions need two thirds of all of the possible votes That is 46 votes

Each land votes as a block This means that Berlin for example can only cast four yes votes or four no votes Its delegates cannot choose to vote in different ways If a land decided to send only one person to the Bundesrat that person would still have all of the lands votes Usually the Minister President casts all of his lands votes even if the other members are there

If a land has a coalition government then all parties must agree how to vote in the Bundesrat In 2002 Brandenburg did not agree how to vote about the Immigration bill The Federal Constitutional Court said that the bill was not law because Brandenburgs vote could not be included in the total This meant that the bill did not get a majority in the Bundesrat

A minister president is the head of government in a number of European countries or subnational governments who presides over the council of ministers The title is similar to Prime Minister First Minister and President of the Council

The German word means president of the ministers therefor Ministers President would be a more accurate translation 

This person is the equivalent of a state premier in Australia a provincial prime minister in Canada or the Governor of a state in the USA

Each year one of the ministers president or one of the senior Mayors of the city states of Berlin Hamburg and Bremen is the President of the Bundesrat Because Germany does not have a vice president The President of the Bundesrat will act as the Federal President if the Federal President dies or is out of the country

The Royal Albert Hall of Arts and Sciences usually just called the Royal Albert Hall is a very big building in the City of Westminster London England It was opened in 1871 by Queen Victoria and was called after her husband Albert Prince Consort who had died ten years earlier

The Royal Albert Hall is one of the most famous buildings in the world Lots of different things happen in the Royal Albert Hall concerts for classical music or pop music ballet even tennis or boxing matches or large ceremonies or parties or conferences In the summer the BBC Proms take place there every day

In the early 19th century the whole area was still countryside In 1851 there was a Great Exhibition in Hyde Park just next to Kensington Park opposite where the RAH now stands The exhibition building called Crystal Palace was a glass building which was just there for the exhibition Prince Albert had the idea that public buildings should be built in the area for the arts and sciences Some huge museums were built including the Science Museum Natural History Museum Victoria and Albert Museum etc When Prince Albert died in 1861 this plan had only just got started The Royal Albert Hall was built and named after him Queen Victoria laid the first stone

The Royal Albert Hall is very large As many as 9000 people used to get in but now the safety rules make about 5500 the usual number It is round like an Ancient Greek or Roman amphitheatre This is why the floor area is called the arena There is a very large glass and wrought iron dome It is 41m high Round the outside a little lower than the roof there is a big mosaic frieze with pictures of The Triumph of Arts and Sciences and some writing in terracotta letters It says that the first stone was laid by Her Majesty Queen Victoria on 20 May 1867 and was opened by her on 29 March 1871 It also has some words from the Bible When Queen Victoria opened the building she was so emotional that she could not speak Her son Edward the Prince of Wales had to say her words for her He said The Queen declares this Hall is now open

The hall has been used for lots of important events ever since 1871 Many of the seats are still owned by members of a Corporation which was called the Corporation of the Hall of Arts and Sciences This group had been formed in 1866 as a charity to get money to build the hall Its members still have a right to occupy 1300 of the 5200 seats

There was a problem with the sound because there was too much echo It was not until 1969 that something was done about it Big fibreglass dishes were hung from the ceiling People who go to the RAH today call them mushrooms or sometimes flying saucers They make music sound much better

There is a very large organ at the front of the hall It was built by an organ maker called Henry Willis and was later rebuilt by Harrison Harrison and most recently by Mander Organs It is the biggest organ in the British Isles with 9997 pipes

The Promenade Concerts which were started by Henry Wood in 1895 have taken place in the RAH ever since 1941 when the Queens Hall was destroyed by bombs in World War II For two months there is at least one concert every day and people can be seen queuing for standing tickets all the way down the steps towards Prince Consort Road

People who go to the proms today can choose between standing in the arena or sitting in the stalls or sitting in the Loggia Boxes Second Tier Boxes Circle Choir or standing in the gallery For some events such as tennis matches or ballets or operas the action takes place in the arena so audience do not sit or stand there

During the last few years a lot of money has been spent on improving the Royal Albert Hall The 1800 seats in the balcony were very uncomfortable so new seats were put in which are slightly bigger The south entrance has been made into the main entrance with a porch to match the north entrance The area south of the hall has been blocked off to traffic and pedestrianised Dressing rooms are now on stage level instead of down in a basement There is an underground car park and loading area so that lorries bringing things do not need to unload in the street and get in the way of the people Lots of other improvements have been made including better ventilation

School colors are the colors representing the school of which one goes to

School colors are often found in pairs and rarely no more than trios though some professional teams use up to four colors in a set The choice of colors usually follows the rule of tincture from heraldry but exceptions to this rule are known

Common primary colors include orange purple blue red and green These colors are either paired with a color representing a metal or occasionally each other such as orangeblue redgreen or blueyellow Pairing two metals such as blackwhite silvergold and especially blackgold is also a common practice  Finally some American schools in a display of patriotism adopt the national colors of redwhiteblue

In an effort to further establish identity and promote a standard many institutions often decree the use of specific shades of colors Maroon generally regarded as a darker shade of red is a common primary color Various shades of blue from powder to Prussian are also in use a few schools have adopted two different shades of blue for their colors with the darker shade serving as the primary The shade of gold can vary greatly even within an institution from a vivid yellow to a more convincing old gold

Black white and gray are often used as neutral colors for sets that do not otherwise adopt them This practice is especially notable in basketball and professional baseball

Most competitive teams keep two sets of uniforms with one design emphasizing the primary color and the other emphasizing the secondary color In some sports such as football the primary color is emphasized on home uniforms while uniforms for other sports notably basketball use the secondary or a neutral color at home This is done to avoid confusion when playing a team with similar colors

In addition various groups that generate support for athletic teams including cheerleaders and marching bands wear uniforms with the colors of their school

At many private schools school colours are awards presented for achievement in a subject or a sport  See Sporting Colours

The Hebrew Calendar is the calendar used in Judaism

It sets the dates of the Jewish holidays the right Torah portions for public reading Yahrzeits and the specific daily Psalms which some customarily read 

Two major forms of the calendar have been used an observational form used before the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE and based on witnesses observing the phase of the moon and a rule based form first fully described by Maimonides in 1178 CE which was adopted over a transition period between 70 and 1178

The modern form is a fixed arithmetic lunisolar calendar Because of the roughly 11 day difference between twelve lunar months and one solar year the calendar repeats in a 19 year cycle of 235 lunar months with an extra lunar month added once every two or three years for a total of 7 times per 19 years As the Hebrew calendar was developed in the region east of the Mediterranean Sea references to seasons reflect the times and climate of the Northern Hemisphere

Jews have been using a lunisolar calendar since Biblical times The first commandment the Jewish People received as a nation was the commandment to determine the New Moon The beginning of Exodus Chapter 12 says This month is for you the first of months The months were originally referred to in the Bible by number rather than name Only four pre exilic month names appear in the Tanakh Aviv Ziv Ethanim and Bul and all are Canaanite names

The Smothers Brothers are an American folk music comedy duo made up of real life brothers Tom and Dick Smothers They were at their most popular during the 1960s and 1970s Tom plays acoustic guitar and Dick plays upright bass and both men sing They pretend to get into arguments about the songs and this forms much of their comedy act

The Smothers Brothers began their career during the folk music boom in the United States during the late 1950s and early 1960s Their comedy got them noticed and they began to make records and appear on television Later they starred in their own television series The Smothers Brothers Show They did not sing or perform music on this show but instead Dick played a man whose broken wikt linkdeceasedeceased brother became his broken wikt linkguardian angelguardian angel

Their next series The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour was a variety show with live performances by musical guests and sometimes actors and comedians The brothers hosted the show which began in 1967 They would begin with a song in their usual style and introduce the performers Along with guests the show had regular actors and writers These included Steve Martin Pat Paulsen Bob Einstein Mason Williams Leigh French and Lorenzo Music

Some of the guests who appeared on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour were Bette Davis Tony Randall Kate Smith Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor and Inger Stevens Some of their musical guests were Pete Seeger The Turtles Janis Ian Jefferson Airplane Nancy Sinatra The First Edition Donovan Peter Paul and Mary Joan Baez Jennifer Warnes and The Buckinghams Glen Campbell regularly appeared on the show and hosted a summer replacement series The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour

Sometimes the performances had controversial topics like the Vietnam War population and many social issues CBS who broadcast the show sometimes censored it taking parts out that a large number of people might disagree with They warned the brothers about presenting things that might cause upset to viewers The Smotherses and their staff though believed it was important to comment about such things The issues mattered to them and were affecting people around the United States and the world

In 1969 CBS cancelled the show even though they had already promised another season of shows would be made The reason given was that David Steinberg a comedian whose style included broken wikt linkdouble entendredouble entendre had been invited back to appear even though CBS had broken wikt linkvetovetoed his reappearance The two sides went to court

In 1973 the court decided CBS had violated their contract with the Smothers Brothers and that the real reason they had cancelled the show was out of censorship CBS had to pay the Smotherses for the never made season The reputation of the brothers though had suffered

The Smothers Brothers tried to produce a new show this time for the ABC television network but it did not last long Times had changed and viewers were now interested in other shows and performers

The brothers went back to appearing live in small clubs and large venues as the chances came One night in 1974 they were appearing in the Troubadour Club in Los Angeles California Two members of the audience were Harry Nilsson and John Lennon who both knew the Smothers Brothers offstage As it turned out Nilsson and Lennon were drunk and began to broken wikt linkheckleheckle the brothers thinking it would help the show It did not and Nilsson and Lennon were finally escorted out

The Smothers Brothers remained popular with many fans and continued to perform their act as years went by They appeared on programs like The Tonight Show during the 1970s and 1980s A television special in 1988 reunited many of the Comedy Hour cast members and another short lived series was produced CBS aired the new programs having long ago made peace with the Smotherses

In later years the Smothers Brothers appeared in Las Vegas and Branson Missouri still performing their familiar act They continue to tour more than fifty years after their careers began often backed by local symphony orchestras

Many filmmakers worldwide including Americans Woody Allen and Robert Altman the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky and the Japanese director Akira Kurosawa have cited the work of Bergman as a major influence on their workfactdateJuly 2007

Ernst Ingmar Bergman was born in Uppsala Sweden to a Lutheran minister of Danish descent Erik Bergman and his wife Karin He grew up surrounded by religious imagery and discussion His father was a rather conservative parish minister and strict family father Ingmar was locked up in dark closets for infractions such as wetting the bed While father preached away in the pulpit and the congregation prayed sang or listened Ingmar writes in his biography Laterna Magica

He performed two five month stretches of mandatory military service and studied Art and Literature at Stockholm University College but without graduating Instead he developed an interest in theatre and later in cinema 

Although he grew up in a devout Lutheran household Bergman stated that he lost his faith at age eight but came to terms with this fact only when making Winter Light

Since the early sixties Bergman lived much of his life on the island of Fr Gotland Sweden where he made a number of his movies Bergman moved to Munich for a while following a protracted battle with the Swedish government over alleged tax evasion and did not return to make another movie in Sweden until 1982 when he directed Fanny and Alexander Bergman said this would be his last movie and that he would go on to direct theater Since that time he did make a number of movies for television but later retired to Fr stating in 2004 that he would never again leave the island

Ingmar Bergman died peacefully at his home on Fr in the early morning of 30 July 2007 age 89 the same day that another great film director Michelangelo Antonioni died

Baryonyx was a carnivorous dinosaur discovered in clay pits just south of Dorking England and also in northern Spain It has been dated to the Barremian period of Early Cretaceous Period around 125 million years ago

It was first discovered in 1983 by William Walker who was an English amateur fossil hunter A group of scientists lead by Alan J Charig and Angela C Milner of the Natural History Museum examined the skeleton and named Baryonyx walkeri after the man who discovered it Other good skeletons were discovered in England and in Spain which gave scientists a good idea of what the dinosaur was like

Baryonyx probably grew up to 85 meters long with claws which were up to 35 centimeters long It ate fish like a grizzely bear would

Heat capacity is a measure of how much materials can store up heat as they change temperature

Materials with high heat capacities require a lot of heat to be stored up before a small change in temperature can be measured Materials with low heat capacities require very little heat to be stored up before a large change in temperature can be measured

The heat capacity of a single material is called the specific heat capacity of the material The term heat capacity by itself means the general idea

Specific heat capacities are often listed in tables like this one 

Pope John I was the leader pope of the early Christian community Pope John the first was born in Populonia Tuscany Italy He was the son of emperor Constantius He became the pope on Marys Day on 13 August 523 Its not certain if he died directly from thirst and starvation but his imprisonment and bad inhumane treatment certainly contributed to his demise The Pope died at 1122PM on 18 May 526 His name means God is gracious the gift of God 

He ended the Acacian Schism thus after 25 years bringing important reunification of the Eastern and Western churches into one by restoring peace between the papacy and the Byzantine emperor Justin I Pope also set the rules for the Alexandrian calendar computation of the date of Easter which was eventually accepted throughout the West 

Pope John the Firsts official day used to be on 26 May but only for a short time then it was moved to 27 May His holy day was moved again at the end of the 20th century to the more appropriate day his birthday His motto was Unity is the Key

Bad Godesberg is a district of the city of Bonn in southern North Rhine Westphalia Germany From 1949 till 1999 Bonn was the capital of West Germany and the majority of foreign embassies to Germany were located in Bad Godesberg Some buildings are still used as embassy branch offices or consulates

The town is twinned with

A consulate is a small official office of a country in another The main office is called an Embassy and is in the capital city Consulates are in other large towns and usually do not do all of the jobs of the embassy 

Consulates usually deal with questions about passports for their own citizens visas for foreigners wanting to visit the consulates home country and licences for import and export

Some larger and more important countries might also have Consulates General These are simply bigger consulates which might do more than a smaller consulate

People who work in any sort of consulates are called consular officers The person in charge is called a consul or consul general An honorary consul does not work full time for the government They are usually in port towns to speed up issuing documents for trade An honorary consul might be a citizen of the country he works for or have another link such as parents or grandparents or they may have married someone from there They usually work in an office use their office as the honorary consulate

Consular officers have diplomatic immunity

Diplomatic immunity is a special law that covers people who work in embassies or consulates The people are called a diplomats The diplomatic immunity means that although they live and work as a visitor inside a host country they are not ruled by the law of that country They are only ruled by the law of their home country 

A diplomat can work without interference from the police and government of the country where he works Diplomatic immunity means that a diplomat can keep the secrets of his own countrys government without the government of the host country being able to find out about them

There is no precedent for any such thing at the main English Wikipedia which explicitly regards ALL settlements as encyclopedic regardless of size or age Also this page claims to be a guideline but it was practically railroaded in by an informal poll that I was not even aware of of only a few users on Simple Talk There is no practical way we can draw the line on what places are notable enough for inclusion and there is no reason why we should any more than the main English wikipedia Imagine a few decades from now when we are presumably much larger we could feasibly have an article for every spot on Earth but not if we senselessly delete places just because weve never heard of them Blockinblox  talk 1723 28 August 2007

Dipole can mean two things in physics The first is an electric dipole which separates the positive charge from the negative charge A simple example of this dipole is a pair of electric charges with the same magnitude but with the opposite type of charge and are separated by a small distance from each other The second is a magnetic dipole a closed circulation of electric current A simple example is a single loop of wire with electric current flowing through it

An important characeristic of dipoles is their dipole moment which is a vector quantity with both a magnitude and direction An example of an electric dipole moment occurring is in a pair of electric charges with opposite signs The dipole moment would point from the negative charge towards the positive charge The magnitude of the moment is equal to the strength of each charge multiplied by the distance separating between the charges An example of a magnetic dipole moment occurring is in a wire loop with flowing current The magnetic dipole moment would point through the loop with a magnitude equal to the current in the loop times the area of the loop

A bar magnet is an example of a magnetic dipole with a magnetic dipole moment moving from its south pole to its north pole

The Socialist Unity Party of Germany was the governing party of East Germany from 1949 when East Germany was created until the elections of 1990

The SED was created in 1946 when the Soviet Union forced the Social Democratic Party of Germany members and the Communist Party of Germany members who lived in the Soviet occupied parts of Germany and Berlin After 1990 the party reformed itself as the Party of Democratic Socialism It is still popular in the former East German territory winning seats at state and local elections In the September 2005 Bundestag election the PDS was in coalition with WASG which was formed by Oskar Lafontaine who left the SPD The PDS and WASG are joining together in 2007

A famous SED poster read To learn from Stalin means to learn how to win Later the word Stalin was replaced with the USSR When Gorbachev was president of the USSR the famous slogan was abandoned as the SED did not believe there was anything to learn from his ideas about perestroika

At first the SED had a branch in West Berlin but in 1962 the West Berlin branch was separated from the SED proper and became a separate party called the Socialist Unity Party of West Berlin

Between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the election in March 1990 the old Social Democratic Party was re established as a separate party while the rest of the SED lost a lot of members and renamed itself the Party of Democratic Socialism at a special party meeting in December 1989 By becoming the PDS the party survived the reuniting of East Germany any West Germany and eventually started growing again managing to get representatives elected to the Bundestag

These three party leaders are also the equivalent of the Prime Minister or President in other countries

Peridot is the gem quality version of the mineral olivine The name of the gemstone is believed to come from either the Arabic word faridat meaning gem or the French word peritot meaning unclear Peridot is one of the few gemstones that comes in only one color The darkness of the green depends on how much iron there is The color varies from yellow green to olive to brownish green Olivine is a very common mineral but gem quality peridot is rather rare Peridot is the birthstone for the month of August

An archivist is a professional who collects organizes preserves maintains control over and provides access to information determined to have long term value The information maintained by an archivist can be any form of media

As Richard Pearce Moses wrote Archivists keep records that have enduring value as reliable memories of the past and they help people find and understand the information they need in those records 

Determining what records have enduring value is not always easy Archivists must also select records valuable enough to justify the costs of storage and preservation plus the labor intensive expenses of arrangement description and reference service  The theory and scholarly work underpinning archives practices is called archival science

The voltaic pile was the first battery ever It was invented in 1800 by Alessandro Volta he was a physicist and he came from Italy

The picture to the right shows a voltaic pile Its a pile or stack of discs made from 3 different materials Some of the discs are made from copper and some are made from zinc Other metals can be used but its important that there are two different kinds of metal There are also discs made from leather or cardboard These are the green discs in the picture They have to be soaked or made wet with something acidic

Note how the discs follow a pattern First a disc made from one of the metals then a cardboard or leather disc and then a disc made from the other kind of metal Then the same kinds of discs in the same order again and again In the picture you can see how one set of a zinc disc a cardboard disc and a copper disc has been pushed a little to the right Such a set is called a cell The voltaic pile in the picture has 6 cells The two different metal discs in a cell will have a voltage across it about 11 volts Stacking cells in a pile adds the voltage of the cells From the discs at the top and bottom of the voltaic pile in the picture there is a voltage of 6 11 volts 66 volts

The acid in the leather or cardboard discs will try to dissolve some of the metal in the zinc discs To be dissolved a zinc atom must give away 2 of its electrons The zinc atom then becomes an ion Ions can go where they want to in the liquid acid They go through the leathercardboard disc and meet the copper disc The zinc ions are missing the two electrons they left behind so when they get to the copper disc they each steal two electrons to replace the missing ones When they steal electrons the zinc ions turn back from ions to normal zinc atoms

The end result is that the zinc disc ends up with a lot of electrons left behind by the zinc ions and the copper disc ends up missing a lot of electrons stolen by the zinc ions To use the electricity that comes from the pile we have to connect something that uses electricity to the two discs at the top and bottom of the pile This gives the electrons left behind in the zinc disc a chance to go to the copper disc At the copper disc the electrons replace those that were stolen from the copper by the zinc

Luigi Galvani was an Italian working with anatomy Around 1786 he had seen something interesting He had dissected a frog and when he touched a frogs leg with two tools made from different metals the leg moved even though the frog had been killed before the dissection

Galvani himself thought this had something to do with the leg and not with the metal tools he used Volta saw that the tools must be made from two different metals for the leg to move Volta also found that he could make a little bit of electricity just by making two different metals touch each other He thought that the two different metals gave something he called contact tension and the electricity came from that contact tension Galvani and Volta talked a lot about this but they never agreed

Volta tried to make use of it all He made experiments with rods of different kinds of metals in wine carafes This way he found that the best metals to use are silver and zinc He could also make it better by using flat discs instead of rods of metal That is because the discs have more surface area than the rod this gives more room for the zinc ions to leave one disc and get in touch with the other

Before the voltaic pile was invented people could only make static electricity With the voltaic pile one can make electricity that keeps flowing for some time With this kind of electricity scientists could do a lot of new things For instance when new kinds of metal were discovered the electricity from a voltaic pile could sort chemicals This way small but very pure bits of these new metals could be made

Arshile Gorky was an Armenian born American painter

Gorky had a seminal influence on Abstract Expressionism and Surrealism Gorky was born in the village of Khorgom situated on the shores of Lake Van It is not known exactly when he was born it was sometime between 1903 and 1905In later years Arshile Gorky was vague about even the date of his birth changing it from year to year In 1910 his father emigrated to America to avoid the draft leaving his family behind in the town of Van

A voltmeter is an instrument used to measure voltage For instance a voltmeter can be used to see if there is more electricity left in a battery The creation of voltmeters became possible when Hans Oersted invented the most simple voltmeter in 1819

The voltmeter can be connected with two wires to where the voltage is One wire is the positive one and the other the negative With some voltmeters one must make sure that the wires are connected right the positive connection on the voltmeter to the more positive part of the voltage source and the negative to the more negative part This way the voltmeter is parallel to the electrical circuit

One should also be careful about handling the connection If there is a high voltage one can get hurt or even killed by touching the metal connections with the voltage directly

voltage is not an electrical device

When the connections are made the voltmeter shows the voltage As there is no direct way to assess the voltage voltmeters are indeed designed as special ammeters which can calculate the voltage by assessing the electrical current and applying the Ohms law

There are two kinds of voltmeters One kind has a needle or pointer that points to a number that tells the number of volts This is the kind of voltmeter where one has to be careful about making the positive and negative connections right if wrong connections are made the voltmeter can be damaged

The second kind of voltmeter shows the numbers in a digital way just like digital clocks and calculators This kind of voltmeter is not damaged from wrong connections instead they just show a negative number

Also there are two types of voltmeters based on the current type some voltmeters are designed for use in direct current while others are designed for alternating current Modern voltmeters can work in both currents

All voltmeters have an upper limit or a maximum number of volts they can handle If a voltmeter is used for bigger voltages than it was made to handle it may damage or destroy it

Because it is important to use the right kind of voltmeter they are most often made so they can be adjusted to measure all kinds of voltages Such voltmeters usually have a knob or switch that can be set in different ways If the voltmeter is set in one way the voltmeter handles voltages up to for example 10 volts If the switch is set in another way the voltmeter can handle 100 volts and so on Inside the voltmeter the switch usually works by changing resistors in a voltage divider

In this way one single voltmeter can be used for a lot of different voltages large and small Some modern voltmeters can do this setting all by themselves one just has to make the connection and not worry about if the voltmeter can handle the voltage It will automatically find a setting that can handle it

Today a voltmeter is usually part of a multimeter an instrument that can work as both a voltmeter an ammeter and usually a few more measuring instruments These also have switces used to tell the multimeter to be a voltmeter

Multimeters often have more than two connections and part of telling the multimeter what to measure is done by choosing the right two connections This is explained in the manual for the multimeter and often shown next to the connection points nai nan undai pundai nakuran

The first type of voltmeters show the voltage using a needle or pointer pointing to the number of volts These voltmeters take energy from the thing being measured to move the needle Some very weak voltage sources might not have enough energy to move the needle to the right voltage In that case such a voltmeter shows too few volts The voltmeter is not sensitive enough

One solution to the above problem is to make the needle use as little energy as possible to move However there is a limit to how sensitive this kind of voltmeter can be When vacuum tubes and transistors were invented it became possible to build electronic amplifiers By using an amplifier a voltmeter can measure very small voltages from very weak sources Modern voltmeters and multimeters normally have this kind of amplifier in them

Powderfinger is a rock band from Brisbane Australia The band started in 1989 Powderfinger had five members Bernard Fanning Darren Middleton Ian Haug John Collins and Jon Coghill

After some extended plays that sold quite well and making one full album Powderfinger became popular in Australia with their second album Double Allergic Their third album Internationalist was even more popular and made them celebrities It sold over 350000 copies Odyssey Number Five was their fourth album and was released in 2000 It is their most famous album it was sold overseas in the United States and Canada Powderfingers next two albums were not as popular as the earlier ones but still got to number one on the Australian Recording Industry Association charts

Powderfinger started in Brisbane Australia in 1989 Ian Haug John Collins and Steven Bishop had been playing music with other bands when they decided to form Powderfinger The bands name came from the song Powderfinger by Neil Young Haug met Bernard Fanning at university and Fanning decided to join the band Later Jon Coghill joined when Bishop left Darren Middleton was the last person to join when Powderfinger saw one of his other bands playing and invited him to join

Powderfinger released their first extended play called Powderfinger in 1992 This was followed by Transfusion in 1993 Transfusion was popular in Australia and got to number one on the ARIA Alternative Chart a chart for alternative rock music Powderfinger signed a contract with record label Polydor after releasing Transfusion

Their first EPs did not sell badly so they made an album Parables for Wooden Ears in 1994 It did not do very well and Fanning said in an interview in 2004 that the music wasnt very good The band then released Double Allergic in 1996 This album became very popular in Australia it sold more than 200000 copies Jonathan Lewis from Allmusic said Double Allergic established Powderfinger as one of the most exciting Australian rock acts of the late 1990s When they were making Double Allergic Middleton said it was the best music the band had made so far After releasing the album Powderfinger went on a tour with You Am I playing at the Livid concerts

After Double Allergic Powderfinger began to work on their third album The band worked in Melbourne with a new producer Nick DiDia In 1998 they released Internationalist The album went to number one on the ARIA Albums Chart and stayed in the top 50 for 101 weeks It sold more than 350000 copies Internationalist was the first Powderfinger album to win an ARIA Award it won Album of the Year Best Rock Album and Best Cover Art at the 1999 ARIA Awards The Day You Come the first single won Single of the Year in 1999

On Internationalist Powderfinger included songs about their political opinions and social ideas but they said this was not done on purpose Internationalist sounded different to the bands first two albums This was because the band experimented with new ways of playing their music and writing songs

Powderfingers next album Odyssey Number Five is their most famous It won many awards including Album of the Year from Rolling Stone magazine and the 2001 Album of the Year ARIA Award It also got to number one on the ARIA Albums Chart From Odyssey Number Five Powderfinger released their most popular single My Happiness It won the 2001 Single of the Year ARIA Award and got to number four on the ARIA Singles Chart Two songs on Odyssey Number Five appeared in movies These Days was from the movie Two Handscite newstitleFive Easy PiecespublisherSainauthorChristie EliszerdateSeptember 2000ref and My Kind of Scene was part of Mission Impossible II

Odyssey Number Five was Powderfingers shortest album yet Similar to Internationalist it talked about political and social issues It also had numerous songs about love Fanning liked listening to gospel music and to soul which is often about love and wrote his own songs after listening to that Reviewers disagreed on the album Entertainment Weekly liked it and gave it a B saying the album experimented well while Allmusic gave it one and a half stars out of five saying Powderfinger were too careful and not aggressive enough Powderfinger toured around North America with Coldplay to help promote Odyssey Number Five

In 2003 Powderfinger released their fifth album Vulture Street It was named after a street in Brisbane where the band would rehearsecite weburlhttpwwwtheagecomauarticles200309191063625142523html titleQuiet conquerorspublisherThe Agedate19 September 2003accessdate2008 06 30ref Vulture Street got to number one on the ARIA Albums Chart but did not stay on the chart for as long as the two albums before it Vulture Street won four ARIA Awards including Album of the Year in 2003

Vulture Street contained louder guitars and drums than the albums before it especially Odyssey Number Five Bernard Zuel from The Sydney Morning Herald said it was a rawer louder but by no means unrefined albumcite weburlhttpwwwsmhcomauarticles200307101057783275797html titlePowderfinger Vulture StreetpublisherThe Sydney Morning HeraldauthorBernard Zueldate11 July 2003accessdate2008 06 30ref Some of the album was recorded during jam sessions and was similar to what Powderfinger sounded like when playing live Kenneth Nguyen from The Age said the band play a crowd pleasing set

In 2004 Powderfinger released a CDDVD of themselves playing a concert in Sydney The release was called These Days Live in Concert After this they released a best of album called Fingerprints The Best of Powderfinger 19942000 This included singles from their albums so far some songs that were not released as singles but appeared on albums and two new songs Both compilations did well on the ARIA Albums Chart reaching number two

After releasing Fingerprints The Best of Powderfinger 19942000 Powderfinger said they would have a rest from working together During this break Bernard Fanning made his own music releasing an album called Tea Sympathycite weburlhttpwwwtheaustraliannewscomaustory02519717032570 1694700html titleLove and other bruisesworkThe AustralianauthorIain Sheddendate29 October 2005accessdate2008 07 01ref Darren Middleton released an album called The Way Out with Drag another band he plays in Ian Haug and John Collins made a band called The Predators during this time with Steven Bishop who had left Powderfinger around 1992 The Predators made an EP called Pick Up the Pacecite weburlhttpwwwamoorgauqainterviewaspid1203archiveurlhttpwebarchiveorgweb20071021055917httpamoorgauqainterviewaspid1203archivedate2007 10 21 titleMeet new Brisbane outfit The PredatorspublisherAustralian Music Onlinedate3 July 2006accessdate2009 07 01ref

During the break Fanning married his girlfriend Andrea The wives of Middleton and Haug both had children during the break

Powderfinger returned from their break and began work on their sixth album in 2006 The band recorded in Los Angeles with Rob Schnapf and released Dream Days at the Hotel Existence in 2007 The albums name came from a book called Brookly Follies that Fanning was reading when the band recorded Dream Days at the Hotel Existence contained songs about politics and the lives of Indigenous Australians and also about love Because of the political lyrics on one song Black Tears the album was nearly banned

The album sold well and was number one in Australia like many of Powderfingers previous albums However critics did not like it as much as the bands older work Barnaby Smith of musicOMH said the volume has been turned down but he said that was not always a good thing

After the album was released Powderfinger went on a concert tour with Silverchair another Australian band On the tour called the Across the Great Divide tour the band played shows in lots of cities in Australia and New Zealand They did the tour to help Reconciliation Australia an Australian charity that tries to improve the lives of Indigenous Australians

Powderfinger have done a lot of work for charities and philanthropic causes In 2004 the band played at WaveAid a concert in response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake The concert made over 2 million in profit which was donated to help survivors of the earthquake

The 2007 Across the Great Divide tour featured Powderfinger and Silverchair playing concerts across Australia to help promote Reconciliation Australia a charity that tries to improve the lives of Indigenous Australians More than 200000 saw the bands play After the tour the bands released a DVD which included the bands performing and interviews with their members

In October 2007 Powderfinger played a concert at the Sydney Opera House as part of Breast Cancer Awareness Month Only people who had breast cancer and their families were invited to the show Silverchair and Missy Higgins also performed After the concert Fanning said that musicians have a guilty conscience in general about their lives being quite good and tend to be aware of social issues

A hadith is the narration of an event from the life of Muhammad the prophet of Islam In English the word hadith is also used as the plural word for a group of these narrations although the plural in Arabic is a HAA deeth 

The word hadith means something new or a piece of information The religious meaning of hadith is a statement action or approval attributed to the Prophet of Islam Muhammad Therefore hadith can be divided into three categories based upon their content

After Muhammad died Muslim scholars wrote down stories about what he had said and done They also wrote down facts about who told each story Some of the stories were retold many times before they were written down and some stories did not agree in every detail resulting in the detailed study of hadith by scholars to compare between those hadith

Muslim scholars collected all of these Hadith in books and compared them to each other They decided which Hadith were most likely to be true records of the Sunnah that is the words and actions of Muhammad Muslims see the Sunnah as an important source of guidance along with the Quranislam is the complete religion so nothing could be changed about itIt gives A complete code of life

A hereditary monarchy is a type of government where a monarch becomes the monarch because he or she is related to the last monarch It is the most common sort of monarchy and is the form used by almost all of the worlds monarchies today 

In a hereditary monarchy all the monarchs come from the same family and the crown is passed down from one member of the family to another The hereditary system can be more stable and can command loyalty but at other times has seen great bloodshed over the question of succession

When the king or queen of a hereditary monarchy dies or quits the throne the crown is generally passed to one of his or her children often to the oldest When that child dies the crown will be then passed to his or her child or if he or she has no child to a sister brother niece nephew cousin or some other relative Hereditary monarchies most usually arrange the succession by a law that creates an order of succession This way it is known beforehand who will be the next monarch

Nowadays the order of succession in hereditary monarchies is often based on the idea of primogeniture but there have been other methods that were much more common in the past

In the past there were differences in systems of succession often depending on whether only men can succeed or whether both men and women could succeed 

Agnatic succession means women are not allowed to succeed or pass the succession from their fathers to their children Agnates are relatives who have a common ancestor in an unbroken male line from father to father 

Cognatic succession means both men and women can succeed Women usually are only allowed succeed if there is no male in the family For example in the United Kingdom Princess Anne comes after her younger brothers in the line of succession 

In the 1970s Sweden changed from agnatic succession to fully cognatic succession This means the line of succession is based on age not sex This meant that when Princess Victoria of Sweden was born she could never become queen and when her younger brother was born he became crown prince  but then the law changed and Victoria became crown princess

An elective monarchy can sometimes seem to be a hereditary monarch For example only members of one family may be allowed to be elected or before the monarch dies they might have his chosen heir elected

The Stratocaster has been copied as well A guitar may look the same as a Stratocaster but if it is not produced by Fender or Squier it is called a strat copy 

Fender Stratocaster copies are mostly very cheap and low quality but some guitar builders make high quality clones of the Stratocaster Fender makes Stratocasters made in the United States of America which are largely thought to be the highest quality However they also make Stratocasters which are made in Japan but only sell them to the Japanese Many people view these guitars comparable and even superior to the American made Fenders

Stratocasters are also made in Korea and sold as special editions The cheapest Fenders are made in Mexico but despite their price these Stratocasters are very good quality guitars compared to the copies which are usually made in China Squier makes Stratocasters in China and Indonesia

Fender Strats made in Japan and Korea are sometimes equal to their American Standard cousin Limited editions like the Pro Tone series and some early Japanese models fetch prices from 400 800 depending on condition Korean Strats that have the Fender decal are the desirable ones over the Korean models with Squier on the headstock where Fender should be There are also American Made Squiers that can be of good quality Korean Pro Tones are the cream of the Korean Crop

A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England and covers urban areas within metropolitan counties

The current metropolitan boroughs were created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972 as subdivisions of the new metropolitan counties which were created to cover the six largest urban areas in England outside Greater London

The new authorities were actually defined by law as metropolitan districts however all of them have borough status or city status The new metropolitan boroughs replaced the county boroughs municipal boroughs and urban and rural districts which existed before The districts typically have populations of 174000 to 11 million

In 1986 the old metropolitan county councils were abolished by the Local Government Act 1985 and most of their functions were given to the boroughs so they are to a large extent unitary authorities Some of the functions of the abolished county councils were taken over by joint bodies such as Passenger Transport Authorities and joint fire police and waste disposal authorities

The 36 current metropolitan boroughs are

The Local Government Act 1972 is an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom that reformed local government in England and Wales on 1 April 1974 

Its pattern of two tier councils remains in use today in large parts of England although the metropolitan county councils were abolished in 1986 and it was replaced with unitary authorities in many areas in the 1990s In Wales it established a similar pattern of counties and districts  These have since been entirely replaced with a system of unitary authorities In Scotland the Local Government Act 1973 established a similar system of two tier regions and districts in 1975 this was also replaced by a system of unitary council areas in 1996

Elections were held to the new authorities in 1973 and they acted as shadow authorities until the handover date Elections to county councils were held on April 12 for metropolitan and Welsh districts on May 10 for non metropolitan district councils on June 7

The Local Government Boundary Commission originally proposed 278 non metropolitan districts in April 1972 A further eighteen districts were added in the final proposals of November 1972 which were then ordered

The splits were as follows

The new district in Suffolk was necessitated by the decision to keep Newmarket in Suffolk which would otherwise have become part of the South Cambridgeshire district

Section 265 af the Act allowed for the continuation of the local government arrangements for the Isles of Scilly The Isles of Scilly Rural District Council became the Council of the Isles of Scilly and certain services were to continue to be provided by Cornwall County Council as provided by order in council made by the Secretary of State although the Isles were not technically in Cornwall before or after 1974

Elections were held to the new authorities on three different Thursdays in 1973 Each new county and district was divided into electoral divisions For county councils each electoral division elected one member for metropolitan district councils each ward elected three members and wards in non metropolitan districts could elect a varying number of members There was not sufficient time to conduct a full warding arrangement so a temporary system was used in some county councils electoral divisions elected multiple councillors

Aargau is divided into 11 districts

The Netherlands have in 2009 441 municipalities in twelve provinces

The modern day Netherlands are divided into twelve provinces

The twelve provinces are listed below with their capital city

A Dutch province is the administrative layer in between the national government and the local municipalities It has the responsibility for matters of regional importance The government of each province is made of three major parts the Provinciale Staten which is the provincial parliament elected every four years Elected from its members are the Gedeputeerde Staten a college charged with most executive tasks This college is presided by the Commissaris van de Koningin or royal commissioner appointed by the Crown

Almost all Dutch provinces came from a medieval state like a county or duchy This is the same with the regions of Belgium Their status changed once they came under the influence of a ruler This single ruler then centralised their administration They then became provinces of a larger state In total there are 17 provinces today From these unified Netherlands seven northern provinces formed the Republic of the Seven United Provinces in the 16th century These were Holland Zeeland Gelderland Utrecht Friesland Overijssel and Groningen The Republics lands also included Drenthe and parts of Brabant Limburg and Flanders which were considered to be conquered lands and were governed directly by the Staten Generaal the parliament From this came their name Generality Lands They were called Staats Brabant Staats Limburg and Staats Vlaanderen meaning of the state Each of these Netherlands had a high degree of autonomy They co operated with each other mainly on defense and on the international level in general They kept to their own affairs elsewhere

On January 1 1796 during the Batavian Republic Drenthe and Staats Brabant became the eighth and ninth provinces of the Netherlands the latter known as Bataafs Brabant Batavian Brabant changing its name to Noord Brabant North Brabant in 1815 when it became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands This kingdom also contained South Brabant a province in Belgium This new unified state featured the provinces in their modern form Today they are non autonomous subdivisions of the national state There are again numbering 17 provinces though not all are the same as the 16th century ones In 1839 with the independence of Belgium the original single province of Limburg was divided between the two countries Each country now has a province called Limburg A year later Holland the largest and most populous of the Dutch provinces was also split into two provinces for a total of 11 The 12th member was to be Flevoland a province consisting almost entirely of reclaimed land established on January 1 1986

During the Batavian Republic the Netherlands were from 1798 to 1801 completely reorganised into 8 new departments most named after rivers inspired by the French revolutionary example in an attempt to do away with the old autonomous provincial status They are listed below with their capitals and the territory of the former provinces they mostly incorporated

After only three years following a coup detat the borders of the former provinces were restored though not their autonomous status They were now also called departments and Drenthe was added to Overijssel In 1806 the Kingdom of Holland replaced the republic to further French interests It was during this administration that Holland was first split in two with the department of Amstelland to the north and that of Maasland to the south East Frisia then as now in Germany was added to the kingdom as a department in 1807 and Drenthe split off again making a total of 11 departments

When the Netherlands finally did become fully part of France in 1810 the departments of the kingdom and their borders were largely maintained with some joined together They were however nearly all renamed again mainly after rivers though the names differed from their Batavian counterparts Following are their names and the modern day province they corresponded for the most part to

With the defeat and withdrawal of the French in 1813 the old provinces and their names were re established Holland was reunited and East Frisia went its separate way The 17 provinces of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands were for a significant part based on the former French departments and their borders in particular in what would later become Belgium

Flevoland is one of the provinces of the Netherlands Lelystad is its capital but Almere is its biggest city About 370000 people live in the province

North Brabant is a province of the Netherlands It is in the south of the country It is bordered by Belgium in the south the Meuse River in the north Limburg in the east and Zeeland in the west See Google maps Its capital is s Hertogenbosch The largest city is Eindhoven

The Local Government Act 1985 was an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom Its main effect was to broken wikt linkabolishabolish the county councils of the metropolitan counties that had been set up in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972 along with the Greater London Council that had been established in 1965

The main broken wikt linkprovisionprovision section 1 stated that the Greater London Council and the metropolitan county councils shall not exist anymore

It came into effect on April 1 1986 The metropolitan boroughs and London boroughs got some of the powers of the former institutions but others went to central government At the time of the Act one third of the population of England were living in Greater London and the metropolitan counties

The act established a system of joint boards to take over some of the functions of the abolished councils in the metropolitan counties and in Greater London The joint boards had councillors appointed by the boroughs 

The Act was passed by Margaret Thatchers government after a series of disputes between the councils and the central government

The Greater London Council was the local government administrative body for Greater London from 1965 to 1986 It replaced the earlier London County Council which had covered a much smaller area

The Labour Party had controlled the LCC from 1934 and by the 1950s the Conservative Government considered that elections were becoming one sided since the London County Council covered only the inner districts The government sought to create a new body covering all of London

Livingstones high spend socialist policies put the GLC into direct conflict with Margaret Thatchers Conservative government Livingstone soon became a thorn in the side of the sitting Tory government He deliberately antagonised Mrs Thatcher through a series of actions including posting a billboard of Londons rising unemployment figures on the side of and endorsing a statue of Nelson Mandela whilst Thatcher regarded the future South African president as a terrorist

By 1983 Thatcher was determined to crush both Livingstone and the GLC and the Cabinet agreed in principle to abolish the GLC and give its functions to the boroughs 

The Local Government Act 1985 which abolished the GLC faced considerable opposition from many quarters but was narrowly passed in Parliament setting the end of the council for 31 March 1986

After its abolition London was left as the only major city in the world without a central administrative body Most of the powers of the GLC were given to the London boroughs Some powers such as the fire service were taken over by joint boards made up of councillors appointed by the boroughs  see waste authorities in Greater London for an example In total around 100 organisations were responsible for service delivery in Greater London

It was argued by many people that this situation was chaotic and un coordinated and a new London wide body was needed to co ordinate the whole city 

Tony Blairs Labour government was elected in 1997 and was committed to bring back London wide government In 1999 a referendum was held on the establishment of a new London authority and elected mayor which was approved by a two to one margin 

The new Greater London Authority was established in 2000 The GLA has a very different structure to the GLC it consisted of a directly elected Mayor of London and a London Assembly The Mayor of London elections were won by the same Ken Livingstone who began his victory speech with the words As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted 14 years ago

The Greater London Authority controls the 1579 km of Greater London England covering the 32 London boroughs and the City of London The GLA consists of an elected Mayor and the 25 members of the London Assembly The current Mayor of London is Boris Johnson

The GLA was created to improve the coordination between the London boroughs and the Mayor of Londons role is to give London a single person to represent it The Mayor proposes policy and the GLAs budget and makes appointments to the capitals strategic transport body and economic development body 

One of the primary purposes of the London Assembly is to hold the Mayor of London to account The Assembly must also accept or amend the Mayors budget on an annual basis

The GLA is different from the Corporation of the City of London with its largely ceremonial Lord Mayor Corporation controls only the square mile of the City Londons chief financial centre The GLA governs a much wider area 

The GLA is at City Hall a new building on the south bank of the River Thames next to Tower Bridge

The Mayor of London is an elected politician in London The role created in 2000 was the first directly elected mayor in the United Kingdom The Mayor of London is also referred to as the London Mayor a form which helps to avoid confusion with the Lord Mayor of London the ancient and now mainly ceremonial role in the City of London The Mayor of London is mayor of Greater London which has a population of over 75 million while the City of London is only a small part of the modern city centre and has a population of less than 10000 The first elected Mayor of London is Ken Livingstone who was re elected in 2004 In 2008 Boris Johnson became mayor

The Mayor is responsible for budgeting and strategic planning of some governmental functions across the whole of the London region The plans of the mayor are looked at by the London Assembly and actioned by the Greater London Authority Responsibilities include transport the police fire and emergency services cultural strategy and economic development

The mayor of Londons salary is one that ranks along that of a government cabinet ministers The current salary is 137579 per year

Deal or No Deal is a game show in more than 40 countries on the world created by John de Mol

Deal or No Deal involves a contestant a hostpresenter a banker and a number of briefcases with each having a different value Each game starts with the contestant selecting one of the casesthis first cases value is not known until the game ends  During the rest of the game the contestant opens the rest of the cases one at a time revealing its value Each time after a specified number of cases are opened the banker offers the contestant a certain amount of money to end the game If the contestant takes an offer the game ends otherwise the contestant ends up with the money from the first case

Since the range of possible values for cases is known at the start of each game how much the banker offers at any given point changes based on what cases have been eliminated To promote suspense and lengthen games the bankers offer usually strays from the expected value dictated by probability theory particularly early in the game However it is not uncommon for the banks offer to exceed the players expected value very late in the game

Worldwide the largest amount offer was 1495000 on the original Miljoenenjacht on November 13 2005 Only a few people have ever won the top prize on any version of the show

Banksia is a genus of plants common to Australia they were named after Joseph Banks The Banksia are noted for there unique flowering

It is a genus of around 80 species in the plant family Proteaceae As Australian wildflowers and popular garden plants they are easily recognised by their characteristic flower spikes and fruiting cones and can vary from woody shrubs to trees up to 30 metres tall They are generally found in a wide variety of landscapes rainforest shrubland and some more arid landscapes though not in Australias deserts

Heavy producers of nectar banksias form a vital part of the food chain in the Australian bush They are an important food source for all sorts of nectariferous animals including birds bats rats possums and a host of invertebrates Furthermore they are of economic importance to Australias nursery and cut flower industries However these plants are threatened by a number of processes including land clearing frequent burning and disease and a number of species are rare and endangered

London County Council was the principal local government body for the County of London during its whole existence and the first London wide general municipal authority that was directly elected It covered the area today known as Inner London and was replaced by the Greater London Council The LCC was the largest most significant and ambitious municipal authority of its day 

The creation of the LCC in 1889 as part of the Local Government Act 1888 was forced by a succession of scandals involving the Metropolitan Board of Works its predecessor which had not been directly elected While the Conservative government of the day would have preferred not to create a single body covering the whole of London their election promise to the Liberal Unionists led them to this policy A later Government created the 28 metropolitan boroughs as lower tier authorities to replace the various local authorities in 1899 they assumed some powers of the LCC and shared others

The LCC inherited the powers of its predecessor the MBW but also had wider authority over matters such as education city planning and council housing It took over the functions of the London School Board in 1903 and Dr C W Kimmins was appointed chief inspector of the education department in 1904 

When dealing with money denomination is the value of the individual currency 

For example a one dollar bill a 100 dollar bill a penny and a quarter are all different denominations of money A one dollar bill and a one dollar coin are the same denomination as they are the same value

When countries form a monetary union redenomination may be required and the conversion ratio is often not a nice even number or even less than 1

In many countries where an sd system is used the process of decimalisation was carried out While they were at it some chose to change the main unit as well By defining 1 dollar 05 100 cents 1 shilling would conveniently turn into 10 cents This is also a prime example where the ratio is less than 1

A simulation is a way of seeing a thing happen without it actually taking place in the same way A simulation can be used to predict what might happen without doing it in case it is dangerous or too expensive or difficult It can also be used to show people what will happen next or what happened in the past It can also show what people believe is happening in a place or time where it is impossible to know what really happens 

There are research institutions just devoted to simulations like eg The George E Brown Jr Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation or NEES

Simulations are very useful all over the world because in a simulation things can be controlled that might not be easy to control in real life They can use or smaller versions of an object or system for testing or practice They can often use smaller versions of things like space ships or rooms to simulate the real thing They can also use a safer thing in place of a thing that is dangerous like when astronauts practice in a swimming pool rather than in outer space Astronauts also practice in simulations of the moon before they went and landed there and in simulations of spaceships that move the way real spaceships do so they can get used to it Simulations often use computers or television Computers are used to make simulations of what a spaceships route might be on the way to the moon to help plan the mission

One type of video game is called simulator games These games let the player simulate doing different things For example in the game Theme Hospital players perform simulated surgery SimCity lets players design and build their own simulated city

Brooms are a group of evergreen semi evergreen and deciduous shrubs

All the brooms and their relatives grow in Europe north Africa and southwest Asia The greatest diversity one can find in the Mediterranean region Many brooms are fire climax species adapted to regular stand replacing fires which kill the above ground parts of the plants but create conditions for regrowth from the roots and also for germination of stored seeds in the soil

The most familiar is common broom that grows in northwestern Europe One can find it in sunny sites usually on dry sandy soils Like most brooms it has apparently leafless stems that in spring and summer are covered with golden yellow flowers In late summer its pea pod like seed capsules burst open often with an audible pop spreading seed from the parent plant It makes a shrub about 13m tall rarely to 4m It is also the hardiest broom tolerating temperatures down to about 25C

The brooms belong to the subfamily Faboideae of the legume family Fabaceae mainly in the three genera Chamaecytisus Cytisus and Genista but also in five other small genera All genera in this group are from the tribe Genisteae These genera are all closely related and share similar characteristics of dense slender green stems and very small leaves adaptations to dry growing conditions Most of the species have yellow flowers but a few have white orange red pink or purple flowers 

A traditional rhyme from Sussex says Sweep the house with blossed broom in Maysweep the head of the household away Despite this it was also common to include a decorated bundle of broom at weddings Ashes of broom were used to treat dropsy while its strong smell was said to be able to tame wild horses and dogs

A broom is a cleaning tool It consists of stiff fibres attached to and roughly parallel to a cylindrical handle the broomstick In the context of witchcraft broomstick is likely to refer to the broom as a whole A smaller whisk broom or brush is sometimes called a duster

Brooms have changed very much in their construction since they developed from ad hoc use of branches and bundles of several natural fibres Originally all brooms were round a shape that is easy to construct but inefficient for actually sweeping Brooms could be attached to a handle either short for a whisk broom or long for a broom used to sweep the floor or fireplace The word for the tool was originally besom broom simply being the material of which it was normally made The fibres used in modern brooms are from broom corn They are long straight durable and bound together in the plant The newest major change is the flat broom invented by the Shakers in the 1800s which has far more width for pushing dirt and nearly all brooms produced today are flat brooms

Brooms have long been connected with witchcraft almost universally portrayed as medieval style round brooms and associated with female witches Despite the association with women in 1453 the first known case of claiming to have flown on a broomstick is recorded confessed by the male witch Guillaume Edelin 

A broom is a cleaning tool which also had other uses eg magical and for punishment

Broom may also mean

Cleanliness means that there is no dirt no dust no stains no bad smells The purposes of cleanliness is health beauty absence of offensive odor and to avoid the spreading of dirt and contaminants to oneself and others In the case of glass objects such as windows or windshields the purpose can also be transparency Washing is one way of achieving cleanliness usually with water and often some kind of soap or detergent 

Since the germ theory of disease it has also come to mean an absence of germs and other waste In industry certain processes need conditions of exceptional cleanliness which are achieved by working in cleanrooms A very new idea is that dirt may play a useful role in our immune systems

Washing is one way of cleaning with water and often some kind of soap or detergent Washing is an essential part of good hygiene and health

Soaps and detergents help to spread the oils and dirt particles through the water so they can be washed away The spreading of oil through water is called emulsification 

People usually wash themselves periodically 

Car Wash can mean

The Wash is the square mouthed estuary on the northwest margin of East Anglia on the east coast of England where Norfolk meets Lincolnshire It is among the largest estuaries in the United Kingdom It is listed as a Ramsar site as being an important wetland area

The Wash looks on the map like a large bite out of the coastline of eastern England It separates the curved coast of East Anglia from Lincolnshire It is formed by a large bay with three roughly straight sides meeting at right angles each about 25 kilometres in length All the eastern coast of the Wash is in Norfolk and goes from Hunstanton in the north to the mouth of the River Great Ouse at Kings Lynn in the south The coast on the opposite side goes from Gibraltar Point to the mouth of the River Welland and is all in Lincolnshire The southern coast goes roughly northwest southeast joining these two river mouths In the middle is the mouth of a third river the River Nene

The most famous thing that people remember about the Wash is that King John lost his crown in the Wash This is because according to reports from the time King John travelled from Spalding in Lincolnshire to Bishops Lynn in Norfolk in the year 1216 He became ill and decided to go back While he took the longer route through Wisbech he sent his luggage including his crown jewels along the seashore and across the mouth of the Wellstream where the water was not deep This route was only safe when the tide was low The horse drawn wagons moved too slowly for the incoming tide and many were lost

The Thar Desert also known as the Great Indian Desert is a desert located in western Republic of India and southeastern Pakistan It lies mostly in the Indian state of Rajasthan It extends into the southern portion of Haryana and Punjab states and into northern Gujarat state In Pakistan the desert covers eastern Sindh province and the southeastern portion of Pakistans Punjab province In Pakistans Punjab province it is known as the Cholistan desert Tharparkar District of province Sindh Pakistan is also a part of Thar desert The Thar Desert is bounded on the northwest by the Sutlej River on the east by the Aravalli Range on the south by the salt marsh known as the Rann of Kutch and on the west by the Indus River In India it consists of the following districts

Its boundary to the large thorny steppe to the north is badly defined Depending on what areas are included or excluded the nominal size of the Thar can vary significantly

Thyme is a genus of perennial plants There are about 350 different species of thyme They are herbaceous plants and sub shrubs They can grow to about 40 cm tall They are the family Lamiaceae and native to Europe North Africa and Asia A few species have different chemotypes The stems are usually narrow sometimes even wiry The leaves are evergreen in most species They are arranged in opposite pairs oval entire and small 4 20 mm long The flowers are in dense terminal heads with an uneven calyx with the upper lip three lobed and the lower cleft the corolla is tubular 4 10 mm long and white pink or purple

Thymus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera insect species including Chionodes distinctella and the Coleophora case bearers C lixella C niveicostella C serpylletorum and C struella

Ancient Egyptians used thyme for embalming The ancient Greeks used it in their baths and burnt it as incense in their temples They believed that thyme was a source of courage It was thought that the spread of thyme throughout Europe was thanks to the Romans as they used it to purify their rooms In the European Middle Ages the herb was placed under pillows This was done to help sleep and ward off nightmares In this period women would also often give knights and warriors gifts that included thyme leaves People believed it would bring courage to the bearer Thyme was also used as incense and placed on coffins during funerals as it was supposed to assure passage into the next life

Thyme is widely grown as a herb Usually it is grown for its strong flavour which is due to its content of thymol

Thyme likes a hot sunny location with good draining soil It is planted in the spring and later grows as a perennial It can be propagated by seed cuttings or by dividing rooted sections of the plant It tolerates drought well

Thyme keeps its flavour on drying better than many other herbs

Thyme is widely used for cooking Thyme is a basic ingredient in French and Italian cuisines and in those derived from them It is also widely used in Caribbean cuisine

Thyme is often used to flavour meats soups and stews It has a particular affinity to and is often used as a primary flavour with lamb tomatoes and eggs

Thyme while flavourful does not overpower and blends well with other herbs and spices In French cuisine along with bay and parsley it is a common component of the bouquet garni and of herbes de Provence In some Middle Eastern countries the condiment zaatar contains thyme as a vital ingredient

Thyme is sold both fresh and dried The fresh form is more flavourful but also less convenient storage life is rarely more than a week While summer seasonal fresh thyme is often available year round Fresh thyme is commonly sold in bunches of sprigs A sprig is a single stem snipped from the plant It is composed of a woody stem with paired leaf or flower clusters spaced to 1 apart A recipe may measure thyme by the bunch or by the sprig or by the tablespoon or teaspoon If the recipe does not specify fresh or dried assume that it means fresh Depending on how it is used in a dish the whole sprig may be used or the leaves removed and the stems discarded Usually when a recipe specifies bunch or sprig it means the whole form when it specifies spoons it means the leaves It is perfectly acceptable to substitute dried for whole thyme Leaves may be removed from stems either by scraping with the back of a knife or by pulling through the fingers or tines of a fork Leaves are often chopped

Thyme retains its flavour on drying better than many other herbs Dried and especially powdered thyme occupies less space than fresh so less of it is required when substituted in a recipe As a rule of thumb use one third as much dried as fresh thyme  a little less if it is ground Substitution is often more complicated than that because recipes can specify sprigs and sprigs can vary in yield of leaves Assuming a 4 sprig estimate that 6 sprigs will yield one tablespoon of leaves The dried equivalent is 13 so substitute 1 teaspoon of dried or tsp of ground thyme for 6 small sprigs 

As with bay thyme is slow to release its flavours so it is usually added early in the cooking process

The essential oil of common thyme is made up of 20 55 thymol Thymol an antiseptic is the main active ingredient in Listerine mouthwash Before the advent of modern antibiotics it was used to medicate bandages It has also been shown to be effective against the fungus that commonly infects toenails

A tea made by infusing the herb in water can be used for cough and bronchitis Medicinally thyme is used for respiratory infections in the form of a tincture tisane salve syrup or by steam inhalationFactdateMarch 2007 Because it is antiseptic thyme boiled in water and cooled is very effective against inflammation of the throat when gargled 3 times a dayFactdateJuly 2007 The inflammation will normally disappear in 2  5 days Other infections and wounds can be dripped with thyme that has been boiled in water and cooledFactdateJuly 2007

In traditional Jamaican childbirth practice thyme tea is given to the mother after delivery of the baby Its oxytocin like effect causes uterine contractions and more rapid delivery of the placenta but this was said by Sheila Kitzinger to cause an increased prevalence of retained placenta

Thymus vulgaris is a commonly used culinary herb It also has medicinal uses Common thyme is a Mediterranean perennial which is best suited to well drained soils and enjoys full sun

Thymus herba barona is used both as a culinary herb and a groundcover and has a strong caraway scent due to the chemical carvone

Thymus citriodorus is also a popular culinary herb with cultivars selected with flavours of various Citrus fruit

Thymus pseudolanuginosus is not a culinary herb but is grown as a ground cover

Thymus serpyllum is an important nectar source plant for honeybees All thyme species are nectar sources but wild thyme covers large areas of droughty rocky soils in southern Europe and North Africa as well as in similar landscapes in the Berkshire Mountains and Catskill Mountains of the northeastern US

There are a number of different cultivars of thyme with established or growing popularity including

The word distribution has several meanings

Economics 

Computer science 

Distributed computing is a word from computer science about using many computers to solve a big problem One way to solve a big problem is to use a very fast computer called a supercomputer Supercomputers are very expensive and many scientists can not buy them A cheaper way to solve a big problem is to split it into smaller problems when possible These smaller problems can then be solved by different computers which talk to each other over a computer network Because many computers work together this makes them as powerful as a supercomputer One example where distributed computing is used is the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search

In statistics a frequency distribution is a list of the values that a variable takes in a sample It is usually a list ordered by quantity It will show the number of times each value appears For example if 100 people rate a five point Likert scale assessing their agreement with a statement on a scale on which 1 denotes strong agreement and 5 strong disagreement the frequency distribution of their responses might look like

This simple table has two drawbacks When a variable can take continuous values instead of discrete values or when the number of possible values is too large the table construction is difficult if it is not impossible A slightly different scheme based on the range of values is used in such cases For example if we consider the heights of the students in a class the frequency table might look like below

Managing and operating on frequency tabulated data is much simpler than operation on raw data There are simple algorithms to calculate median mean standard deviation etc from these tables

Statistical hypothesis testing is based on the assessment of differences and similarities between frequency distributions This assessment involves measures of central tendency or averages such as the mean and median and measures of variability or statistical dispersion such as the standard deviation or variance

A frequency distribution is said to be skewed when its mean and median are different The kurtosis of a frequency distribution is the concentration of scores at the mean or how peaked the distribution appears if depicted graphicallyfor example in a histogram If the distribution is more peaked than the normal distribution it is said to be leptokurtic if less peaked it is said to be platykurtic

A British Overseas Territory is one of fourteen territories which the United Kingdom considers to be under its sovereignty but not as part of the United Kingdom itself

Before 1981 the territories were known as colonies or Crown colonies The British Overseas Territories are also referred to as overseas territories of the United Kingdom UK overseas territories or when the context is clear simply the Overseas Territories

The territories of Jersey Guernsey and the Isle of Man though also under the sovereignty of the British Crown have a slightly different constitutional relationship with the United Kingdom and are consequently classed as Crown dependencies rather than Overseas Territories Territories and dependencies are distinct from the Commonwealth of Nations a voluntary association of former British colonies

In a historical context colonies should be distinguished from protectorates and protected states which though under British control were nominally independent states whereas colonies were part of the British state They should also not be confused with Dominions which known collectively as the Commonwealth were independent states held to be equal in sovereign status to the United Kingdom within the Empire and Commonwealth after the Statute of Westminster in 1931 Crown colonies such as Hong Kong were differentiated from other colonies in being administered directly by the Crown without the degree of local autonomy found in self governed colonies such as Bermuda

The head of state in the Overseas Territories is the British monarch currently Queen Elizabeth II The Queens role in the territories is in her role as Queen of the United Kingdom and not in right of each territory The Queen appoints a representative in each territory to exercise her executive power 

All the Overseas Territories have their own system of government and localised laws The structure of the government appears to be closely correlated to the size and political development of the territory

Each Overseas Territory has its own legal system independent of the United Kingdom The legal system is generally based on English common law with some distinctions for local circumstances Each territory has its own Attorney General and court system For the smaller territories the UK may appoint a UK based lawyer or judge to work on legal cases This is particularly important for cases involving serious crimes and where it is impossible to find a jury who will not know the defendant in a small population island

The word Promenade Concert today usually refers to one of the concerts in the series started by Henry Wood in 1895 known today as the BBC Proms However before these concerts started there had for many years been promenade concerts in the parks of London These concerts took place in the leisure gardens where people could walk about while listening to the music

People had to pay to go into the leisure gardens There were lots of entertainments there eg fireworks dancing acrobatics and music The music was played by orchestras Sometimes these orchestras played in bandstands sometimes in proper buildings 

Vauxhall Gardens and Ranelagh Gardens were the most famous of these gardens The composer George Frideric Handel had his music played there in the 18th century The gardens were very fashionable until the 19th century Aristocratic people royalty and ordinary people all mixed there Handels Music for the Royal Fireworks was performed in Vauxhall Gardens to celebrate the Treaty of Aix la Chapelle The composer Dr Thomas Arne was appointed composer of Vauxhall Gardens in 1745 It was here that many of his songs became popular including Rule Britannia Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Joseph Haydn performed in Ranelagh Gardens on their visits to London 

In the 19th century concerts of classical music became very popular The conductor Louis Antoine Jullien conducted many concerts His orchestra were even joined by the bands of the Royal Artillery or drummers from the French National Guard Concerts were also given in Crystal Palace the huge glass building which was built for the Great Exhibition in 1851

Many English composers had their music played in these parks The music was often long songs or drinking songs Sometimes choirs sang choruses from oratorios by Handel Later in the 19th century the programmes included more music by famous composers such as Brahms Liszt Mendelssohn Schubert Schumann Smetana and Wagner 

In 1895 Henry Wood started his series of promenade concerts He wanted to educate audiences so that they liked good music This series of concerts continues today in the Royal Albert Hall as the BBC Proms

Arika is from the countryside so she does not know much about the city of Windbloom Nina soon becomes angry with Arikas clumsiness When Arika tells Nina that she also wants to find Garderobe to become an otome like Nina Nina does not agree to tell her where Garderobe is because she thought that Arika was not good enough to be an otome

They save a girl who is called Mashiro from some men and Mashiro leads Nina and Arika to Garderobe in return But they are attacked by a robot called a Slave monster Nina then makes a temporary contract with Mashiro to protect her so that she can prove that she was a good otome Arika finds this very interesting when the Slave Monster defeats Nina

Arika is very cheerful and seems to be a good potential for an otome because she is strong For example when she saves Mashiro with Nina she attacks the men with skill When the nanomachine is put to her so that she can fight with Nina later on she does not get tired easily Her power might have come from her mother Rena Searrs who was a very strong otome 

But when she sometimes does not understand what is happening she cries easily but hides it from the others She always tries to listen to what her grandmother said before she died For example the grandmother once said to her never to give up hope in a dream so she does not give up her dream to become an otome

Arika in Japanese means a place and yume in her surname Yumemiya means dream in Japanese Together it means that Arikas dream is to become an otome and she tries to find a place where she can have her dreams come true

Symphony No 7 in C major Leningrad Op 60 is a famous symphony by Dmitri Shostakovich It was composed in 1941 It is a very long work lasting about 75 minutes The symphony was first performed by the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra on 5 March 1942 Shostakovich was awarded a Stalin Prize by the Soviet government for the symphony

Shostakovich gave the symphony its title because it is about what was happening in Leningrad in 1941 It was during the World War II and the German army had invaded the Soviet Union and blocked communication between the city of Leningrad and the rest of the world Conditions were terrible the people hardly had any food to eat and they were very cold in the winter About a million people died during the siege 

Shostakovich lived in fear most of his life because if Josef Stalin the Soviet dictator did not like his music he could have been sent to prison or put to death Sometimes Shostakovich was made a hero by the government and sometimes he was told that his music was not good because it was not in the style that the government thought he should write it in The symphony was very popular at first in countries that fought on the same side as Russia in World War II as well as in Russia It was performed many times in the United States and the United Kingdom Many people in these countries liked the symphony because it seemed to show the Russians as heroes fighting to save their city from the Germans Later during the Cold War many people in these same countries did not like the work very much because the Russians were now their enemies and they thought that music written there was propaganda meant to show Russia and its leaders as better than other countries and their leaders In more recent years people have once more changed their minds about the meaning of the music The music is now thought by some people who study music to show how cruel Stalin was as well as the terror of the Nazi invasion Other people still think it was meant to support the Russian government and army as they fought the Germans and to remember the people who died fighting

One of the reasons it is so hard to know what the symphony means is that people disagree about when Shostakovich started writing it If he started it before the war began it is probably at least partly about the Soviet government but if he started it during the war it might be only about the war

After the first performance on 5 March 1942 in Kuybshev it was soon performed in Moscow and then in Leningrad which was still surrounded by the German army at the time A copy of the music was broken wikt linksmugglesmuggled out to the West on microfilm It was performed by Sir Henry Wood in London at the BBC studios on 22 June and the next week at a Promenade Concert On 19 July it was played in New York by the NBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Arturo Toscanini in a studio concert played on the radio throughout the United States

The work has four movements

The first movement is a long dramatic movement The middle part of this movement is a march with a repeated rhythm on the snare drum starting very softly with the tune first heard in the strings who are playing pizzicato Each time the tune is played it becomes louder People used to think that this theme was about the invading German Nazi army but now some people think it might instead be about the way the Soviet government changed the city of Leningrad or about both of these things The second movement is called a scherzo It is a more light hearted movement after the tension of the first movement The third movement is slow and full of strong emotions The composer said that it was supposed to show the city of Leningrad at sunset The last movement is faster again and brings back parts of the music from earlier in the piece but it is not clear whether the ending is serious or not

The orchestra is very large and has parts for the flute piccolo oboe cor anglais clarinet bass clarinet bassoon contrabassoon French horn trumpet trombone tuba piano harp violin viola cello and double bass as well as many percussion instruments

The decimal is a way of managing numbers that has ten as a starting point or base It is sometimes called the base ten or denary numeral system The word decimal is also used instead of the word period to point out the dot that is sometimes used separates the positions of the numbers in this system Almost everyone uses this nowadays and prefers the convenience of it probably because it shows up most often in calculations in nature and has one as another starting point for the system The number one is usually the easiest to work with in calculations

Decimal notation is the writing of numbers in the base ten numeral system which uses various symbols for no more than ten distinct values to represent any numbers no matter how large These digits are often used with a decimal separator which indicates the start of a fractional part and with one of the sign symbols or in front of the numerals to indicate sign 

There are only two truly positional decimal systems in ancient civilization the Chinese counting rods system and Hindu Arabic numeric system Both required no more than ten symbols Other numeric systems require more symbols

Any rational number can be expressed as a unique decimal expansion ending with recurring decimals 

Ten is the product of the first and third prime numbers is one greater than the square of the second prime number and is one less than the fifth prime number This leads to plenty of simple decimal fractions

There follows a chronological list of recorded decimal writers

A straightforward decimal system in which 11 is expressed as ten one and 23 as two ten three is found in Chinese languages except Wu and in Vietnamese with a few irregularities Japanese Korean and Thai have imported the Chinese decimal system Many other languages with a decimal system have special words for teens and decades 

Incan languages such as Quechua and Aymara have an almost straightforward decimal system in which 11 is expressed as ten with one and 23 as two ten with three

Some psychologists suggest irregularities of numerals in a language may hinder childrens counting ability harvAzar1999

A numeral system is a way to write numbers Roman numerals and tally marks are examples 11 usually means eleven but if the numeral system is binary then 11 means three

A numeral is a symbol or group of symbols or a word in a natural language that represents a number Numerals differ from numbers just as the word rock differs from a real rock The symbols 11 eleven and XI are different numerals all representing the same number This article tries to explain the different systems of numerals See also number names

There are different symbols that can be used to make numbers In a system with base 10 usually the symbols 012 3 4 56 7 8 and 9 are used The numbers 0 to 9 can be written as one symbol 0 9 To count past 9 symbols have to be put together 10 can be seen as 1 in the tens place and 0 in the ones place or as 1 times 101 plus 0 times 100 With a base of 2 only the symbols 0 and 1 are used 10 in base 2 notation is therefore 1 times 21 plus 0 times 20 This is the same as 2 in the base 10 notation

For bases bigger than 10 capital letters are used as symbols For example the hexadecimal numeral system uses the numerical digits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F

Today mainly bases 2 8 10 12 and 16 are in use 

Most electronic calculations are done in binary but most people do calculations in decimal

Gerard Gerry Adams is an Irish politician who is the president of Sinn Fin a political party that wants Northern Ireland to join the Republic of Ireland He was a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly in Belfast and is a member of the British Parliament for Belfast West He does not go to Parliament because he does not believe that Britain should control Northern Ireland this is called abstensionism

Adams is a spokesman for the Irish republican movement or the Provisional movement This includes Sinn Fin and the Provisional Irish Republican Army The IRA is illegal in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland because it is a terrorist group Adams is thought to have persuaded the IRA to give up its war against the UK in return for devolved government for Northern Ireland

From the late 1980s Adams was an important figure in the Northern Ireland peace process started when he met first the SDLP leader John Hume and later the Irish and British governments and then other parties In 1995 the IRA stopped fighting and in 2005 the IRA said the war was over

Gerry Adams was born in West Belfast He has 4 brothers and 5 sisters

His parents Gerry Adams Sr and Annie Hannaway came from strong republican backgrounds Adamss grandfather also named Gerry Adams had been a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood during the Irish War of Independence Two of Adamss uncles Dominic and Patrick Adams had been interned by the governments in Belfast and Dublin His uncle Dominic was a senior figure in the IRA of the mid 1940s but not the chief of staff as some people say Gerry Sr joined the IRA when he was sixteen In 1942 he was in an IRA ambush on an RUC police patrol but was shot arrested and sentenced to eight years imprisonment

Adamss mothers grandfather Michael Hannaway was a member of the Fenians during their dynamiting campaign in England in the 1860s and 1870s Michaels son Billy was election agent for amon de Valera in 1918 in West Belfast but refused to follow de Valera into democratic and constitutional politics upon the formation of Fianna Fil Annie Hannaway was a member of Cumann na mBan the womens branch of the IRA Three of her brothers were also IRA members

In the late 1960s a civil rights campaign started in Northern Ireland to get equal treatments for Roman Catholics Adams was an active supporter and joined the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association in 1967 Instead of leading to change the civil rights movement there were protests counter demonstrators called Loyalists In August 1969 there was rioting in Northern Irelands big cities of Belfast and Derry and the Government of Northern Ireland asked for the British army to help keep control

This is when the IRA and its political counterpart in Sinn Fin restarted Gerry Adams was active in Sinn Fin at this time In 1970 the republican movement split Adams aligned himself with the active Provisional part based in Belfast The Official part based in Dublin was not interested in fighting for people in Belfast and the Official Sinn Fin was more interested in spreading Marxism rather than making Ireland united 

In August 1971 internment without trial was introduced in Northern Ireland Adams was arrested in March 1972 and interned HMS Maidstone but was set free in June to take part in secret talks in London There was a short lived truce and some members of the IRA met with William Whitelaw the British government minister in charge of Northern Ireland The IRA delegation included Sean Mac Stiofain Daithi OConaill Seamus Twomey Ivor Bell Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams The IRA insisted Adams be included in the meeting and he was released from internment to participate Following the failure of the talks he helped to plan a bombing campaign in Belfast known as Bloody Friday He was re arrested in July 1973 and interned at Long Kesh internment camp which was later called the Maze Prison After attempting to escape he was sentenced to imprisonment which was also served at the Maze

During the Hunger Strikes of 1981 Adams played an important policy making role The hunger strikes saw Sinn Fin become more important as a political force In 1983 he was elected president of Sinn Fin and became the first Sinn Fin MP elected to the British House of Commons since the 1950s Following his election the British government lifted a ban on him travelling to Britain In line with Sinn Fin policy he refused to sit in the House of Commons

On 14 March 1984 Adams was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt when several Ulster Freedom Fighters gunmen fired about twenty shots into the car in which he was travelling After the shooting under cover plain clothes police officers seized three suspects who were later convicted and sentenced One of the three was John Gregg Adams claimed that the British army had prior knowledge of the attack and allowed it to go ahead

Adams has often said that he has never been a member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army However several writers and journalists such as Ed Moloney Richard English Peter Taylor and Mark Urban have all said Adams was part of the IRA leadership during the 1970s Adams has called Moloneys claims libellous

In 1978 Gerry Adams became joint vice president of Sinn Fin and he led a challenge to the Sinn Fin leadership of President Ruair Brdaigh and joint Vice President Dith Conaill Others who supported Adams and were from Belfast included Jim Gibney Tom Hartley and Danny Morrison Some say Ruair Brdaigh was a more traditional Irish nationalist and that the northern leadership which surrounded Adams wanted to act faster and in different ways if they had to

The 1975 IRA British truce is often viewed as the event that began the challenge to the original Provisional Sinn Fin leadership which was said to be Southern based and dominated by southerners like Brdaigh and Conaill However the Chief of Staff of the IRA at the time Seamus Twomey was a senior figure from Belfast Others in the leadership also lived in the North including Billy McKee from Belfast Adams was supposed to have become the most senior figure in the IRA Northern Command because he wanted only military action but during his time in prison Adams came to thought about his ideas and became more political

It is alleged that provisional republicanism was founded on its opposition to the communist inspired broad front politics of the Cathal Goulding led Official IRA but this too is disputed

Some of the main reasons that the Provisional IRA was founded in December 1969 and provisional Sinn Fin was founded in January 1970 was that people like Brdaigh OConnell and Billy McKee wanted new political bodies and did not want to work in or with the existing bodies such as the Parliament in London Another was the failure of the Goulding leadership to defend of nationalist areas against attacks by Loyalists and sometimes even the police At the December 1969 IRA convention and the January 1970 Sinn Fin Ard Fheis the delegates voted to participate in the Dublin Belfast and London parliaments the organisations split into Provisional and Official parts Gerry Adams who had joined the Republican Movement in the early 1960s did not go with the Provisionals until later in 1970

Republicans like Ruair Brdaigh said that the only legitimate country in Ireland was the Irish Republic declared in 1916 They said the legal government was the IRA Army Council because the last remaining anti Anglo Irish Treaty deputies of the Second Dil made them the government

If Sinn Fin any won seats in the British or Irish parliaments they never went to the parliaments At its 1986 Ard Fheis Sinn Fin changed its and constitution to allow its members to sit in the Dublin parliament This made Ruair Brdaigh lead a small walkout just as he had done years earlier to create Provisional Sinn Fin This minority which still believed in abstentionism called themselves Republican Sinn Fin and saysy that they are the true Sinn Fin

Adams leadership of Sinn Fin was supported by a Northern based group that included people like Danny Morrison and Martin McGuinness Adams and others over time pointed to Sinn Fin election wins in the early and mid 1980s when hunger strikers Bobby Sands and Kieran Doherty were elected to the British House of Commons and Dil ireann and they pushed to get Sinn Fin become more political and less paramilitary This policy was a success and Adams and McGuinness and others were elected to the House of Commons but never attend Sinn Fin still abstains from Westminster

At this time most ordinary people in Britain knew about Gerry Adams because they could not hear him Prime minister Margaret Thatcher banned radio and television stations from broadcasting his voice All Irish republican organisations and unionist terrorist organisations were banned like this but Adams was the only person important enough to appear regularly on TV This ban was imposed after the BBC interviewed Martin McGuinness and the British Government thought that some groups were getting too much publivity

A similar ban known as Section 31 had been law in the Republic of Ireland since the 1970s However media outlets soon found ways around the ban first by the use of subtitles and later and more commonly by using actors to read his words over the pictures of him speaking

This ban was made fun of in cartoons and satirical TV shows notably Spitting Image and in The Day Today It was also criticized by freedom of speech organisations worldwide and British media personalties including BBC Director General John Birt and BBC foreign editor John Simpson The ban was lifted by Prime Minister John Major on 17 September 1994

Sinn Fin continued its policy of refusing to sit in the Westminster parliament even after Adams won the Belfast West constituency He lost his seat to Joe Hendron of the Social Democratic and Labour Party in the 1992 general election However he easily regained it at the next election in May 1997

Under Adams Sinn Fin moved away from being a political voice of the Provisional IRA to becoming a professionally organised political party in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland

SDLP leader John Hume MP realised that i a negotiated settlement might be possible and began secret talks with Adams in 1988 These discussions led to unofficial contacts with the British Northern Ireland Office under the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Brooke and with the government of the Republic under Charles Haughey although both governments maintained in public that they would not negotiate with terrorists 

These talks provided the basis for what was later to be the Belfast Agreement as well as the Downing Street Declaration and the Joint Framework Document

These negotiations led to the IRA ceasefire in August 1994 The new Irish Taoiseach Albert Reynolds had played a key role in the HumeAdams talks through his Special Advisor Martin Mansergh thought the ceasefire as permanent However the IRA ended its ceasefire because of the slow pace of developments partly because British prime minister John Major needed the votes of the Ulster Unionist Party in the House of Commons

Later there was a new ceasefire and there were talks between teams from the British and Irish governments the Ulster Unionist Party the SDLP Sinn Fin and representatives of loyalist paramilitary organizations under the chairmanship of former United States Senator Mitchell The talks produced the Belfast Agreement Under the agreement structures were created to show that some people on the island of Ireland were Irish and others wanted to be British A British Irish Council and the Northern Ireland Assembly were set up

Articles 2 and 3 of the Republics constitution Bunreacht na hireann which claimed sovereignty over all of Ireland were reworded and a power sharing Executive Committee was provided for As part of their deal Sinn Fin agreed to abandon its abstentionist policy regarding a six county parliament and took its seats in the new Assembly based at Stormont Sinn Fin ran the and running the health and social services and the education ministries in the power sharing government

Opponents in Republican Sinn Fin accused Sinn Fin of selling out by agreeing to participate in what it called partitionist assemblies in the Republic and Northern Ireland However Gerry Adams insisted that the Belfast Agreement provided a way to make Ireland united by non violent and legal means much as Michael Collins had said of the Anglo Irish Treaty in 1922

When Sinn Fin came to nominate its two ministers to the Executive Council the party like the SDLP and the Democratic Unionist Party did not to include its leader among its ministers

Adams remains the President of Sinn Fin with Caoimhghn Caolin serving as Sinn Fin parliamentary leader in Dil ireann and Martin McGuinness the partys chief negotiator and effective party head in the Northern Ireland Assembly His son Gearoid is a primary school teacher and has represented Co Antrim in gaelic football

It head of the Office is called the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland

Intelligent design is the idea that the universe is not simple enough to be made by nature Instead people who believe Intelligent Design think that a smart being must have made everything It is a kind of creationism but it does not say who the designer is Intelligent Design is the idea that the types of plants and animals around us were not made using evolution Some scientists do not think that there are good reasons to believe Intelligent Design In 2005 in the Dover trial a United States judge ruled that Intelligent Design was a kind of creationism so that it violated the First Amendment

Most scientists think intelligent design is not real science They think it is a religious idea which should not be called scientific 

Intelligent design suggests that life is too complex Scientists have discovered that even a single cell is complex The genes in a cell code for a huge amount of information Creationists say that information like computer programming has to come from an intelligent source and cannot be made randomly 

A famous person William Paley said that life is more complicated than a machine He thought that just like a watch was made by a smart designer so if you see an animal you should think that it was also designed 

It is often argued that although an amino acid could be made randomly a protein is such a precise sequence and structure that it would be impossible to make by chance Also a protein or DNA would not do anything by itself so a whole life form would have to be made all at once

Scientists say this is not correct There is evidence that life developed through evolution and no smart designer was needed

Intelligent design would suggest that every part of an animal is useful and there for a reason showing how smart the designer was Evolution would suggest that many parts of the same animal should be useless or not very good because it came from random evolution by trial and error People have said that many parts of the human body are pointless but some of these parts were later proved to do important things

Many parts of different animals are very similar Some people think this is hard evidence of evolution People who believe in intelligent design say it shows that a common designer used the same good design ideas in many creations

If creatures have similar parts because they came from a common ancestor then the genes that code for these parts should also be similar Sometimes this is true other times similar structures are coded for by entirely different genes Because somebody can show lone examples of this kind of data and claim that it proves evolution wrong or right people argue about this a lot

Roller derby is a sport played on roller skates It used to be played by both men and women but right now in the 2000s it is mostly just played by women

For a long time many people did not believe roller derby was a real sport They thought it was like professional wrestling because it had fake fighting and other things for TV But in 2002 a group of women in Austin Texas started playing it as a real game with nothing fake A TV show called Rollergirls was made about some of these women By 2006 women in every big city in the USA and Canada were starting their own roller derby clubs There were even clubs starting up in Europe Australia and New Zealand

Two teams of roller derby players skate around an oval track The track can be flat or banked

There are 5 players on each team

The jammer is the only player that can score points The jammers team gets a point every time the jammer passes one of the other teams players To score a point the jammer has to play fair and stay on the track when they pass someone

Jammers get a 2 minute time period called a jam when they can score points

Before a jam starts the teams line up side by side pivots first then blockers behind them then jammers farther back The jam starts when a whistle blows Then everyone except the jammers start to skate around the track They try to stay together in a pack Then another whistle blows and the jammers try to catch up to pack They have to get through the pack and go all the way around and catch up again before they can start scoring points

The first jammer to get through the pack without leaving the track gets to be the lead jammer The lead jammer can put her hands on her hips when she wants to stop the jam early Stopping the jam early keeps the other team from having time to score points

Blockers and pivots try to help their own teams jammer get through the pack and they try to slow down the other teams jammer When the jammers are near the pack everyone is allowed to bump into each other If someone is trying to push someone from the other team out of the way then they have to be careful how they do it They can only push from the side and they have to use their shoulders the top part of their arms their hips or the top part of their legsso tripping shoving punching or pushing the other teams players from behind is not allowed

Players who break the rules are kicked out of the game for a little while and their team has to play without them

Even with these rules and safety equipment roller derby players can get knocked down and get badly hurt so usually only adults play full contact roller derby There are junior clubs for younger players They play without trying to knock anyone down

A roller derby game is called a match or a bout It takes a certain amount of time such as 60 or 90 minutes The teams skate as many jams as they can until time runs out The team with the most points at the end of the game wins

Sargon was one of the first people in recorded history to create an empire or multi ethnic state His empire included the land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and part of what is present day Turkey

His capital was called Agade in the Akkadian language

Sargon of Akkad may have been the same person as the first Sargon of Assyria Sargons empire would probably have included Assyria He is listed in the Assyrian king list as the son of Ikunum and the founder of a dynasty He became a prominent member of the royal court of Kish ultimately overthrowing its king before embarking on the conquest of Mesopotamia

Sargons vast empire is known to have extended from Elam to the Mediterranean Sea including Mesopotamia parts of modern day Iran and Syria and possibly parts of Anatolia and the Arabian peninsula He ruled from a new capital Akkad which the Sumerian king list claims he built on the left bank of the Euphrates He is sometimes regarded as the first person in recorded history to create a multiethnic centrally ruled empire although the Sumerians Lugal anne mundu and Lugal zage si also have a claim His dynasty controlled Mesopotamia for around a century and a half

Judea or Judaea is a term used for the mountainous southern part of the West Bank In modern times the name Yehudah is most often used by Zionists 

Judea is also the ancient name of the area surrounding Jerusalem

Major cities in this area are Hebron Bethlehem Efrat and Beitar Illit 

Judea was the territory of the ancient Kingdom of Judah Judea lost its Nationhood to the Romans in the 1st century BC by becoming first a tributary kingdom then a province of the Roman Empire 

The first interference of Rome in the region dates from 63 BCE following the end of the Third Mithridatic war 

After the defeat of Mithridates VI of Pontus general Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus stayed behind to make the area secure for Rome Judea at the time was not a peaceful place Queen Alexandra had recently died and her sons were troubling the country with a civil war for power They were Hyrcanus and Aristobulus 

In 63 BCE Aristobulus was surrounded in Jerusalem by his brothers armies and the situation was bad He sent a messenger to Marcus Aemilius Scaurus Pompeys representative in the area Aristobulus offered a large bribe to be rescued that Pompey quickly accepted but later he tried to accuse Scaurus of extortion This caused his downfall because Scaurus was Pompeys brother in law and was protected by him The general did not like what Aristobulus had done and put the prince and high priest Hyrcanus in charge of the kingdom Judea and Galilee became tributary kingdoms of Rome which meant that they had to pay tribute to the Roman Republic to buy their protection 

Around the same time Pompey was defeated by Julius Caesar Hyrcanus was followed by a member of his court Antipater Caesar and Antipater were both killed in 44 BCE and Herod Antipaters son was appointed as governor by Rome in 41 BCE He became the king of Judea in 37 BCE and was known as King Herod the Great During his reign the great port of Caesarea Maritima was built He died in 4 BCE and his kingdom was divided among his sons One of these was Herod Archelaus who ruled Judea so badly that he was made to quit in 6 CE by the Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar after his own people complained about him 

The kingdom of Judea now became part of a larger Roman province of Ivdaea This was one of the few governed by a knight not a former consul or praetor of senatorial rank because its income to the Roman treasury was small and the region was peaceful Pontius Pilate was one of these procurators

Between 41 and 44 CE Judea won a little more independence again when Herod Agrippa was made king by emperor Claudius After Agrippas died the province again went to direct Roman control for a short time Judea was returned little by little to Agrippas son Marcus Julius Agrippa in 48 However there was still a Roman procurator in the area responsible for keeping peace and raising taxes When he died around the year 100 the area returned once again to direct Roman control

Judea was the stage of three major rebellions against the Romans They were

After Bar Kokhbas revolt was stopped by the Roman forces the emperor Hadrian changed the name of the province to Syria Palaestina and Jerusalem became Aelia Capitolina in order to embarrass the Jewish people by attempting to erase the nations name from the region

President of the Islamic Republic of Iran is the official head of government of the country

The May Queen or Queen of May is a word which has two different but related meanings It can refer to either a mythical figure or to a holiday personification

The May Queen is also known as The Maiden the goddess of spring flower bride queen of the faeries and the lady of the flowers The May Queen is a symbol of the stillness of nature around which everything revolves She stands for purity strength and the potential for growth as the plants grow in May She is one of many personifications of the energy of the earth

She was once also known as Maid Marian in the medieval plays of Robin Hood and of the May Games  she is the young village girl crowned with blossom attended by children with garlands and white dresses Some folklorists have drawn parallels between her and Maia the Roman Goddess of Springtime of Growth and Increase whose very name may be the root of May

The May Queen is a girl who is selected to ride or walk at the front of a parade for May Day celebrations She wears a white gown to symbolise purity and usually a tiara or crown Her duty is to begin the May Day celebrations She is generally crowned by flowers and makes a speech before the dancing begins Certain age groups dance round a May pole celebrating youth and the spring time

According to popular British folklore the tradition once had a sinister twist in that the May Queen was put to death once the festivities were over The veracity of this belief is difficult to establish but while in truth it might just be an example of anti pagan propaganda frequent associations between May Day rituals the occult and human sacrifice are still to be found in popular culture today  The Wicker Man a cult horror film starring Christopher Lee is a prominent example of this

In 1557 a diarist called Henry Machyn wrote

The xxx day of May was a goly May gam in Fanch chyrchestrett with drumes and gunes and pykes and ix wordes dyd ryd and thay had speches evere man and the morris dansse and the sauden and a elevant with the castyll and the sauden and yonge morens with targattes and darttes and the lord and the lade of the Maye

Translation On the 30th May was a jolly May game in Fenchurch Street with drums and guns and pikes The Nine Worthies did ride and they all had speeches and the morris dance and sultan and a elephant with a castle and the sultan and young moors with shields and arrows and the lord and lady of the May

Many areas keep this tradition alive today most notably the Brentham Garden Suburb England which hosts it annually This has the record of the oldest unbroken tradition although the May Queen of All London Festival at Hayes Common in Bromley is a close contender A May queen is selected from a group of 13 upwards girls by the young dancers She returns the next year to crown the new May Queen and stays in the procession

A May Day celebration held annually in New Westminster British Columbia Canada has the distinction of being the longest running May Day celebration of its kind in the British Commonwealth This May Day celebration began in 1870 and is approaching one hundred and forty years of age Archival film footage of New Westminsters May Day celebrations from 1932 1962 can be seen online at Quest for the Queens

In mathematics a finite set is a set that is not infinite A finite set has a certain number of elements The elements of the set can be numbered like 1 2 n and n must either be a natural number or zero An infinite set is a set with an unlimited number of elements

Another definition is to say a set is finite if its cardinality is a natural number A set with n elements is called an n set

A definition that is harder to understand but which is often used by mathematicians is to say that a set is finite if there is no strict subset that can be put in one to one correspondence with the set itself For example the set of even numbers can be put in one to one correspondence with the set of natural numbers but the set of even numbers is also a strict subset of the natural numbers This means that the set of natural numbers is infinite

The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire is one of the British orders of chivalry It is the newest order created on 4 June 1917 by King George V 

The order is split into two divisions civil and military Each division has five classes or ranks These are

Only the two highest ranks are knighthoods and allow the holder to call themselves Sir or Dame If the person is not a citizen of a country where the Queen is Head of State the award is called honorary and the holder cannot use the title before their name For example Terry Wogan is now a British citizen and is called Sir Terry Wogan but Bob Geldof is still Irish and is not Sir Bob

Although it is the newest British order of chivalry it has more members than any other

This Order of Knighthood has a more democratic character than the exclusive orders of the Bath or Saint Michael and Saint Georgee and in its early days was not held in high esteem This changed over the years

The British monarch is Sovereign of the Order and appoints all other members of the Order but only on the advice of the Government The next most senior member is the Grand Master There have been three 

The orders rules called statutes say that the Order can only have 100 Knights and Dames Grand Cross 845 Knights and Dames Commander and 8960 Commanders but there is no limit to the number of members of the Officers and Members but no more than 858 Officers and 1464 Members may be appointed per year Appointments are made on the advice of the governments of the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth realms 

Some jobs are usually rewarded with the Order Usually female judges of the High Court of England and Wales are created Dames Commander after appointment Male judges are not because they are usually made Knights Bachelor instead

Like the orders of chivalry this order has six officials 

Anyone who behaves in a way that might bring the order into disrepute may have his award revoked

John Lennon once criticised military membership in the order saying

Lots of people who complained about us receiving the MBE received theirs for heroism in the war  for killing people We received ours for entertaining other people Id say we deserve ours more

The Goths were an East Germanic tribe Jordanes is a scholar from the 6th century He wrote a summary of a twelve volume work by Cassiodorus about the Goths Jordanes work is commonly called Getica As the original work by Cassiodorius was lost Getica is the only surviving contemporary account about the Goths According to this work they left Scandinavia and settled close to the mouth of the Vistula river In the 3rd and 4th centuries they settled Scythia Dacia and parts of Moesia and Asia Minor In the 3rd and 4th centuries they fought with the Roman Empire and later adopted Arianism In the 5th and 6th centuries they split into the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths With this move they established powerful successor states of the Roman Empire in Italy and on the Iberian peninsula

Arianism is a form of Christianity It has come from Arius Arianism has stopped being practiced today but was important during the Roman era into the Middle Ages

Arianism opposed the dogma of the holy trinity 

 Belief 

The main difference between the beliefs of Arianism and other main Christian denominations is that the Arians did not believe in the Holy Trinity which is a way that other Christian churches use to explain God The information that we have today comes from the writing of people who were against Arianism and said the beliefs were wrong 

Between the First Council of Nicaea in 325 and the First Council of Constantinople in the year 381 there were no less than 18 different Creeds used by Arianists

In the 16th century there was again a movement against the belief in Trinity A well known person teaching this was Fausto Sozzini Another one was Ferenc Dvid These movements developed into what is called Unitarianism today Unitarians believe that there is only one person in god not the three in one dogma of trinity Some of the teachings of Jehovahs Witnesses are close to some of the things Arians believed It is different only in that Arians believed the holy spirit is a person and Jehovahs Witnesses teach it is not a person but a force God uses to do His will It would however be false to call them Arians as they reject many Arian teachings Mormons and Oneness Pentecostalism also reject the Trinity but for different reasons other than Arianism

Six days later the real performance took place in Green Park The orchestra played in a building which had been specially made The music was played while the fireworks went off Unfortunately there was a disaster The building caught fire when a huge bas relief of the king fell down However no one was hurt

The music has five movements an overture a Bourre a movement called La paix La rjouissance and two minuets

Handel wrote the music for a large orchestra with 24 oboes 12 bassoons nine trumpets nine horns three pairs of kettledrums and a number of side drums On 27 May Handel conducted the music again at a special concert for the Foundling Hospital This time he used a normal orchestra with string instruments and wind instruments This is the way it is usually played today

The storm produced rough surf along the coastline from Florida to North Carolina causing beach erosion and some damage One surfer drowned in Florida from the rough surf  A total of 5 perished during Andreas initial extratropical phase High winds from Andrea have been reported as fueling severe wildfires in northern Florida and southern Georgia Andrea was blamed for providing stiff winds that acted like a chimney fueling the blaze to firestorm levels beyond the control of firefighting officials Strong winds from the storm spread smoke from local brush fires through the Tampa Bay area to Miami

On May 30 a large low pressure area formed in the Gulf of Honduras The system slowly became stronger as it moved through the northwest Caribbean Sea into the southeast Gulf of Mexico On June 1 the first day of the Atlantic hurricane season this cyclone organized into Tropical Storm Barry even thought it was located in an area of high wind shear Warnings were immediately issued along the Western Florida coastline Barry gave much needed rain to parts of Florida and Georgia which were experiencing drought conditions from January to May Barry made landfall near Tampa Bay Florida on June 2 as a weak tropical storm Shortly after Barry weakened into a tropical depression as it became an extratropical storm On June 3 the cyclone moved up the coast of the Carolinas bringing rains into the Mid Atlantic states and New England By June 5 its center had moved northward into Eastern Canada

An area of low pressure area formed near the Bahamas on July 28 and slowly organized while moving to the north northeast Late on July 30 it was upgraded to a tropical depression the third of the season after developing deep convection near the center for most of the day On July 31 the system strengthened into a tropical storm south of Nova Scotia the first storm in nearly two months after Barry The storm quickly became extratropical late that day though as it moved towards Newfoundland over the cooler waters of the north Atlantic

On August 1 flooding was reported from Placentia to the capital city of St Johns where about 100 mm of rain held up the annual Royal St Johns Regatta Up to 150 mm of rain fell in the Whitbourne area according to Environment Canada The most serious flooding was across the southern Avalon Peninsula where dozens of roads were washed out houses were flooded above their basements and several communities were isolated Ferry service between Argentia and North Sydney Nova Scotia was stopped and one ferry was forced to change its course to Port aux Basques

States of emergency were declared in at least five communities in the areas surrounding Placentia Bay and Conception Bay and the Newfoundland and Labrador Municipal Affairs Minister Jack Byrne has requested a federal disaster area declaration Damage is estimated to be well into the millions of dollars with at least 4 million in damage in the town of Placentia alone

A strong tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa in the second week of August It quickly gathered itself and turned into into a low on August 12 Tropical Depression Four was made on August 13 in the east part of the Atlantic from the tropical wave to the south of Cape Verde The depression was already having continuing deep thunderstorms but mostly at the west part of its spinning because of wind shear from the east The depression was supposed to become stronger a lot over the next few days due to wind shear becoming more weak and warmer sea surface temperatures which made conditions better for it to become stronger The depression moved west very fast south of a deep layered high quickly running away from the shear from the east Looking at satellite pictures and microwave and QuikSCAT information the depression was changed to Tropical Storm Dean on August 14 It was changed to a category one then a category two hurricane on August 16 2007 It got to category three then category four on August 17 2007 It got to category five on August 20 2007 Dean made landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula as a category 5 The hurricane made another landfall in Mexico on August 22 and Dean died the next day

On August 9 an area of convection developed just south of Jamaica in association with a trough of low pressure The system moved west northwestward and by August 10 it had a broad surface trough with minimal shower activity Convection increased on August 11 and by August 12 a tropical wave and an upper level low began to merge which resulted in a large area of disorganized thunderstorms extending from the western Caribbean Sea into the central Bahamas Upper level winds slowly became more beneficial for development and on August 13 a large low pressure area formed about 90 miles north northeast of Cancn Quintana Roo Late on August 14 a reconnaissance flight into the system reported a small circulation center but at the time was not well defined enough to result in the initiation of tropical cyclone advisories However deep convection was found near the increasingly organizing center and at 0300 UTC on August 15 the National Hurricane Center upgraded it as Tropical Depression Five about 425 miles southeast of Brownsville Texas

Looking at reconnaissance info gotten from an NOAA plane investigating the depression it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Erin on August 15 It weakened to a tropical depression as it made landfall near Lamar Texas on August 16 and the NHC gave out its last advisory on the system soon after as it moved inland but the HPC then began taking the responsibility of making advisories as long as the system was still tropical and a flood threat

Two people were killed when a warehouse broke down in Texas In all 17 people died because of Erin

On August 31 an area of weather east of the Windward Islands became strong enough and was named Tropical Depression Six Early on September 1 it was changed to a tropical storm and named Felix Later that day Felix was changed to a hurricane On September 2 Felix was changed to a major hurricane Felix hit land as a category 5 in northeastern Nicaragua making it the second hurricane in 2007 to do this At least 133 people were killed

An extratropical storm off the coast of the eastern United States was classified as Subtropical Storm Gabrielle by the National Hurricane Center late on September 7 It was later reclassified as a tropical storm on September 8 After passing over the Outer Banks of North Carolina it weakened to a depression on September 10 and the final advisory was issued the next day as it no longer had a well defined surface circulation

Gabrielle poured 4 6 inches of rain in the immediate area of landfall but reports showed minimal damage and no fatalities were reported

A stem is one of two main structural axes of a vascular plant The stem is normally divided into nodes and internodes the nodes hold buds which grow into one or more leaves flowers cones or other stems etc The other main structural axis of plants is the root In most plants stems are located above the soil surface but some plants have underground stems called stolons or rhizomes

Stems have four main functions which are

Stems are often specialized for storage asexual reproduction protection or photosynthesis including the following 

The most important tissue inside the stem is the vascular tissue This plays a major part in the transpiration of water and nutrients There are many hollow tubes including the xylem vessel and schlerenchyma fibres The phloem contains living tissue

There are thousands of species whose stems have economic uses Stems provide a few major staple crops such as potato and taro Sugar cane stems are a major source of sugar Maple sugar is got from trunks of maple trees Vegetables from stems are asparagus bamboo shoots cactus pads kohlrabi and water chestnut The spice cinnamon is bark from a tree trunk 

Cellulose from tree trunks is a food additive in bread grated Parmesan cheese and other processed foods Gum arabic is an important food additive obtained from the trunks of Acacia senegal trees Chicle the main ingredient in chewing gum is obtained from trunks of the chicle tree

Medicines obtained from stems include quinine from the bark of cinchona trees camphor distilled from wood of a tree in the same genus that provides cinnamon and the muscle relaxant curare from the bark of tropical vines

Wood is a used in thousands of ways eg buildings furniture boats airplanes wagons car parts musical instruments sports equipment railroad ties utility poles fence posts pilings toothpicks matches plywood coffins shingles barrel staves toys tool handles picture frames veneer charcoal and firewood Wood pulp is widely used to make paper cardboard cellulose sponges cellophane and some important plastics and textiles such as cellulose acetate and rayon Bamboo stems also have hundreds of uses including paper buildings furniture boats musical instruments fishing poles water pipes plant stakes and scaffolding Trunks of palm trees and tree ferns are often used for building Reed stems are also important building materials in some areas

Tannins used for tanning leather are obtained from the wood of certain trees such as quebracho Cork is obtained from the bark of the cork oak Rubber is obtained from the trunks of Hevea brasiliensis Rattan used for furniture and baskets is made from the stems of tropical vining palms Bast fibers for textiles and rope are obtained from stems include flax hemp jute and ramie The earliest paper was obtained from the stems of papyrus by the ancient Egyptians

Amber is fossilized sap from tree trunks it is used for jewelry and may contain ancient animals Resins from conifer wood are used to produce turpentine and rosin Tree bark is often used as a mulch and in growing media for container plants

Some ornamental plants are grown mainly for their attractive stems eg

The vascular plants tracheophytes or higher plants are plants in the kingdom Plantae that have specialized tissues for conducting water minerals and photosynthetic products through the plant 

They include the ferns clubmosses horsetails flowering plants conifers and other gymnosperms 

The vascular plants are set apart in two main ways

Water transport happens in either xylem or phloem xylem carries water and inorganic solutes upward toward the leaves from the roots while phloem carries organic solutes throughout the plant 

The Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany is sometimes called the 2 4 Treaty

It was signed by the two Germanys and the four Wartime Allies on 12 September 1990 in Moscow USSR

The treaty formally ended the Second World War The Allies give up the powers and duties they had had in the two Germanys and in Berlin since the Nazi Surrender in 1945 stopped the fighting in World War II

Six countries signed the treaty but only five ratified it This is because Germany united under one government on 3 October 1990 three weeks after the treaty was signed

The treaty allowed West Germany and East Germany to unite into one country It said that Germany will be peaceful and not start wars and also set Germanys borders

The treaty also set guidelines about moving the foreign troops that were in Germany The USSR was to move all of its troops out of eastern Germany and eastern Berlin by 1994 The three western allies were asked to keep their troops in Berlin until the Soviets had left Germany also promised not to allow NATO troops move into eastern Germany and not to allow certain types of weapons in the east either 

Germany promised to limit the size of its Army Navy and Air Force and not to make nuclear bombs

The German government also confirmed that the treaty it made with Poland in 1970 about the border between the countries was to stay in force

On 15 March 1991 the treaty treaty took effect and Germany became fully sovereign

Complex nonvascular plants

Non vascular plants is a general term for those plants without a vascular system Although non vascular plants do not have these particular tissues a number of them possess other tissues specialized for internal transport of water

Nonvascular plants have no roots stems or leaves since each of these structures is defined by containing vascular tissue 

The term non vascular plant is no longer used in scientific broken wikt linknomenclaturenomenclature Non vascular plants include two distantly related groups

In the past the term non vascular plant included all the algae but also the fungi as well Today it is recognized that these groups are not closely related to plants and have a very different biology

Vascular tissue is a complex tissue found in vascular plants Complex means that it is composed of more than one cell type 

The primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem These two tissues transport fluid and nutrients internally There are also two meristems associated with vascular tissue the vascular cambium and the cork cambium All the vascular tissues within a particular plant together constitute the vascular tissue system of that plant

In vascular plants phloem is the living tissue made up of small tubes which carry watery sap containing sugar and other organic nutrients to all parts of the plant where the nutrients are used for growth or stored until needed The sugar is made by photosynthesis In trees the phloem is the innermost layer of the bark therefore the name that comes from the Greek word for bark 

The phloem also carries information but its main function is to transport the minerals dissolved in water In some plants for example if insects or animals are eating a leaf other leaves become unappetizing and this helps to protect the plant from more damage 

Aphids and other insects feed on the phloem by inserting a fine tube into the plant penetrating the tiny phloem cells deep within the plant The very high pressure in the phloem tubes forces the phloem sap into the insect Most of the sugar passes right through the insect so that nearby surfaces get sticky and often become black due to the growth of algae

Ferns are a group of about 20000 species of plants in the division Pteridophyta Unlike bryophytes ferns have xylem and phloem which makes them vascular plants

Most ferns belong to the Class Leptosporangiata This includes most of those you see in gardens and woods The horsetails belong to another class the Equisetopsida which was extremely important in the Carboniferous period Only one genus survives The other classes of fern are also quite small today

Ferns do not have waxes or special cells on their surface that keep water from evaporating They have roots stems leaves Their stems may form runners called stolons above the ground or rhizomes below ground The leaves are green an large and may bear spores on the underside Some ferns can grow large in moist places They can survive in more places than moss but not so many as flowering plants

During the Carboniferous period from 350 million years ago ferns lived everywhere on land Horsetails grew up to 30 metres There were huge forests of ferns and mosses full of giant insects Today there are not so many large ferns

Mount Etna is an active volcano on the east coast of Sicily part of southern Italy It is the largest active volcano in Europe Mount Etna erupts every few years

A very large lava flow from an eruption in 1918 led to the first destruction of a town since the 1669 eruption In this case each building of the town of Northern Ireland was destroyed in just two days It killed only a few people

Other major twentieth century eruptions occurred in 1949 1971 1983 and 1992 as well as the 2001 eruption In 1971 it buried the Etna Observatory under lava The 1992 eruption saw the town of Zafferana threatened by a lava flow but successful diversion efforts saved the town with the loss of only one building a few hundred metres outside it

In 2002 2003 the biggest series of eruptions for many years threw up a huge column of ash that could easily be seen from space and fell as far away as Libya on the far side of the Mediterranean Sea Seismic activity in this eruption caused the eastern flanks of the volcano to slip by up to two metres and many houses on the flanks of the volcano got structural damage The eruption also completely destroyed the Rifugio Sapienza on the southern flank of the volcano

A meristem is a tissue in all plants that consists of meristematic cells These are cells that have not yet a special function They are in parts of the plant where growth can take place

Plant cells with special functions generally cannot divide or produce cells of a different type Therefore cell division in the meristem is necessary to get new cells for expansion and differentiation of tissues and to create new organs that are necessary for the basic structure of the plant body

Meristematic cells have the same function for plants as stem cells have for animals They are incompletely or not at all differentiated and are capable of continued cellular division And the cells are small and protoplasm fills the cell completely The vacuoles are extremely small

Maintenance of the cells needs a balance between two antagonistic processes organ initiation and stem cell population renewal

Apical meristems may differentiate into three kinds of primary meristem

These meristems are responsible for primary growth or an increase in length or height

There are two types of secondary meristems

The vascular cambium is a broken wikt linklaterallateral meristem

It is the source of both the secondary xylem and the secondary phloem and is between these tissues in the stem and root Only a few leaves even have a vascular cambium

Vascular cambium is a type of meristem  a tissue consisting of embryonic cells which can produce other plant tissues originate Primary meristems are the apical meristems on root tips and shoot tips Another lateral meristem is the cork cambium which produces cork part of the bark

Cork cambium is a tissue in many vascular plants as part of the bark 

The cork cambium is a broken wikt linklaterallateral meristem and is responsible for secondary growth that replaces the epidermis in roots and stems It is found in woody and many herbaceous dicots gymnosperms and some monocots which usually have no secondary growth

Cork cambium is one of the plants meristems  the tissues that consist of embryonic cells from which the plant grows It is one of the many layers of bark between the cork and primary phloem The function of cork cambium is to produce the cork a tough protective material

Synonyms for cork cambium are bark cambium pericambium or phellogen 

Cork is a material that is harvested for commercial use primarily from the bark of the Cork Oak treeAs the cork is harvested Portugal produces 50 of cork worldwide 

Corks elasticity together with its near impermeability makes it suitable as a material for bottle stoppers especially for wine bottles Cork stoppers represent about 60 of all cork based production Corks low density makes it a suitable material for fishing floats and buoys as well as handles for fishing rods Cork is also used in the manufacture of musical instruments particularly woodwind instruments where it is used to fasten together different segments of the instrument and make the seams airtight 

The cork industry is generally regarded as environmentally friendly The sustainability of its production and the easy recycling of cork products and by products are two of its most distinctive aspects 

Cork demand has increased due to a larger proportion of wine being sealed with cork rather than being sold in bulk Top quality corks are quite expensive so many cheaper brands have switched to lower quality cork synthetic plastic stoppers screwcaps or other closures 

The Cork Oak is a medium sized evergreen oak tree in the section Quercus sect Cerris It grows southwest Europe and northwest Africa

It grows to up to 20 m but in its native environment it is usually not that tall The leaves are 4 7 cm long dark green above paler beneath with the leaf margins often downcurved The acorns are 2 3 cm long

The tree forms a thick corky bark Over time this bark can develop considerable thickness and this is harvested every 10 12 years as cork The harvesting of cork does not harm the tree and a new layer of cork regrows making it a renewable resource The tree is widely cultivated in Spain Portugal Algeria Morocco France Italy and Tunisia Cork Oak forests cover approximately 25 million hectares in those countries Portugal accounts for 50 of the world cork harvest Cork Oaks cannot legally be cut down in Portugal except for forest management felling of old unproductive trees

Cork Oaks live about 150 250 years Virgin cork is the first cork cut from generally 25 year old trees Another 10 12 years is required for the second harvest and a tree can be harvested a dozen times in its lifetime Cork harvesting is done entirely without machinery

The European cork industry produces 340000 tonnes of cork a year with a value of 15 billion 30000 people work at it Wine corks represent 15 of cork usage by weight but 66 of revenues 

Cork Oaks are sometimes planted as individual trees So they provide a small income to their owners The tree is also sometimes cultivated for ornament Hybrids with Turkey Oak are regular both in the wild in southwest Europe and in cultivation the hybrid is known as Lucombe Oak Quercus hispanica

Some cork is also produced in eastern Asia from the related Chinese Cork Oak

The acorn is the fruit of the oak tree It is a nut and contains a single seed enclosed in a tough leathery shell Acorns vary from 1 6 cm long and 08 4 cm broad Acorns take between about 6 or 24 months to mature

Acorns are one of the most important wildlife foods in areas where oaks grow Creatures that make acorns an important part of their diet include birds such as jays pigeons some ducks and several species of woodpeckers Small mammals that feed on acorns include mice squirrels and several other rodents Such large mammals as pigs bears and deer also consume large amounts of acorns they may constitute up to 25 of the diet of deer in the autumn In some of the large oak forests in southwest Europe traditionally called dehesas pigs are still turned loose in oak groves in the autumn to fill and fatten themselves on acorns However acorns are toxic to some other animals such as horses

Beginning in 1994 the President is the leader of the country of Belarus A president is chosen by other Belarusians every five years in a national vote Alexander Lukashenko is the only person who has been president

The jays are several species of medium sized usually colorful and noisy birds in the crow family Corvidae

Lycopodiopsida is a class of plants often loosely grouped as the fern allies and includes the clubmosses 

Lycopodiopsida traditionally included all the clubmosses including Selaginella and Isoetes But now subdivisions within the Division Lycopodiophyta are made

Clubmosses are thought to be structurally similar to the earliest vascular plants with small scale like leaves homosporous spores borne in sporangia at the bases of the leaves branching stems and generally simple form

A powder known simply as lycopodium consisting of dried spores of the common clubmoss was used in Victorian theater to produce flame effects A blown cloud of spores burned rapidly and brightly but with little heat It was considered safe by the standards of the time

The horsetails are a class in the Pteridophyta They were which one of the most important plant groups in the Palaeozoic era They are seen in the coal measures of the Carboniferous period and some were trees reaching up 30 metres The group is now almost extinct but one genus survives They are vascular plants that reproduce by spores and not by seeds The name horsetail arose because the branched species somewhat resemble a horses tail

Equisetum is the only living genus of horsetails The name Equisetum comes from the Latin The genus includes 15 species One can find horsetails on all continents except from Australasia and Antarctica They are perennial plants either herbaceous they back in winter or they are evergreen They mostly grow 02 15 m tall though E telmateia can exceptionally reach 25 m and the tropical American species E giganteum 5 m and E myriochaetum 8 m

In these plants the leaves are greatly reduced in whorls of small segments fused into nodal sheaths The stems are green and photosynthetic also distinctive in being hollow jointed and ridged usually with 6 40 broken wikt linkridgeridges There may or may not be whorls of branches at the nodes when present these branches are identical to the main stem except smaller

A superficially similar flowering plant unrelated to the genus Equisetum is occasionally misidentified and misnamed as a horsetail

The green algae are the large group of algae from which the higher plants developed They form a group that can included among the Plantae or with the Protista 

The green algae include unicellular and colonial flagellates usually but not always with two flagella per cell as well as various colonial coccoid and filamentous forms In the Charales the closest relatives of higher plants full differentiation of tissues occurs There are about 6000 species of green algae Many species live most of their lives as single cells other species form colonies or long filaments

Brackish water is salt water and fresh water mixed together It is saltier than fresh water but not as salty as seawater It may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water as in estuaries or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers 

Some human activities can produce brackish water mostly certain civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish pools for freshwater prawns 

Technically brackish water contains between 05 and 30 grams of salt per litremore often expressed as 05 to 30 parts per thousand Thus brackish covers a range of salinity regimes and is not considered a precisely defined condition It is characteristic of many brackish surface waters that their salinity can vary considerably over space andor time

The term brackish water comes from the Low German word Brack which is a small lake made when a storm tide breaks a dike and floods land behind the dike

An estuary is a body of water with fresh and salt waterThe most important brackish water habitats are estuaries where a river meets the sea The River Thames flowing through London is one of the most familiar of river estuaries httpwwwthe river thamescoukwildlifehtm

Another important brackish water habitat is the mangrove swamp or mangal 

Some seas and lakes are brackish The Baltic Sea is a brackish sea adjoining the North Sea 

The Caspian Sea is the worlds largest lake and contains brackish water with a salinity about one third that of normal seawater The Caspian is famous for its peculiar animal fauna including one of the few non marine seals and the great sturgeons the source of caviar

Flagellates are cells with one or more whip like organelles called flagella Some cells in animals may be flagellate for instance the spermatozoa of most phyla Higher plants and fungi do not produce flagellate cells but the closely related green algae and chytrids do Many protists take the form of single celled flagellates They are found in most lines of eukaryotes and it is likely that all surviving eukaryotes developed from them

Sustainable energy involves both energy efficiency and renewable energy Both resources help to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions 

Efficient energy use allows energy demand to slow so that rising clean energy supplies can make big cuts in fossil fuel use If energy use grows too fast renewable energy development will chase a receding target Likewise unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed

Any serious vision of a sustainable energy economy thus requires major commitments to both efficiency and renewables

Neoprene is the DuPont Performance Elastomers trade name for a family of synthetic rubbers based on polychloroprene Neoprene was invented by DuPont scientists after Dr Elmer K Bolton of DuPont laboratories

Neoprene was the first mass produced synthetic rubber compound

It is used in a wide variety of environments such as in wetsuits laptop sleeves electrical insulation and car fan belts Its chemical inertness makes it well suited for industrial applications such as gaskets hoses and corrosion resistant coatings It can also be used as a base for adhesives 

Yamaha has begun replacing corks not being used for sealing with neoprene 

Pioneer 11 was the second mission to visit Jupiter and the first mission to visit Saturn The spacecraft was launched on April 6 1973 and flew by Jupiter on December 4 1974 and Saturn on September 1 1979 The probe was last heard from November 1995 when the last communication between Earth and the probe ended

Both Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 had plaques etched in gold The plaques were designed by a team lead by Carl Sagan to communicate with extraterrestrial life should the spacecraft come into contact with it

Medical Tourism is the name given to a new health care industry With Medical Tourism people visit another country to get good healthcare often at very low prices Medical Tourism was established shortly after the year 2000 

Examples of common medical procedures done for medical tourists are surgical procedures like joint replacement heart surgery cosmetic surgery dental treatment addictions rehabilitation

the term medical tourism can also be called medical travel health tourism or global healthcare it was initially developed by travel agencies and the mass media to describe the rapidly growing practice of travelling across international borders to obtain health care It also refers pejoratively to the practice of healthcare providers travelling internationally to deliver healthcare12

Countries that are popular for Medical Tourism are

To get an idea of the potential cost savings from medical tourism in Denver Colorado USA a person without health insurance who needs a hip replacement will pay about US 60000 In comparison in Cuba going through medical tourism firm Choice Medical Services the same procedure costs about US 8000 or about an 80 percent savings

The concept of medical tourism is not a new one The first recorded instance of medical tourism dates back thousands of years to when Greek pilgrims traveled from all over the Mediterranean to the small territory in the Saronic Gulf called Epidauria This territory was the sanctuary of the healing god Asklepios Epidauria became the original travel destination for medical tourism

Spa towns and sanitariums may be considered an early form of medical tourism In eighteenth century England for example medtrotters visited spas because they were places with supposedly health giving mineral waters treating diseases from gout to liver disorders and bronchitis

An aquifer is an underground layer where the material contains water

That can be less solid material like sand gravel clay or silt but it can be rock as well as long as the rock allows water to get in From such layers or groundwater can be usefully extracted using a water well The study of water flow in aquifers and the characterization of aquifers is called hydrogeology

Aquifers can occur at various depths Those closer to the surface are not only more likely to be exploited for water supply and irrigation but are also more likely to be topped up by the local rainfall Many desert areas have limestone hills or mountains within them or close to them which can be exploited as groundwater resources If more water is taken out than get in again one speeks of over exploitation Along the coastlines of certain countries such as Libya and Israel population growth has led to over population which has caused the lowering of water table and the subsequent contamination of the groundwater with saltwater from the sea In these cases the aquifer contains brackish water 

The diagram shows typical flow directions in a cross sectional view of a simple confinedunconfined aquifer system The water table and unsaturated zone are also illustrated

AFI is an acronym that can mean

Voyager 2 is a spacecraft used by NASA to explore Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune It has currently been the only spacecraft to travel to Uranus and Neptune Because of this a majority of pictures we see of these two planets came from this spacecraft It was identical in form to its sister ship Voyager 1 The probe is currently moving away from the solar system and is heading out into deep space

Voyager 2 was launched on August 20 1977

Both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 include the Voyager Golden Record which is a recording of sounds and images of life on earth It was designed by a team headed by Carl Sagan to communicate with extraterrestrial life

World Party Day is celebrated on April 3 as a synchronized global mass celebration of a better world and the creation of desirable reality

The idea of a coordinated synchronized worldwide party appeared as a work of fiction in the book Flight A Quantum Fiction Novel by American writer Vanna Bonta In the ending of the book published in 1995 all people in the world celebrated at the same time

Masses of people grew larger by connecting with groups who shared ideals of peace and goals of using human intelligence and resources toward humanitarian progress A massive worldwide phenomenon now in progress involves millions of individuals organizations and corporations around the world who are realizing a responsibility and ability to contribute positively to the collective future of humanity and Earth

The internet media and communication has accelerated one of the biggest social transformations in human history facilitating the organization of global movements Research has begun documenting the emerging social transformation of people around the world uniting for a positive joyful future for humanity through a common task

Many cities and regions in the United States France England Africa Italy China Korea Vietnam India and Thailand have notable celebrations of World Party Day Radio stations and internet communities spread the event with podcasts of World Party I

Simultaneous celebration of World Party Day occurs in every continent of the world including the Middle East and Africa

The celebration has no religious or political connections The theme of World Party Day celebrations is a universal human right to fun peace and life The only requirement is to celebrate and party from any place whether a formal event or private party large or small or alone

Global podcasts in 2007 featured a variety of music including the African Childrens Choir Hip Hop artists and radio stations reading from the novel Flight 

Events have been organized as dance parties concerts and meditations however the only mandatory observance is a synchronized mass awareness of the human right to enjoy life and displaying hospitality Some public celebrations organize multicultural food and music events

Since 2000 synchronized global events have escalated such as The Quadrille Dance Parade at which in 2007 its 7th year 24000 people danced at once In 2006 23600 danced simultaneously in a total of 36 cities

Petitions circulate to world leaders to officially declare the holiday with the objective of complete world participation every April 3 with everyone in the world having a party in their own way where ever they are

Separation of Powers means that the three branches of government are separated

The three branches are

Separation of Powers helps to make sure people are safe The executive branch carries out the laws but cannot make laws to make themselves powerful Also the judiciary is responsible for making sure that criminals are punished so that members of the government or legislature cannot ignore the law as the judiciary can check on them

Separation of powers is also called a system of checks and balances because the branches can check up on each other and if are gets too strong it will be balanced by the others 

In the United States the three branches of government are completely separate except for the Vice President who is President of the Senate In the United Kingdom the three branches of Government are mixed but the checks and balances are provided by history and convention The Queen is Head of State but is also part of Parliament and is the Fountain of Justice But by convention she does not do anything without the advice of Ministers and never refuses to pass Acts of Parliament The Queen has a lot of power but the power is controlled and balanced by the need to act in certain ways or only use the power at certain times

In some countries the leaders of the executive branch are members of the legislature This system is called responsible government

The Exclusionary rule is a rule in United States constitutional law It says that evidence from people who were forced to talk is not allowed in court Also evidence gotten from an illegal search of property may not be used in court

Chitin is a semitransparent material that is the main component of the exoskeletons of arthropods such as crustaceans and insects of the cell walls of fungi the radula of molluscs and the beaks of cephalopods Chitin has also proven useful for several medical and industrial purposes

The radula is the toothed chitinous ribbon in the mouth of most molluscs It can be compared with the tongue of human beings but unlike our tongue it is used for cutting and chewing food before it enters the esophagus 

The radula is present in all molluscs except bivalves and only in molluscs For example Gastropods use it to graze and scrape diatoms and other microscopic algae off rock surfaces and other substrata Squid use it for cutting up their prey 

An exoskeleton supports and protects an animals body from outside and not like the internal endoskeleton of  for example human beings  from inside 

Many invertebrate animals have exoskeletons in the sense of external hard parts But if one speaks of an exoskeleton one mostly means that of arthropods 

Exoskeletons contain rigid and resistant components that fulfil a set of functional roles including protection excretion sensing support feeding and acting as a barrier against desiccation Exoskeletons first appeared in the fossil record about 550 million years ago and their evolution has been seen as critical as a driving role in the Cambrian explosion of animals that took place subsequent to this time

Adetokunbo Adegboyega Ademola KBE was a Nigerian judge and former Chief Justice of Nigeria Before becoming the Chief Justice he was Chief Justice of the Western Region of Nigeria 

Although Justice Ademola is known for his judicial duties he was an important person in the Nigerian crisis of 1966 Then a counter coup had challenged the unity of Nigeria A few Northern Military officers had successfully executed a coup with a plan to secede from Nigeria But the British High Commission which gets intelligence briefings on Nigeria and Chief Justice Ademola persuaded the Northern leaders not to quit but to take power

Adetokunbo Ademola was born on February 1 1906 to the family of a titled traditional ruler of Abeokuta Oba Ladapo Ademola He later married the daughter of a prominent Lagos lawyer Kofo Moore

He attended St Gregorys Grammar School and Kings College Lagos before proceeding to Selwyn College Cambridge He was then called to the bar in 1934 and started work as a crown counsel In 1939 he was appointed a magistrate before becoming a junior high court judge in 1949 In 1955 he was made the Chief Judge of Western Nigeria and later became the Chief Justice of the country

As the Chief Justice he was instrumental to the establishment of the Nigerian Law School the first located in the country He was also involved in a case Lakanmi vs the Attorney General of Nigeria where he ruled that a Nigerian court could review military decrees

An endoskeleton is a structure that holds an animal from inside 

One can find endoskeletons in three phyla and one subclass of animals in Chordata Echinodermata Porifera and Coleoidea An endoskeleton allows the body to move and gives the body structure and shape 

A true endoskeleton develops from mesodermal tissue Such a skeleton is present in echinoderms and chordates The Coleoidae do not have a true endoskeleton in the evolutionary sense here a mollusc exoskeleton developed into several sorts of internal structure the cuttlebone of cuttlefish being the best known version An important advantage of an endoskeleton over an exoskeleton is that the endoskeleton provides more structural support

In professional wrestling something that is kayfabe is not real something that is acted out and not happening in real life Many things in wrestling are kayfabe that is they appear to be real but are in actuality fake

People who believe that kayfabe acts are real are called marks as opposed to smarts Those who know wrestling is scripted but still enjoy the storylines are known as smart marks or smarks

It is unknown where the term came from it is sometimes believed that the term kayfabe is a modification of the Pig latin word for fake akefay

A zoospore is an asexual spore that uses a flagellum for moving around It is also called a swarm spore These spores are created by some algae and fungi to multiply themselves

There are two types of flagellated zoospores whiplash and tinsel or decorated

Both tinsel and whiplash flagella beat in a sinusoidal wave pattern but when both are present the tinsel will beat in the opposite direction of the whiplash to give 2 axes of control of motility

A zoosporangium is the sexual structure in which the zoospores develop in a plant fungi or protists

A gamete is a specialized sex cell that fuses with another gamete during fertilization in organisms that reproduce sexually Gametes are produced by germ cells

In species which produce two morphologically distinct types of gametes and in which each individual produces only one type a female is any individual which produces the larger type of gametecalled an ovumand a male produces the smaller typecalled a spermatozoon 

The name gamete was introduced by the Austrian biologist Gregor Mendel

Morphology may mean

The word morphology is from the Greek morph form and lgos word study research The concept of morphology was developed by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and independently by the German anatomist and physiologist Karl Friedrich Burdach

Morphology is a branch of bioscience dealing with the study of the form and structure of organisms and their specific structural features

In general use the word morphology refers to the form and structure an organism as a whole which includes all internal and external structures Because the word morph refers to form and is descriptive of structural design traits such as color pattern and size are cosmetic and therefore not morphological because they are descriptive of visual perception and not physical structure While shape is related to morphology in that structures have form shape alone is not morphological without reference to structure because structural design is not dependant upon shape This can be understood by considering an example consisting of two simple toy cars which are comprised of a plastic body two axles and four wheels Though they may be shaped very differently the components have the same function and location within the models There is therefore no morphological difference between them despite a difference in shape In this way morphology is strictly limited to form and structure

In English speaking countries the term molecular morphology has been used for some time for describing the structure of compound molecules such as polymers and RNA The term gross morphology refers to the collective structures or an organism as a whole as a general description of the form and structure of an organism taking into account all of its structures without specifying an individual structure

A taxon or taxonomic unit is a name that means an organism or group of organisms 

One can assign a rank to a taxon and can place at a particular level in a systematic hierarchy depending on their evolutionary relationships

One has to distinct between taxataxonomy and classificationsystematics Taxonomy refers to biological names and the rules of naming Classification refers to rank ordering of taxa according to presumptive evolutionary relationships 

A broad scheme of ranks in hierarchical order

Note Phylum applies formally to any biologial domain but traditionally it was always used of animals whereas Division was traditionally often used of plants fungi etc

A simple phrase to remember the order is Dignified Kings Play Chess On Fine Green Silk

In biological taxonomy a domain is a taxon in the highest rank of organisms higher than a kingdom 

Domain is the most inclusive of these biological groupings The arrangement of taxa reflects the fundamental evolutionary differences in the genomes There are several modern alternative domain classifications of life Among them are

and the most recent 

Keratins are a family of fibrous proteins they are what make up hair in animals as well as horns nails hooves shells beaks and feathers The name comes from Greek word keras meaning horn

Keratins are tough and insoluble They form the hard but non mineral structures in reptiles birds amphibians and mammals A similar biological toughness is found in chitin

Keratins are the main constituent of structures that grow from the skin 

Arthropods such as crustaceans often have parts of their armor or exoskeleton made of keratin sometimes in combination with chitin

Keratins are also found in the gastrointestinal tracts of many animals including roundworms 

Although it is now difficult to be certain the scales claws some protective armour and the beaks of dinosaurs would almost certainly have been composed of a type of keratin 

The silk fibroins produced by insects and spiders are often classified as keratins though it is unclear whether they are phylogenetically related to vertebrate keratins

Silk found in insect pupae and in spider webs and egg casings also has twisted pleated sheets incorporated into fibers wound into larger supermolecular aggregates 

Fibrous proteins also called scleroproteins are long filamentous protein molecules 

Fibrous proteins are only found in animals

Fibrous proteins form rod or wire like shapes and are usually inert structural or storage proteins They are generally water insoluble Fibrous proteins are usually used to construct connective tissues tendons bone matrix and muscle fiber

Examples of fibrous proteins include keratins collagens and elastins

Filament could mean

In physics and electrical engineering

In astronomy

In biology

Other uses

In biology a filament is a long chain of proteins such as those found in hair muscle or in flagella

Raster graphics use pixels to make up a larger image This does not mean the artist has to use pixels  raster programs often have tools like paintbrushes paint buckets and erasers to make a picture Do you think the part thats highlighted is clear enough Panda Bear 2048 5 August 2007

A more ancient form of hanami also exists in Japan which celebrates the plum blossoms instead of cherry blossoms This kind of hanami is popular among older people because they are more calm than the sakura parties which usually involve younger people and can sometimes be very crowded and noisy

The practice of hanami is many centuries old It is said to have started during the Nara Period when the Chinese Tang Dynasty influenced Japan in many ways one of which was the custom of enjoying flowers Though it was ume blossoms that people admired in the beginning by the Heian Period sakura began to attract more attention The sakura were considered sacred by the Japanese and they were so important that they still are a cultural symbol of Japan People believed in gods existence inside the trees and the hanami party was used in the beginning to divine that years harvest and to broken wikt linkannouncementannounce the season of planting rice Those who went to the hanami made offerings at the root of sakura trees and after the ceremony they took part in the offering drinking sake

Emperor Saga of the Heian Period adopted this custom and celebrated parties to view the flowers with sake and feasts under the blossoming branches of sakura trees in the Imperial Court in Kyoto This was said to be the origin of hanami in Japan Poems were written praising the delicate flowers which were seen as a metaphor for life itself beautiful but lasting for a very short time This temporary view of life is very popular in Japanese culture and is usually considered as an admirable form of existence for example in the samurais principle of life ending when its still beautiful and strong instead of slowly getting old and weak The Heian era poets used to write poems about how much easier things would be in Spring without the sakura blossoms because their existence reminded us that life is very short

Hanami was used as a term that meant cherry blossom viewing for the first time in the Heian era novel Tale of Genji From then on in tanka and in haiku poetry flowers meant sakura and the terms hanami and flower party were only used to mean sakura blossom viewing At the beginning the custom was followed only by the Imperial Court but the samurai nobility also began celebrating it during the Azuchi Momoyama Period In those years Toyotomi Hideyoshi gave great hanami parties in Yoshino and Daigo and the festivity became very popular through all the Japanese society Shortly after that farmers began their own custom of climbing nearby mountains in the springtime and having lunch under the blooming cherry trees This practice called then as the spring mountain trip combined itself with that of the nobles to form the urban culture of hanami By the Edo Period all the common people took part in the celebrations in part because Tokugawa Yoshimune planted areas of cherry blossom trees to encourage this Under the sakura trees people had lunch and drank sake in cheerful feasts

The Japanese people continue the tradition of hanami gathering in great numbers wherever the flowering trees are found Thousands of people fill the parks to hold feasts under the flowering trees and sometimes these parties go on until late at night In more than half of Japan the cherry blossoming days come at the same time of the beginning of school and work after vacation and so welcoming parties are often opened with hanami Usually people go to the parks to keep the best places to celebrate hanami with friends family and company broken wikt linkcoworkercoworkers many hours or even days before In cities like Tokyo its also common to have celebrations under the sakura at night Hanami at night is called yozakura In many places such as Ueno Park temporary paper lanterns are hung to have yozakura

The blossom forecast is broken wikt linkannouncementannounced each year by the Japan Meteorological Agency and is watched with attention by those who plan to celebrate hanami because the blossoms last for very little time usually no more than two weeks The first cherry blossoms happen in the subtropical southern islands of Okinawa while on the northern island of Hokkaido they bloom much later In most large cities like Tokyo Kyoto and Osaka the cherry blossom season normally takes place around the end of March and the beginning of April The television and newspapers closely follow this cherry blossom front as it slowly moves from South to North

The hanami celebrations usually involve eating and drinking and playing and listening music Some special dishes are prepared and eaten at the occasion like dango and bento and its common for sake to be drunk as part of the festivity The proverb dumplings rather than flowers makes fun of people who prefer to eat and drink instead of admiring the blossoms Dead bodies are buried under the cherry trees is a popular saying about hanami after the first line of the 1925 short story Under the Cherry Trees by Motojir Kajii

Recently hanami festivities have also become popular outside of Japan Smaller hanami celebrations in Korea Philippines and China also take place traditionally

In the United States hanami has also become popular In 1912 Japan gave 3000 sakura trees as a gift to the United States to celebrate the nations friendship These trees were planted in Washington DC and another 3800 gifted trees were also taken there in 1956 These sakura trees continue to be a popular tourist attraction and every year the National Cherry Blossom Festival takes place when they bloom in early Spring

In Macon Georgia another cherry blossom festival called the International Cherry Blossom Festival is celebrated every spring Macon is known as the Cherry Blossom Capital of the World because 300000 sakura trees grow there

In Brooklyn New York the Annual Sakura Matsuri Cherry Blossom Festival takes place in May at Brooklyn Botanic Garden This festivity has been celebrated since 1981 and is one of the Gardens most famous attractions Similar celebrations are also done in Philadelphia and other places through the United States

 Originally a landmark literally meant an important or particular geographic point used by explorers and others to find their way back or through an area

In modern use it includes anything that can be recognized easily such as a monument building or other structure In American English it is the main word used to call places that can be of interest to tourists because they are beautiful or big or they have historical importance Landmarks in the British English are normally used for casual navigation such as giving directions to someone to get somewhere This is done in American English as well

Landmarks also can be of two different categories natural and structures constructed by humans

A list of some important landmark buildings across the world today includes

Man made features 

A neighbourhood or neighborhood is a geographic community in a larger city town or suburb Neighbourhoods are often social communities because the people that live in them commonly talk with each other Researchers have not agreed on an exact definition

According to urban scholar Lewis Mumford Neighbourhoods have always exist where humans live Many of the functions of the city are usually distributed into neighbourhoods Archaeologists have found evidence of neighbourhoods in the ruins of most of the earliest cities around the world Historical documents give information about neighbourhood life in many historical preindustrial or nonwestern cities

Neighbourhoods are usually created by social interaction between people living near each another They are local social groups larger than households that are not under the control of city or state officials In some early urban traditions basic municipal functions such as protection marriages cleaning and repairs are done by neighbourhoods This is shown to have happened in historical Islamic cities

Most ancient and historical cities also had administrative districts These were used by the government for taxation and social control Administrative districts are usually larger than neighbourhoods They often cover areas that are larger than just one neighbourhood Sometimes administrative districts are just one neighbourhood This leads to a lot of control of social life by officials For example in the Tang period Chinese capital city Changan neighbourhoods were districts There were state officials who controlled life and activity at the neighbourhood level

Neighbourhoods in very old cities often grouped certain people together Ethnic neighbourhoods were important in many old cities They are still common in cities today Economic specialists including craft makers merchants and others could be grouped together in neighbourhoods There were also neighbourhoods based around certain religions One important part to neighbourhood being different from each other and their people getting along well was how people moved from rural areas to the cities This was always happening in old cities The people moving to the cities often moved in with relatives and people they knew from before moving to the city

In the mainland of the Peoples Republic of China the term is usually used for the urban administrative division These divisions are found below the district level A subdistrict level may exists in some cities They are also called streets The naming may be different from one city to another Neighbourhoods usually have 2000 to 10000 families Within neighbourhoods families are grouped into smaller groups of 100 to 600 families These smaller groups are supervised by a residents committee These groups are often broken down into even smaller groups of fifteen to forty families In most urban areas of China neighbourhood community residential community residential unit residential quarter have the same meaning

Neighbourhood in Turkey is an administrative unit within municipalities It has an official status but no governmental powers Neighbourhoods are administered by the Mukhtar and the Neighbourhood Seniors Council This is a group of 4 people The mukhtar is elected by the people living in the neighbourhood He is an administrator of the district governor Mukhtar also has a seat at the City Assembly This is an organization for the coordination of the public institutions in the city Neighbourhood administrators get a salary from the Central Government They also get money from the fees paid for dealing with certain documents

The term has no official use in the United Kingdom It is often used by local boroughs for sub divisions of their area for the delivery of certain services and functions It is also used as a term to refer to a small area within a town or city The term is commonly used to refer to organisations which deal with such a very local issues such as neighbourhood policing or Neighbourhood watches Government statistics for local areas are often called neighbourhood statistics even though the data is usually broken down into districts and wards

In Canada and the United States neighborhoods often have official or semi official status This is commonly done using neighbourhood associations neighbourhood watches or block watches These may deal with such things as lawn care and fence height They may provide such things as block parties neighbourhood parks and community security In some other places the organisation is the parish A parish may have several neighbourhoods in it depending on the area

A lantern is a device that can be moved from one place to another used to create light and to illuminate open areas Lanterns may be used for giving signals or as general light sources for camping They can have candles inside or use other things as fuel like alcohol or kerosene Lanterns that give dim light are generally used as decoration

Sakura or Cherry Blossom is the Japanese name for decorative cherry trees Prunus serrulata and their blossoms Cherry fruit come from a different species of tree It can also be used as a name

Sakura are object of the Japanese traditional custom of Hanami or Flower viewing

The Maple Leaf flag became Canadas flag on 15 February 1965

Before this Canada used the British Red Ensign with Canadas coat of arms on it Flag experts say that the Red Ensign was defaced by the coat of arms

Flag and heraldry experts also call the design of the flag a Canadian Pale This is because the white stripe in the middle was not the usual narrow stripe but was half the width of the flag This was the first time a design like this was used

OBE can mean

The Goth Theodoric the Great king of the Ostrogoths and regent of the Visigoths was allied by marriage with the Vandals as well as with the Burgundians and the Franks under Clovis I

The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle is an order of chivalry associated with Scotland While its original date of foundation is unknown James VII created the modern Order in 1687 The Order is the Sovereign and sixteen Knights and Ladies as well as certain extra knights The Sovereign decides who is to be a member He or she is not advised by the Government as occurs with most other Orders The sixteen members are required to be Scottish born but the extra knights and ladies are not

The Orders main emblems are the thistle the national flower of Scotland and Saint Andrew holding a saltire The motto is Nemo me impune lacessit the same motto also appears on the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom for use in Scotland and on some pound coins St Andrew is also the patron saint of the Order

Most British orders of chivalry cover all of the United Kingdom but the three most most senior ones each cover only one constituent country The Order of the Thistle which covers to Scotland is the second most senior in precedence Its equivalent in England The Most Noble Order of the Garter is the oldest order of chivalry in the United Kingdom dating to the middle fourteenth century In 1783 an Irish order The Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick was founded but since the independence of the Republic of Ireland the Order has fallen dormant The last new knight was created in 1927 and the last surviving Knight of St Patrick died in 1974 

The original date of the Orders foundation is not known One story says that Achaius King of Scots was fighting King Aethelstan of East Anglia and he saw cross of St Andrew in the sky After he won the battle Achaius established the Order of the Thistle Even though Achaius and Aethelstan never fought this story of the foundation is given in the Royal Warrant reviving the Order in 1687 Another story says that the Order was instituted or re instituted by Robert I at the Battle of Bannockburn

King James II and VII issued letters patent reviving and restoring the Order of the Thistle to its full glory lustre and magnificency in 1687 Only 12 knights were allowed and he appointed eight before the King was deposed in 1688 His successors the William and Mary did not make any more appointments to the Order In 1703 however Anne once again revived the Order of the Thistle

The Kings of Scotlandlater the Kings of Great Britain and of the United Kingdomhave served as Sovereigns of the Order

When James VII revived the Order the statutes said that the Order would continue the ancient number of Knights which was described in the preceding warrant as the Sovereign and twelve Knights Brethren in allusion to the Blessed Saviour and his Twelve Apostles

In 1827 George IV increased the Order to sixteen members Women were excluded from the Order George VI created his wife Elizabeth Bowes Lyon a Lady of the Thistle in 1937 and in 1987 Elizabeth II allowed the regular admission of women to both the Order of the Thistle and the Order of the Garter

From time to time individuals joined the Order by special permission These members are known as Extra Knights and do not count towards the sixteen member limit Members of the British Royal Family are normally admitted by special permission the first was Prince Albert King Olav V of Norway was the first foreigner to be admitted to the Order was also admitted by special permission in 1962

The Sovereign has historically had the power to choose Knights of the Order From the eighteenth century onwards the Sovereign made his or her choices upon the advice of the Government George VI felt that the Orders of the Garter and the Thistle had been used only for political patronage rather than to reward actual merit Therefore in 1946 with the agreement of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition both Orders returned to the personal gift of the Sovereign

Knights and Ladies of the Thistle may also be admitted to the Order of the Garter 

Knights and Ladies of the Thistle may also have their knighthoods taken away But this has happened only once to John Erskine 6th Earl of Mar who was deprived of both the knighthood and the earldom after taking part in the Jacobite rising of 1715

The Order has five officers 

For the Orders great occasions such as its annual service each June or July as well for coronations the Knights and Ladies wear an elaborate costume

Aside from these special occasions however much simpler badges are used whenever a member of the Order attends an event at which decorations are worn

When James VII revived the Order in 1687 he wanted the Abbey Church at the Palace of Holyroodhouse to be the Chapel for the Order of the Thistle perhaps copying the idea from the Order of the Garter 

James VII was deposed by 1688 and the Order did not have a Chapel until 1911 when one was added onto St Giles High Kirk in Edinburgh Each year the Sovereign stays at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in June or July during the visit a service for the Order is held Any new Knights or Ladies are installed at annual services 

Each member of the Order including the Sovereign is allotted a seat in the Chapel Their coat of arms is above their seat

There is one vacancy

The nasal septum separates the left and right airways in the nose and divides the two nostrils 

The fleshy external end of the nasal septum is sometimes also called columella

The nasal septum is composed of three structures

The nasal septum can depart from the centreline of the nose this condition is known as a deviated septum Trauma excessive nose picking and cocaine usage can cause septum perforations or holes developing in the septum

An operation to the nasal septum is known as a septoplasty

A nostril is one of the two channels of the nose from the point where they broken wikt linkbifurcatebifurcate to the external opening 

In birds and mammals they contain branched bones or cartilages called turbinates whose function is to warm air on inhalation and remove moisture on exhalation Fish do not breathe through their noses but they do have two small holes used for smelling which may be called nostrils

In humans the nasal cycle means that during the course of a day the nostrils will switch over approximately every four hours or so meaning that only one nostril is used at any one time

The ethmoid bone is a bone in the skull that separates the nasal cavity from the brain As such it is located at the roof of the nose between the two orbits The cubical bone is lightweight due to a spongy construction 

The ethmoid bone consists of four parts

Blows to the head can shear off the olfactory nerves that pass though the ethmoid bone and cause anosmia an irreversible loss of the sense of smell and a great reduction in the sense of taste This not only deprives life of some of its pleasures but can also be dangerous as when a person fails to smell smoke gas or spoiled food

The Bundesverdienstkreuz is officially called the Verdienstorden der Bundesrepublik Deutschland It is Germanys only general decoration This Federal Order of Merit was created on 7 September 1951 Between 3000 and 5200 awards are given every year in all classes

Arturo Toscanini was an Italian conductor Most musicians think he was the greatest conductor of his time His fame was legendary he was probably the first conductor to become a world superstar He had an incredibly good memory and could remember every single note of the large number of works he conducted He had a photographic memory so that he could remember what the pages looked like Sometimes he found little mistakes in the scores which no one else had ever noticed He had a very keen sense of hearing and knew exactly what each instrument was doing He also had a fiery temperament and there are films of him shouting angrily at his orchestra in rehearsals In the early days of gramophone recordings he made some of the first recordings of famous orchestral works

Toscanini was born in Parma in Italy He won a scholarship to the local music conservatory where he learned to play the cello He joined the orchestra of an opera company and he toured South America with them in 1886 While performing Verdis opera Aida in Rio de Janeiro the audience did not like the conductor and they booed him so that he had to leave the stage No one knew what to do at first but then they persuaded Toscanini who was only 19 years old to put down his cello and conduct the orchestra He did this brilliantly from memory and that night he became famous

When he got back to Italy Toscanini returned to his chair in the cello section and took part as cellist in the first performance of Verdis Otello Verdi was there and was very impressed when Toscanini asked him about a mistake he noticed in the score 

Soon the young musicians reputation as a brilliant conductor of opera grew He conducted the first performances of Puccinis La Bohme and Leoncavallos Pagliacci In 1896 he conducted his first symphonic concert in Turin By 1898 he was conductor at La Scala Milan and he stayed there until 1908 but returned during the 1920s He took the Scala Orchestra to the United States on a concert tour in 1920 21 it was during that tour that Toscanini made his first recordings

Toscanini started conducting outside Europe at the Metropolitan Opera in New York as well as the New York Philharmonic Orchestra He toured Europe with the New York Philharmonic in 1930 and always had great success Toscanini was the first non German conductor to conduct at Bayreuth In the 1930s he conducted at the Salzburg Festival and the first concert in 1936 of the newly formed Palestine Symphony Orchestra in Tel Aviv and later performed with them in Jerusalem Haifa Cairo and Alexandria 

At first Toscanini agreed with Fascism but later when the dictator Mussolini came to power he became against it He refused to perform an opera at La Scala and was beaten up so he left Italy and went to the United States

There was no orchestra for him in the USA so they made a new orchestra for him to conduct This was the NBC Symphony Orchestra created for him in 1937 He conducted the first broadcast concert on December 25 1937 in NBC Studio 8 H in New York Citys Rockefeller Center

Toscanini was often criticized for not performing much American music and contemporary music However in 1938 he conducted the world premieres of two orchestral works by Samuel Barber Adagio for Strings and Essay for OrchestraEssay for Orchestra In 1945 he led the orchestra in Carnegie Hall recording sessions of American music including An American in Paris by George Gershwin He also conducted broadcast performances of Coplands El Salon Mexico and Gershwins Rhapsody in Blue with soloists Earl Wild and Benny Goodman and Concerto in F with pianist Oscar Levant as well as music by other American composers including two marches of John Philip Sousa

In 1940 Toscanini had a disagreement with the NBC and he threatened to move to CBS Although they agreed in the end it was this time that Leopold Stokowski began conducting some of the concerts and continued to appear sometimes as a guest conductor of the orchestra

In July 1942 Toscanini conducted the American premiere of Dmitri Shostakovichs Symphony no 7 Due to World War II the score was microfilmed in the Soviet Union and brought by courier to the United States At first Stokowski wanted to conduct it but then he agreed that Toscanini would Unfortunately for New York listeners a big thunderstorm made it difficult to hear the music on the radio Later the performance was reissued

The orchestra went all over the world with Toscanini In 1950 the NBC concerts moved to Carnegie Hall In a programme of music by Richard Wagner in 1954 Toscanini was not well and forgot how the music went He never conducted in public again after that

Toscanini married Carla De Martini on June 21 1897 when she was not yet 20 years old  They had four children although one died He worked with many great singers and musicians including the pianist Vladimir Horowitz who was a great friend Horowitz married one of Toscaninis daughters

When he died of a stroke in New York at the age of 89 his body was returned to Italy and was interred in the Cimitero Monumentale in Milan

Many years after his death in 1987 Toscanini was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award

He was awarded the Hugo Award for his novel The Man in the High Castle in 1963 I want to write about people I love and put them into a fictional world spun out of my own mind not the world we actually have because the world we actually have does not meet my standards Dick wrote of these stories In my writing I even question the universe I wonder out loud if it is real and I wonder out loud if all of us are real Dick spent most of his career as a writer He did not have much money 

In 2007 Dick became the first science fiction writer to be included in The Library of America series

The Man in the High Castle takes place in an different universe There the United States is ruled by the Axis powers who have won the Second World War Many people consider it to be one of the important novels about a different view on history It is the only Dick novel to win a Hugo Award Philipkdickfanscom recommends this novel along with Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and Ubik as an introductory novel to readers new to the writing of Philip K Dick

The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch uses many concepts from science fiction It has several layers of reality and unreality It is also one of Dicks first works to explore religious themes

The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch takes place in the twenty first century Under the supervision of the United Nations authority mankind has colonized the solar systems every habitable planet and moon Life is physically daunting and psychologically monotonous for most colonists so the UN must draft people to go to the colonies Most entertain themselves using Perky Pat dolls and accessories manufactured by Earth based PP Layouts The company also secretly creates Can D an illegal but widely available hallucinogenic drug allowing the user to translate into Perky Pat or Pats boyfriend Walt This recreational use of Can D allows colonists to experience a few minutes of an idealized life on Earth by participating in a collective hallucination

Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is the story of a bounty hunter policing the local android population It occurs on a dying poisoned Earth All successful humans have left the only remaining inhabitants of the planet are people with no prospects off world Androids also known as andys all have a preset death date However a few andys seek to escape this fate and supplant the humans on Earth

Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is well known as the literary source of the influential 1982 film Blade Runner It is about the question What is real what is fake Are the human looking and human acting androids fake or real humans Should we treat them as machines or as people What important factor defines humanity as distinctly alive versus those merely alive only in their outward appearance

Ubik uses big networks of psychics and a suspended state after death in creating a state of eroding reality In 2005 Time Magazine listed it among the All TIME 100 Greatest Novels

Flow My Tears The Policeman Said is about Jason Taverner a television star living in a dystopic near future police state After being attacked by an angry ex girlfriend Taverner awakens in a dingy hotel room He still has his money in his wallet but his identification cards are missing This is no minor inconvenience as security checkpoints are set up throughout the city to stop and arrest anyone without valid ID

Jason at first thinks that he was robbed but soon discovers that his entire identity has been erased There is no record of him in any official database and even his closest associates do not recognize or remember him For the first time in many years Jason has no fame or reputation to rely on He has only his charisma to help him when he tries to find out what happened to his past and avoid the attention of the pols

Flow My Tears The Policeman Said was Dicks first published novel after years of silence In these years his critical reputation had grown and this novel was awarded the John W Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel It is the only Philip K Dick novel nominated both for a Hugo and for a Nebula Award 

In an essay written two years before dying Dick described how he learned from his Episcopalian priest that an important scene in the novel was very similar to a scene in the Book of Acts Richard Linklater talks about this novel in his film Waking Life which begins with a scene reminiscent of another Dick novel Time out of Joint

A Scanner Darkly is a bleak mixture of science fiction and police procedural novels In its story an undercover narcotics police detective begins to lose touch with reality This is because he becomes a victim of the drug he should have fought against This drug is called SubstanceD It permanently changes the mind of the people who take it SubstanceD is instantly addictive It starts with a pleasant euphoria This feeling is quickly replaced with increasing confusion hallucinations and eventually total psychosis It was adapted to film by Richard Linklater

VALIS is perhaps Dicks most postmodern and autobiographical novel It looks at his own unexplained experiences Some people also see it as his most academic work It was made into an opera by Tod Machover VALIS was voted Philip K Dicks best novel at the website philipkdickfanscom

Renewable energy commercialization involves many different technologies including solar photovoltaics solar thermal power plants solar heating and cooling systems wind power hydroelectricity geothermal power biomass and ocean energy systems Each is at a different stage of development yet the market is growing for many renewables 

Wind power is growing at the rate of 30 annually with a worldwide installed capacity of 158 gigawatts in 2009 and is widely used in Europe Asia and the United States At the end of 2009 cumulative global photovoltaic installations surpassed 21 GW and PV power stations are popular in Germany and Spain Solar thermal power stations operate in the USA and Spain and the largest of these is the 354 megawatt SEGS power plant in the Mojave Desert The worlds largest geothermal power installation is The Geysers in California with a rated capacity of 750 MW Brazil has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world involving production of ethanol fuel from sugar cane and ethanol now provides 18 of the countrys automotive fuel Ethanol fuel is also widely available in the USA

While many renewable energy projects are large scale renewable technologies are also suited to rural and remote areas where energy is often crucial in human development Globally an estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems Micro hydro systems configured into village scale or county scale mini grids serve many areas More than 30 million rural households get lighting and cooking from biogas made in household scale digesters Biomass cookstoves are used by 160 million households 

Climate change concerns coupled with high oil prices peak oil and increasing government support are driving increasing renewable energy legislation incentives and commercialization New government spending regulation and policies helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better than many other sectors

Something that has impurity is not pure For example water that is clean would be called pure water Water that is dirty would be called impure water

Impurities may be harmful For example an engine works bad when its fuel is not pure

Impure materials are useful sometimes Alloys are metals with impurities Solar cells are made of silicon crystals but a very small amount of impurity is needed in them to work

The Queens Hall was a concert hall in Central London England It opened in 1893 It is best known for being where the Promenade Concerts were started by Robert Newman in 1895

The Queens Hall was built because London needed a new concert hall in the centre of the town It stood in Langham Place just next to where BBC Broadcasting House stands today The Queens Hall had seating for up to 3000 people The arena had removeable seating The polished floor could be used for dancing The acoustics of the hall were excellent There was also a smaller hall The Queens Small Hall which seated 500 people This was used for chamber music In later years it was used as a recording studio The architect who designed the hall was Thomas Edward Knightley

The first time The Queens Hall was used was on 25 November 1993 when Newman gave a childrens party in the afternoon In the evening about 2000 ladies and gentlemen came to a concert given by the Band of the Coldstream Guards which included vocal music piano and organ solos At 1100pm the seats in the arena were removed and the dancing began The official opening of the hall took place on 2 December On 10 August 1895 the first Promenade concert was given with Henry Wood conducting

On January 14 1896 the first public movie show was given at the Queens Hall to members and wives of the Royal Photographic Society

The seats were uncomfortable because there was not enough leg room so in 1913 and 1919 some changes were made after which the hall could seat 2400 people 

From 1930 to 1941 the BBC Symphony Orchestra regularly gave broadcast concerts in the hall Arturo Toscanini who guest conducted the orchestra during the 1930s made some famous recordings in the Queens Hall in the late 1930s

On 10 May 1941 the Royal Choral Society gave a concert in the Queens Hall with the London Symphony Orchestra They performed Elgars oratorio Dream of Gerontius under the conductor Sir Malcolm Sargent It was the last concert ever given there because later that night the hall was completely destroyed by bombs 

After the destruction of Queens Hall the BBC Symphony Orchestra moved its broadcast concerts and recording sessions to Bedford School Among the great recordings made at the school was Sir Adrian Boults recording of Elgars second symphony The Proms continued in the Royal Albert Hall They also took place in Bristol and Bedford but after the war they settled in the Royal Albert Hall where they continue today

Darius the Great was the son of Hystaspes and Shah of Iran from 522 BC to 485 BC After Darius became Shah of Iran he divided the Persian Empire into twenty provinces and appointed a governor for each province He introduced golden coins and developed commerce within the empire and trade without Darius allowed Jews to rebuild the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem He also built many temples in Egypt The largest building that was built by Darius is the new capital of Persepolis near Pasargadae Darius died in Persepolis His tomb was cut into a rock face near Persepolis After his death Xerxes became the Shah of Iran

Pasargadae was a city in ancient Persia and is today a historical site in FarsIran Pasargadae was the first capital of the Persian Empire The building of the capital city by Cyrus the Great begun in 546 BCE but was left unfinished for Cyrus died in 530 BCE Pasargade remained the Persian capital unti Darius I built the Persepolis The tomb of Cyrus the Great is in this city

The American Staffordshire terrier is a breed of dog It was first bred in British colonies of North America in around 1835 Its early ancestors are the bull and the terrier and used to be called the Blue Paul terrier In the 1930s dogbreeders bred it with the Pitbull terrier and its name was changed to the American Staffordshire Terrier in 1972

 Iran Persepolis was an ancient capital of the second Iranian dynasty the Achaemenid Empire Ancient Persians called it Parsa meaning the city of Persians Persepolisis the Greek translation of the name In modern Iran the city is known as Takht e Jamshid The largest building in Persepolis in the Apadana Hall with 72 columns The Tachara palace built by Darius I is also an important building The Hadish palace in Persepolis was started by Xerxes and finished by his son Artaxerxes

Xerxes the Great was a Shah of Iran of Achaemenid dynasty Xerxes was son of Darius I and Atossa the daughter of Cyrus the Great After Darius died Xerxes became the Shah of Iran At the Battle of Thermopylae Xerxes defeated Greek warriors After winning at Thermopylae Xerxes then took control of Athens with his army Finally Greek warriors won the Battle of Salamis against Xerxes in 480 BC

The movie 300 is based on Xerxes

A shell is a hard outer layer which has evolved in a very wide variety of different animals including molluscs sea urchins crustaceans turtles and tortoises armadillos etc 

Seashells are perhaps the most familiar and most common shells both in the wild and for sale as decorative objects They are usually composed of calcium carbonate in the form of calcite or aragonite This can have different forms one is nacre or mother of pearl Other kinds of animal shells are made from chitin bone and cartilage or silica

Shells of many types were popular as human decorations either used whole or cut into pieces One used them for all kinds of pendants beads buttons brooches rings and hair combs

Small pieces of colored shell and iridescent shell have been used to create mosaics and inlays which have been used to decorate larger items such as boxes and furniture Large numbers of whole seashells arranged to form patterns have been used to decorate man made grottos

Several kinds of sea animals have exoskeletons which one can find after their death in beach drift Often beachcombers pick them But usually only those of molluscs are known as seashells

The majority of shell forming molluscs belong to two classes Gastropoda and Bivalvia

Sea turtles are turtles found in all the worlds oceans except the Arctic Ocean and some species travel between oceans 

There are seven types of sea turtles Kemps Ridley Flatback Green Olive Ridley Loggerhead Hawksbill and the leatherback All but the leatherback are in the family Chelonioidea The leatherback belongs to the family Dermochelyidae and is its only member The leatherback sea turtle is the largest measuring six or seven feet in length at maturity and three to five feet in width weighing up to 1300 pounds Most other species are smaller being two to four feet in length and proportionally less wide The Flatback turtle is found solely on the northern coast of Australia

A rudder is used to steer ships boats submarines aircraft hovercraft or other conveniences that move through air or water 

Oars mounted on the side of ships for steering are documented from the 3rd millennium BCE in Persia and Ancient Egypt in artwork wooden models and even parts of actual boats of that times An early example of an oar mounted on the stern is found in the Egyptian tomb of Menna Stern mounted oars were also quite common in Roman river navigation as proved from reliefs more than a millennium later

One of the worlds oldest known image of a stern mounted rudder can be seen on a 2 ft long tomb pottery model of a Chinese junk that dates from the 1st century CE during the Han Dynasty 

The Exploration of Neptune started on August 25 1989 when Voyager 2 became the first and so far only spacecraft to visit the planet Like the other gas giants Neptune has no solid land on its surface so landing on Neptune would be impossible Currently NASA is thinking to send another spacecraft known as the Neptune Orbiter to study more about Neptune the spacecraft is planned to be probably launched on 2035

In Voyager 2s last visit with a planet before leaving the solar system Voyager 2 came only 3000 miles above Neptunes north pole the closest approach it made to any planet after it left Earth Voyager 2 studied Neptunes atmosphere its rings its magnetosphere and its moons Several discoveries were made including the discovery of the Great Dark Spot and Tritons geysers

Voyager 2 found that Neptunes atmosphere was very active even though it gets only 3 of the sunlight Jupiter receives Voyager 2 discovered an anticyclone called the Great Dark Spot similar to Jupiters Great Red Spot However pictures taken by the Hubble Space Telescope showed that the Great Dark Spot had disappeared Also seen in Neptunes atmosphere at that time was an almond shaped spot called D2 and a bright quickly moving cloud high above the cloud decks named Scooter

Voyager 2 also found four rings and found proof for ring arcs or incomplete rings around Neptune Neptunes magnetosphere was also studied by Voyager 2 The planetary radio astronomy instrument found that Neptunes day is sixteen hours seven minutes Voyager 2 also discovered auroras like on Earth but much more complicated

Voyager 2 discovered six moons orbiting Neptune but only three were photographed in detail Proteus Nereid and Triton Proteus turned out to be an ellipsoid as large as an ellipsoid could become without turning into a sphere Proteus is very dark in color Nereid although discovered in 1949 is still not well known even after Voyager 2 passed by Triton was flown by at about 25000 miles away and became the last object Voyager 2 would ever explore Triton was shown to have extraordinary active geysers and polar caps A very thin atmosphere was found as well as thin clouds

A Neptune Orbiter is being considered to study Neptune in more detail release atmospheric probes and possibly release a Triton Lander On the NASA website it lists the earliest possible launch date as 2030 This mission is still a proposal and budget cuts may eliminate it

Kinder Scout is a plateau about 600 metres above sea level It is in Derbyshire roughly between the villages of Hayfield in the west Edale to the southeast and the town of Glossop to the northwest

The gritstone rock under the plateau is covered by a thick layer of peat cut by a dense network of streams which flow off it One of the main streams is the Kinder River which drops steeply off the Western edge at Kinder Downfall Plants on the plateau are mainly heather with some mosses and bilberry although the surrounding slopes have seen encroachment of bracken The highest point is Kinder Low at convert633mabbron

It can be approached from the southeast up a steep track called Jacobs Ladder It is crossed by the 268 mile Pennine Way long distance footpath which starts in nearby Edale Several sections of the path have been surfaced with large stone slabs in this area to try to minimise environmental damage to the fragile moorland ecosystem by the large number of hikers it attracts all year round

In the 1930s Kinder Scout was the scene of the first mass trespasses by ramblers protesting at the lack of public access to the open moorland in many parts of northern England which were then kept for grouse shooting by the estates of a number of stately homes Public rights of way were established later and the 2000 Countryside and Rights of Way Act set a new legal framework in which the bulk of Kinder Scout is now Access Land where the public has a right to roam freely

The stern is the rear part of a ship or boat 

The stern area has always been the place near the steering apparatus and by extension became the domain of the ships captain and other officers In particular the stern was the location of the officers quarters and during the age of sail became the most opulent part of the ship with rows of windows galleries walkways and fine decorations That meant that this part was rather vulnerable and the goal of much maneuvering in battle was to achieve the stern rake in which a ship would pour its entire broadside into the stern

Other features of the stern included lanterns and the ensign

4 Vesta is the second most massive asteroid in the solar system with an average diameter of about 530 km and an estimated mass 9 the mass of the entire asteroid belt Its size and unusually bright surface makes Vesta the brightest asteroid and the only one ever visible to the naked eye from Earth Vestas astronomical symbol is 

Vesta was discovered by the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers on March 29 1807 He allowed the prominent mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss to name the asteroid after the Roman virgin goddess of home and hearth Vesta

After the discovery of Vesta in 1807 no asteroids were discovered for the next 38 years During this time the four known asteroids were counted among the planets and each had its own planetary symbol Vesta was normally represented by a stylized hearth Other symbols are and All are simplifications of the original 

Vesta is the second most massive body in the asteroid belt Vesta does have a different interior compared to its surface It is in the Inner Main Belt at a distance of about 250 AU It is similar to 2 Pallas in volume but somewhat more massive

Vestas shape is close to the shape of a sphere by its own gravity but the large concavity and lump at the pole did not fit the criteria from being considered a planet under the IAU In any case this resolution was rejected by the IAU membership and Vesta will continue to be called an asteroid However it is possible that Vesta may be listed as a dwarf planet in the future if it is convincingly determined that its shape is from hydrostatic equilibrium

Its rotation is actually fast for an asteroid and prograde with the north pole pointing in the direction of right ascension 20 h 32 min declination 48 with an uncertainty of about 10 This gives an axial tilt of 29

Temperatures on the surface have been thought to be between about 20C with the Sun overhead dropping to about 190C at the winter pole Typical day time and night time temperatures are 60C and 130C respectively This estimate is for May 6 1996 very close to perihelion while details vary somewhat with the seasons

For Vesta there is a large collection of possible samples available to scientists in the form of over 200 HED meteorites giving insight into Vestas geologic history and structure

Vesta is thought to consist of a metallic iron nickel core above with a rocky olivine mantle and a surface crust From the first appearance of Ca Al rich inclusions a likely timeline is as follows

Vesta is the only known intact asteroid that has been resurfaced in this procedure However the presence of iron meteorites and achondritic meteorite classes without identified parent bodies indicates that there once were other differentiated planetesimals with igneous histories which have since been broken by impacts

Some Vestian surface features have been resolved using the Hubble Space Telescope and ground based telescopes eg the Keck Telescope

The most notable surface feature is a very large crater that is 460 km in diameter centered near the south pole Its width is about 80 of the entire diameter of Vesta The floor of this crater is about 13 km below and its rim rises 4 12 km above the surrounding area with total surface relief of about 25 km A central peak rises 18 km above the crater floor It is thought that the impact responsible blew up about 1 of the entire volume of Vesta and it is likely that a group of smaller asteroids known as the Vesta family are the remains of this collision If this is the case then the fact that 10 km fragments of the Vesta family have survived bombardment until the present indicates that the crater is only about 1 billion years old or younger It would also be the original site of origin of the HED meteorites In fact all the known V type asteroids taken together account for only about 6 of the ejected volume with the rest presumably either in small fragments ejected by approaching the 31 Kirkwood gap or perturbed away by radiation pressure Spectroscopic analyses of the Hubble images have shown that this crater has penetrated deep through several distinct layers of the crust and possibly into the mantle which is indicated by spectral signatures of olivine Interestingly Vesta was not disrupted nor resurfaced by an impact of this magnitude

Several other large craters about 150 km wide and 7 km deep are also present A dark feature about 200 km across has been named Olbers in honour of Vestas discoverer but it does not appear in elevation maps as a fresh crater would and its nature is presently unknown perhaps an old basaltic surface It serves as a reference point with the 0 longitude prime meridian defined to pass through its center

The eastern and western hemispheres show markedly different terrains From preliminary spectral analyses of the Hubble Space Telescope images the eastern hemisphere appears to be have a highly reflective heavily cratered highland terrain with old dusty rocks and craters probing into deeper plutonic layers of the crust On the other hand large regions of the western hemisphere are taken up by dark geologic units thought to be surface basalts

Various small solar system objects are believed to be fragments of Vesta caused by collisions The Vestoid asteroids and HED meteorites are examples The V type asteroid 1929 Kollaa has been determined to have a composition akin to cumulate eucrite meteorites indicating its origin deep within Vestas crust

Because a number of meteorites are believed to be Vestian fragments Vesta is currently one of only five identified Solar system bodies for which we have physical samples the others being Mars the Moon comet Wild 2 and Earth itself

The first space mission to Vesta will be NASAs Dawn probe which will orbit the asteroid for nine months in 2010 2011 The mission launched on September 27 2007 and will arrive at Vesta in the fall of 2010 Dawn will then proceed to its other target Ceres and will probably continue to explore the asteroid belt on an extended mission using remaining fuel The spacecraft is the first able to enter and leave orbit around more than one body thanks to its weight efficient ion driven engines

Dawn citing budget pressures and technical issues but scientists appealed and won an additional 100 million to continue the program Total mission costs will now be about 450 million

Its size and unusually bright surface make Vesta the brightest asteroid and it is occasionally visible to the naked eye from dark skies Recently in May and June 2007 Vesta reached a peak magnitude of 54 the brightest since 1989

At that time opposition and perihelion were only a few weeks apart It was visible in the constellations Ophiuchus and Scorpius

Less favourable oppositions during late autumn in the Northern Hemisphere still have Vesta at a magnitude of around 70 Even when in conjunction with the Sun Vesta will have a magnitude around 85 thus from a pollution free sky it can be observed with binoculars even at elongations much smaller than near opposition

Cereal is usually refers to a type of grass that is grown to be eaten

It is a common breakfast meal The kind of cereal eaten for breakfast is called breakfast cereal There is a large variety of cereals Some types of breakfast cereal include Cheerios Cocoa Puffs and other various brands Most breakfast cereals are targeted to be sold to kids but there are many for adults as well Some adult cereals are for diets or other health benefits

The word cereal comes from Ceres the name of the Roman goddess of harvest and agriculture Grains are called corn in the United Kingdom and Ireland but in the United States Canada Australia and New Zealand corn means maize

In the 19th century Americans ate meat a lot for breakfast and usually did not eat grains and fiber But after that the people who were interested in eating more healthy foods began a push for healthy breakfasts

This brought up the creation of Granula The name Granula comes from granulates formed of grain In 1863 this became the first breakfast cereal and included heavy nuggets made from bran the outer husk of a grain that is taken out when making flour The cereal had to be soaked overnight before being eaten Simply pouring milk over it was not enough to make it eatable

The cereals eaten today grew out of a health campaign that began in the 1860s Thin baked dough served to patients in hospitals inspired two men CW Post and W K Kellogg These two men started their own companies named them after themselves

In a species that reproduces sexually sexual attraction is an attraction to other members of the same species for sexual or erotic activity In many species does not always mean a sexual act indeed some sexual behavior among primates is mostly a social activity

Certain things of what is sexually attractive to humans may change from different cultures or regions The sexual attraction of one person to another depends on both people 

Much of human sexual attractiveness comes from physical aspect This involves the impact ones appearance has on the senses especially in the beginning of a relationship

Cheerios is a popular brand of cereal It is manufactured by General Mills It was founded in 1941 as CheeriOats the first ready to eat oat cereal They are still making cereal and it is produced worldwide

A rehearsal is a practice before a concert or play in a theatre or some other performance The group of broken wikt linkperformerperformers will get together to rehearse They may rehearse together many times before the performance so that they get used to performing with one another

A dress rehearsal is the last rehearsal before the performance It is called a dress rehearsal because in a theatre the actors will be wearing their costumes When an orchestra or other music group have a dress rehearsal this does not mean that they have to dress up It simply means that it is the last rehearsal and it will be in the hall where they are going to perform so that everything is as it will be for the performance

Orchestras often have section rehearsals or sectionals This means that each group of instruments rehearse separately eg the string sectional will be all the string instruments rehearsing together This can be useful because they can concentrate on the bits which are particularly difficult for them the string instruments can talk about the bowing etc

An open rehearsal is a rehearsal that the public can come and watch In opera houses the dress rehearsal is often an open rehearsal The entry may be free or the audience may have to pay but not as much as for a ticket for a performance The audience will have to understand that the performance may be stopped if something goes wrong and needs to be rehearsed Singers will often save their voices by not singing as loudly as they will in the performance

A technical rehearsal in a theatre is a rehearsal for practising things such as lighting and using props

The London Symphony Orchestra is one of the most famous orchestras of the world They are based in Londons Barbican Centre but they often tour to lots of different countries

The LSO started in 1904 Most of the players had been members of Henry Woods Queens Hall orchestra They left that orchestra when Henry Wood made a rule that they were not allowed to send deputies to rehearsals or concerts The LSO was set up as a self governing organization This means that the players themselves organize everything they decide how much they are going to be paid who can be in the orchestra etc

The LSO gave its first concert on 9 June 1904 with Hans Richter conducting He was principal conductor until 1911 when Edward Elgar took over for a year Some of the worlds most famous conductors have conducted the orchestra Since January 2007 Valery Gergiev has been the LSOs Principal Conductor Andr Previn is the Conductor Laureate In 2006 Daniel Harding became the co principal guest conductor together with Michael Tilson Thomas Richard Hickox is the Associate Guest Conductor of the LSO The leader of the orchestra is Gordan Nikolitch

The LSO was the first British orchestra to play overseas when it went to Paris in 1906 The LSO players all came close to death in 1912 because they were due to sail on the RMS Titanic for a concert in New York Fortunately they had to change the booking at the last minute They did tour the USA and Canada that year and were the first British orchestra to do so

In 1966 the London Symphony Chorus was formed to join the LSO for works with choirs

For many years the LSO refused to allow women to become members because they thought the sound would not be so good 

The LSO made their first gramophone recording in 1920 Since then they have made a very large number of recordings

The orchestra was formed in 1932 by Sir Thomas Beecham and played its first concert on October 7 1932 at the Queens Hall London The associate conductor at the time was Malcolm Sargent

At one of the orchestras early concerts in November 1932 the sixteen year old Yehudi Menuhin played a programme of violin concertos including the concerto by Elgar which the composer himself conducted

In the 1930s when Beecham conducted at the Royal Opera House the orchestra played for operas there Beecham made many recordings with the orchestra

In 1939 the orchestras sponsors stopped giving money to the orchestra The orchestra became a self governing body which meant that like the London Symphony Orchestra the players organized the orchestra themselves deciding on their pay their members what music they should play etc

During the Second World War they went round the country playing in places where people would not otherwise hear music Many of the players instruments were destroyed when the Queens Hall was bombed in May 1941 but lots of people gave money for them to buy new instruments

After the war Beecham returned to the LPO for eighteen months but left to start a new orchestra the Royal Philharmonic The orchestra continued to play with several guest conductors until Eduard van Beinum was appointed When he became ill they appointed Sir Adrian Boult who stayed until 1956 although he continued to work with the orchestra and became its President in 1965

Through the late 1950s the orchestra did not have much money and had to stop paying the players regular salaries They only got paid for the work they did In 1958 the LPO appointed William Steinberg as chief conductor He helped the orchestra to become better again

In 1964 the LPO became the resident orchestra for Glyndebourne Festival Opera in the summer They continue to do this today 

In 1967 the LPO appointed Bernard Haitink as its principal conductor He stayed with the orchestra for 12 years and was followed by Sir Georg Solti

Surrealism was an art and cultural movement which began in 1920

The name was invented in 1917 Guillaume Apollinaire wrote the program notes for the ballet Parade which was created for the Ballets Russes of Serge Diaghilev This was a collaborative work by Jean Cocteau Erik Satie Pablo Picasso and Lonide Massine The program notes ran

The movement grew out of Dadaism This was amid the horrors of World War I a protest at the meaningless of civilised life 

At the same time the work of Sigmund Freud began to filter through and affect the literary and art worlds Andr Breton was trained in psychiatry and during the war he worked in a hospital where he used Freuds methods on shell shock patients Not surprisingly Breton influenced many writers and artists after the war

Freuds work placed emphasis on the subconscious mind and its role in steering behaviour and emotion His way of using free association and dream analysis to get a clue to the subconscious was picked up by the surrealists They painted dreamlike fantasies and practised automatic drawing without sight automatism

In 1924 Breton wrote a Surrealist Manifesto which defined surrealism as

Breton discussed his first encounter with the surreal in a description of a hypnagogic state in which a strange phrase inexplicably appeared in his mind There is a man cut in two by the window This phrase illustrates Bretons view of Surrealism as two distant realities brought together to create a new uncanny union

Surrealist works have an element of surprise unexpected items are placed next to each other for no clear reason Many Surrealist artists and writers see their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost The works are an artifact and Andr Breton said that Surrealism was above all a revolutionary movement From the 1920s in Paris it spread around the globe It influenced films such as the Angels Egg and El Topo

Max Ernst Salvador Dali Man Ray Andr Masson Joan Mir and Marcel Duchamps were some of the best known surrealist artists 

Man Ray made the first surrealist film Return to reasonLuis Buuel and Dali made two well known surrealist films Un chien andalou and Lge dOr Jean Cocteau made three films known as the Orphic Trilogy Le Sang dun pote Orphe and Testament of Orpheus which includes a cameo appearance by Pablo Picasso

A relief is a sculptured artwork where the form is modeled out from a flat background

Reliefs are a common type of artwork found throughout the world particularly to decorate monumental buildings such as temples 

The frieze in the classical Corinthian order is often enriched with bas relief Alto relievo may been seen in the pediments of classical temples eg the Parthenon Reliefs can be used for a single scene or ordered into a narrative They can be very detailed to the extent that even tensed musculature itself may be seen

Several types of relief are commonly used and defined although in all cases the images must attach to the background

Famous examples of reliefs include

Haemophilia is a blood condition that means bleeding does not stop The bleeding occurs because the blood does not clot A person with a small cut or internal bleed could bleed to death They do not bleed more than a normal person but they bleed for much longer The word comes from the Greek words haima blood and philia to love

It usually affects males It is passed from mother to child through genes 

There are 3 types of haemophilia

Haemophilia A happens in about 1 in 500010000 male births Haemophilia B happens in about 1 in every 2000034000 male births

This happens because each male needs a X and a Y chromosome but because the Y chromosome is smaller than the X chromosome some genes are missing Most importantly in haemophilia it is the H gene that is missing If gene h is recessive then it would be replaced by the gene H But when gene H is missing from the Y chromosone then gene h the weak one from the X chromosone takes its place and causes haemophilia There is no cure for this disease but there are different treatments available around the world 

A person with haemophilia is called a haemophiliac

Otis R Bowen MD was the governor of the American state of Indiana from 1973 to 1981 He was the first governor of Indiana to serve two consecutive terms He was also the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services on the cabinet of President Ronald Reagan

Bowen was born in a farmhouse in Fulton County Indiana He raised his family practiced medicine and began his political career while living in Bremen Indiana where he still lives today

On Labor Day weekend in September 1973 Governor Bowen declared amnesty for a group of inmates that took hostages and rioted at the Indiana State Prison Although his decision to give blanket amnesty was a controversial one it proved to be the correct decision as all the hostages who were not only guards but also a few select inmates who were otherwise weak and preyed upon were released without harm The guards who were subsequently released after a short meeting took place between the leaders of the riot and Governor Bowen in front of b blockthe inmate negotiation took only a few minutes between the governor and a group of inmates led by one Thomas D Brown serving 10 years for armed robbery and was compelling enough to cause Gov Bowen to declare a successful blanket amnesty

The governors action preceded a domino effect of changes made in all aspects of the Indiana Department of Corrections The changes involved personnel regulations and conditions within areas of the system eg medical food access to media and disciplinary aspects of every day life

Literal translation is the translation of text from one language to another word for word rather than giving the sense of the original For this reason literal translations usually mis translate idioms For example a literal English translation of the German word Kindergarten would be garden of children but in English the expression refers to the school year between pre school and first grade

At its basic level MT performs simple substitution of words in one natural language for words in another

Current machine translation software often allows to adapt the translation to subject or profession to improve output by limiting the allowable substitutions This technique is particularly effective in domains where formal or formulaic language is used It follows then that machine translation of government and legal documents more readily produces usable output than conversation or less standardised text

In the words of the European Association for Machine Translation

Interlinear text is text on several lines where additional lines give explanations of the main text That can be a transliteration or a translation of each word of the main line or a free translation of the entire main text line

Interlinear text is usually used to translate or explain the main text It is used frequently in foreign language learning material and linguistic literature Latin text books and Greek or Hebrew Bibles with interlinears are common examples

Transcription may mean

Transcript could mean

Transcription is the conversion of a text another medium 

That can be the conversion of human speech into written typewritten or printed form But it can also mean the scanning of books and making digital versions A transcriber is a person who performs transcriptions

Transcription as going from sound to script must be distinguished from transliteration which creates a mapping from one script to another that is designed to match the original script as directly as possible 

Standard transcription schemes for linguistic purposes include the International Phonetic Alphabet and its ASCII equivalent SAMPA See also phonetic transcription

In this table IPA is an example of phonetic transcription of the name of the former Russian president known in English as Boris Yeltsin followed by accepted hybrid forms in various languages Note that Boris is a transliteration rather than transcription in strict sense 

The same words are likely to be transcribed differently under different systems For example the Mandarin Chinese name for the capital of the Peoples Republic of China is Beijing in the commonly used contemporary system Hanyu Pinyin and in the historically significant Wade Giles system it is written Pei Ching

Practical transcription can be done into a non alphabetic language too For example in a Hong Kong Newspaper George Bushs name is transliterated into two Chinese characters that sounds like Bou s by using the characters that mean cloth and special Similarly many words from English and other Western European languages are borrowed in Japanese and are transcribed using Katakana one of the Japanese syllabaries

See also transcription of Chinese transcription of Russian transcribing English to Japanese

After transcribing a word from one language to the script of another language

This is especially evident for Greek loan words and proper names Greek words are normally first transcribed to Latin and then loaned into other languages and finally the loan word has developed according to the rules of the goal language For example Aristotle is the currently used English form of the name of the philosopher whose name in Greek is spelled Ao which was transcribed to Latin Aristteles from where it was loaned into other languages and followed their linguistic development

When this process continues over several languages it may fail miserably in conveying the original pronunciation One ancient example is the Sanskrit word dhyna which transcribed into the Chinese word Chan through Buddhist scriptures Chan was transcribed from Japanese to Zen in English dhyna to Zen is quite a change

Another complex problem is the subsequent change in preferred transcription For instance the word describing a philosophy or religion in China was popularized in English as Tao and given the termination ism to produce an English word Taoism That transcription reflects the Wade Giles system More recent Pinyin transliterations produce Dao and Daoism
