The first translations in a Western language were published in 1862 by Marquis dHervey de Saint Denys in his Posies de lpoque des Thang The English speaking world was introduced to Li Bais works by a Herbert Allen Giles publication History of Chinese Literature and through the liberal but poetically influential translations of Japanese versions of his poems made by Ezra Pound

Li Bai is best known for the extravagant imagination and striking Taoist images in his poetryand for his great love for broken wikt linkliquorliquor He spent much of his life travelling People tell the story that he fell from his boat when he tried to embrace the reflection of the moon and therefore drowned in the Yangtze River

One of Li Bais most famous poems is Drinking Alone by Moonlight which is a good example of some of the most famous aspects of his poetry  a very spontaneous poem full of natural images Li Bai actually wrote several poems with the same title Arthur Waleys version of the most famous reads

Li Bai is influential in the West partly due to Ezra Pounds versions of some of his poems in the collection Cathay such as The River Merchants Wife A Letter In the east he influenced poets like Mi Fei in the Song Dynasty

Mahfouz was born in the Gamaliya quarter of Cairo and was named after Professor Naguib Pasha Mahfouz the renowned Coptic physician who delivered him In his childhood Mahfouz read extensively His mother often took him to museums and Egyptian history later became a major theme in many of his books

The Egyptian Revolution of 1919 had a strong effect on Mahfouz although he was at the time only seven years old From the window he often saw English soldiers firing at the demonstrators men and women You could say he later noted that the one thing which most shook the security of my childhood was the 1919 revolution 

Before the Nobel Prize only a few of his novels had appeared in the West Because of his outspoken support for Sadats Camp David peace treaty with Israel his books were banned in many Arab countries until after he won the Nobel prize

Like many Egyptian writers and intellectuals Mahfouz was on a death list by Islamic fundamentalists He defended Salman Rushdie after the Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini condemned him to death but later he criticized Rushdies Satanic Verses as insulting to Islam 

Before his death Mahfouz was the oldest living Nobel Literature laureate and the third oldest of all time only Bertrand Russell and Halldor Laxness were older At the time of his death he was the only Arabic language writer to have won the Nobel Prize for Literature

The Puritans were a significant grouping of English speaking Protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries Puritans felt that the English Reformation had not gone far enough and that the Church of England was tolerant of practices which they associated with the Catholic Church

A Puritan was any person seeking purity through worship and doctrine Piety simplicity of dress and modesty of life were hallmarks Many of their beliefs were similar to those of Calvinists and Scottish Presbyterians They did not have an all embracing theology beyond a devotion to the Bible and moral purity Puritans believed that political leaders are accountable to God to protect and reward virtue and to punish wrongdoers They opposed the supremacy of the monarch in the church and argued that the only head of the Church in heaven or earth is Christ

Personal biblical interpretation is central to Puritan beliefs and is shared with Protestantism in general Puritans sought conformity to the teaching of the Bible with moral purity pursued down to the smallest detail as well as ecclesiastical purity to the highest level They believed that man existed for the glory of God that his first concern in life was to do Gods will and so to receive future happiness

Like some of Reformed churches on the European continent Puritan reforms were typified by a minimum of ritual and decoration and by an emphasis on preaching Puritan ideals were highly influential in New England to where many groups emigrated John Bunyans The Pilgrims progress was an important work Very often hell was the subject of sermons A well known sermon is Sinners in the hands of an angry god by Jonathan Edwards

Steeping may mean

One example is the steeping of corn part of the milling process As described by the US Corn Refiners Association harvested kernels of corn are cleaned and then steeped in water at a temperature of 50 degrees for 30 to 40 hours In the process their moisture content rises from 15 to 45 and their volume more than doubles The gluten bonds in the corn are weakened and starch is released 

The corn is then ground to break free the germ and other components and the water used which has absorbed various nutrients is recycled for use in animal feeds  

Gluten is a composite of the proteins gliadin and glutenin These proteins are found in the endosperms of some grass like grains such as wheat rye and barley Gliadin and glutenin make up about 80 of the protein contained in wheat seed As they are insoluble in water they can be got by washing away the starch in the grain Worldwide gluten is an important source of food protein both in foods prepared directly from grains with gluten in them and as an additive to foods that are low in protein

Some people are very sensitive to glutens in their food When they eat foods which contain gluten these people may experience stomach cramps bloating gas and diarrhoea This sensitivity is called coeliac disease

The octal numeral system is a base 8 numeral system It uses the numerals 0 through 7 The system is similar to binary and hexadecimal Octal numerals are written using the letter o before the numeral for example o04 or o1242

At one time the octal system was used mainly for work with computers It provided an easier way to work with binary numbers As computers changed from using 24 bit systems to 32 and 64 bit systems hexadecimal replaced octal for most uses Certain groups for example Native Americans using the Yuki language in California and the Pamean languages in Mexico also use an octal numbering system They do this because when they count they use the spaces between their fingers instead of counting the actual fingers

The octal numeral system uses a three bit binary coding Each digit in an octal numeral is the same as three digits in a binary numeral The grouping of the binary digits is done from right to left The first three binary digits from the right are grouped into the last part of the octal numeral then the next three digits form the next to the last part of the numeral

In the decimal system each digit in octal is equal to that digit multiplied by the exponent of 8 that is equal to its location minus one

Example o3425 to decimal

Octal is similar to hexadecimal because they are both easily converted to binary Where octal is equal to three digit binary hexadecimal is equal to four digit binary Where octal numerals start with the letter o hexadecimal numerals end with the letter h The easiest way to convert from one to the other is to convert to binary and then to the other system

A radical is the portion bearing the meaning of an inflected European word in Chinese Early Western sinologists borrowed this term to refer to the semantic component of a Chinese character Later the term was also borrowed for a second meaning the This literally means section header It refers to the place where a character is listed in the dictionary 

For example in the character m or mother the left part happens to be the semantic component and also the section header under which dictionaries list the graph However not all section headers function in a particular character as the semantic component some are based on phonetics while others are merely chosen for convenience and play neither a semantic nor a phonetic role These two meanings of radical are not synonymous though they may coincide in a particular example causing a great deal of confusion

The equivalents in cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphics are called determinatives

Trygve Halvdan Lie was a Norwegian politician From 1946 to 1952 he was the first elected Secretary General of the United Nations

Lie was born in Oslo on 16 July 1896 He joined the Labour Party in 1911 and was named as the partys national secretary soon after getting his law degree from the University of Oslo in 1919 He married Hjrdis Jrgensen in 1921 the couple had three daughters Sissel Guri and Mette

Later he was elected to the Storting He was appointed Minister of Justice when a Labour Party government was formed by Johan Nygaardsvold in 1935 Lie was later named Minister of Trade and Industries and Minister of Supply and Shipping

In 1940 when Norway was invaded by Germany Lie ordered all Norwegian ships to sail to Allied ports Lie was named as Foreign Minister of the Norwegian government in exile

Lie led the Norwegian delegation to the United Nations conference in San Francisco in 1946 and was a leader in drafting the rules to set up the United Nations Security Council He was the leader of the Norwegian delegation to the United Nations general assembly in 1946 On February 1 1946 he was elected as the first United Nations Secretary General as a result of a compromise between the major powers having only missed being elected President of the first General Assembly by a small margin He gets much of the credit for securing the current site for the United Nations headquarters from John D Rockefeller Jr and establishing the offices there

As Secretary General Lie supported the foundation of Israel and Indonesia He worked for the withdrawal of Soviet forces in Iran and a stop to fighting in Kashmir He attracted the anger of the Soviet Union when he helped gather support for the defence of South Korea after it was invaded in 1950 and later worked to end the Soviet boycott of UN meetings though his involvement has only little to do with the eventual return of the Soviet Union to the UN He was opposed to Spains entry into the United Nations because of his opposition to the Franco government He also sought to have the Peoples Republic of China recognized by the United Nations after the Nationalist government was exiled to Taiwan arguing that the Peoples Republic was the only government which could fulfill the membership obligations in full This did not happen until the 1970s

He has been criticized for his failures to facilitate negotiation in the Berlin Blockade as well as his failure to bring about a more swift end to the Korean War His critics argue that he was under the influence of a select few in the UN Secretariat He has also been criticized for his arrogance and stubbornness

Over objections from the Soviet Union his term of office was extended by the General Assembly 46  5 in 1950 This was the result of a Security Council impasse in which the US refused to accept any candidate but Lie and the Soviet Unions absolute refusal to accept him again due to his involvement in the Korean War The Soviet Union refused to acknowledge him as secretary general in his second term and after having been accused by Joseph McCarthy of hiring disloyal Americans Lie resigned on November 10 1952

Lie remained active in Norwegian politics after his resignation from the UN He was the Governor of Oslo and Akershus Chairman of the Board of Energy Minister of the Interior and Minister of Trade

Lie died on December 30 1968 of a heart attack He was 72 years old

U Thant 22 January 1909 25 November 1974 was a Burmese diplomat and the third Secretary General of the United Nations from 1961 to 1971 He was chosen after his predecessor Dag Hammarskjld was killed in a plane crash in September 1961

U is a word in Burmese roughly equal to Mister Thant was his only name In Burmese he was known as Pantanaw U Thant His home town is Pantanaw so this means Mr Thant of Pantanaw

When U Nu became the Prime Minister of the newly independent Burma he asked Thant to join him in Rangoon and appointed him as Director of Broadcasting in 1948 In the following year he was appointed Secretary to the Government of Burma in the Ministry of Information From 1951 to 1957 Thant was Secretary to the Prime Minister He also took part in a number of international conferences and was the secretary of the first Asian African summit in 1955 at Bandung Indonesia which gave birth to the Non Aligned Movement

From 1957 to 1961 he was Burmas Permanent Representative to the United Nations and became actively involved in negotiations over Algerian independence In 1960 the Burmese government awarded him the title Maha Thray Sithu as a commander in the Pyidaungsu Sithu Thingaha Order

Thant began serving as Acting Secretary General from November 3 1961 when he was unanimously appointed by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council to fill the unexpired term of Dag Hammarskjld He was then unanimously appointed Secretary General by the General Assembly on November 30 1962 for a term of office ending on November 3 1966 During this first term he was widely credited for his role in defusing the Cuban Missile Crisis and for ending the civil war in the Congo

U Thant was appointed to a second term as Secretary General of the United Nations by the General Assembly on December 2 1966 on the unanimous recommendation of the Security Council His term of office continued until December 31 1971 when he retired During his time in office he oversaw the entry into the UN of dozens of new Asian and African states and was a firm opponent of apartheid in South Africa He also established many of the UNs development and environmental agencies funds and programmes including the UN Development Programme the UN University UNCTAD UNITAR and the UN Environmental Programme

He had also led many successful though now largely forgotten peace making efforts for example in Yemen in 1962 and Bahrain in 1968 In each case war would have provoked a wider regional conflict and it was Thants quiet mediation which prevented war

Unlike his two predecessors Thant retired after ten years on speaking terms with all the big powers In 1961 when he was first appointed the Soviet Union had tried to insist on a troika formula of three Secretaries General one representing each Cold War bloc something which would have maintained equality in the United Nations between the superpowers By 1966 when Thant was reappointed all the big powers in a unanimous vote of the Security Council affirmed the importance of the Secretary Generalship and his good offices a clear tribute to Thants work

The Six Day War between Arab countries and Israel the Prague Spring and subsequent Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and the Indo Pakistani War of 1971 leading to the birth of Bangladesh all took place during his time as Secretary General

He was widely criticized in the US and Israel for agreeing to pull UN troops out of the Sinai in 1967 in response to a request from Egyptian President Nasser U Thant tried to persuade Nasser not to go to war with Israel by flying to Cairo in a last minute peace effort

His once good relationship with the US government deteriorated rapidly when he publicly criticized American conduct of the Vietnam War His secret attempts at direct peace talks between Washington and Hanoi were eventually rejected by the Johnson Administration

Thant followed unidentified flying object reports with some interest in 1967 he arranged for American atmospheric physicist Dr James E McDonald to speak before the UNs Outer Space Affairs Group regarding UFOs

On January 23 1971 U Thant categorically announced that he would under no circumstances be available for a third term as Secretary General For many weeks the UN Security Council was deadlocked over the search for a successor before finally settling on Kurt Waldheim to succeed U Thant as Secretary General on December 21 1971 Waldheims 53rd birthday and just ten days before U Thants second term was to have ended

In his farewell address to the United Nations General Assembly Secretary General U Thant stated that he felt a great sense of relief bordering on liberation on relinquishing the burdens of office In an editorial published around December 27 1971 praising U Thant The New York Times stated that the wise counsel of this dedicated man of peace will still be needed after his retirement The editorial was entitled The Liberation of U Thant

U Thant died of lung cancer in New York on November 25 1974 By this time Burma was ruled by a military junta which refused him any honors The then Burmese President Ne Win was envious of U Thants international stature and the respect that was accorded him by the Burmese populace Ne Win also resented U Thants close links with the democratic government of U Nu which Ne Win had overthrown in a coup detat on March 2 1962 Ne Win ordered that U Thant be buried without any official involvement or ceremony

From the United Nations headquarters in New York U Thants body was flown back to Rangoon but no guard of honour or high ranking officials were on hand at the airport when the coffin arrived

On the day of U Thants funeral on December 5 1974 tens of thousands of people lined the streets of Rangoon to pay their last respects to their distinguished countryman whose coffin was displayed at Rangoons Kyaikasan race course for a few hours before the scheduled burial

The coffin of U Thant was then snatched by a group of students just before it was scheduled to leave for burial in an ordinary Rangoon cemetery The student demonstrators buried U Thant on the former grounds of the Rangoon University Students Union which Ne Win had dynamited and destroyed on July 8 1962

During the period of December 5 through December 11 1974 the student demonstrators also built a temporary mausoleum for U Thant on the grounds of the RUSU and gave anti government speeches In the early morning hours of December 11 1974 government troops stormed the campus killed some of the students guarding the make shift mausoleum removed U Thants coffin and reburied it at the foot of the Shwedagon Pagoda where it has continued to lie

Upon hearing of the storming of the Rangoon University campus and the forcible removal of U Thants coffin many people rioted in the streets of Rangoon Martial law was declared in Rangoon and the surrounding metropolitan areas What has come to be known as the U Thant crisis the student led protests over the shabby treatment by the Ne Win government of U Thant was crushed by the Burmese government

In 1978 U Thants memoirs View from the UN was published by the American publishing house Doubleday

The farrier assists the Regimental Veterinary Officer in of taking care of the horses When the farrier is mounted on parade he carries the traditional symbol of an axe In battle one of the farriers jobs was to kill horses that were badly injured They also had to cut off one of the hooves so that there was proof of the horses death so that a new one could be purchased The horses are all black three quareter bred Irish draught horses except for the trumpeters horses which are grey and the drumhorses which are large draught horses They are almost invariably coloured horses Shires or Clydesdales and are piebald skewbald or roan The drumhorses each carry two solid silver kettle drums on parade

The trumpeter whose job is to relay messages by trumpet can be told apart because he does not wear a cuirrass and has a grey horse On State occasions when The Queen or another member of the Royal Family is present the bands of The Household Cavalry wear gold coats designed at the time of King Charles II made of gold braid and dark blue velvet jockey hats Each regiment has its own Quick March and Slow March They both use a Scottish tune the Keel Row for a ceremonial trot past

The Household Cavalry Regiment is an armoured reconnaissance regiment based in Windsor Most Household Cavalry soldiers begin their careers on mounted duty before being posted normally after about two years at ceremonial duty to the reconnaissance regiment which is equipped with Scimitar light tanks where they are trained in driving gunnery ands signals This regiment has deployed more than almost any other in the British Army to operations in Bosnia Kosovo Iraq and Afghanistan Gallantry medals awarded to soldiers of the Household Cavalry since 2003 include a George Cross to Trooper Christopher Finney of The Blues and Royals a Conspicuous Gallantry Cross and a Military Cross to Staff Corporal Michael Flynn of The Blues and Royals a CGC to Lance Corporal of Horse Andrew Radford a Distinguished Service Order to Major Richard Taylor of The Life Guards and MCs to Captain Paddy Williams of The Blues and Royals and to Staff Corporal Shaun Fry of The Life Guards All these were awarded on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan

Pica is an eating disorder where a person wants to eat things that are not normal to eat for example nails rocks or feces A person with Pica may also have a strong want to eat unusual things that are normally considered food but not in the normal way for example uncooked potatoes flour or starch

Camillo Berneri was an Italian professor of philosophy anarchist militant propagandist and theorist

Berneri a World War I veteran University of Florence professor of humanities and a member of the Unione Anarchica Italiana fought always Fascists and he started to fight fascism until1926 when he was forced to escape from Italy and he went in France then Switzerland Germany Belgium Luxembourg and finally the Netherlands In all these countries Berneri was frequently placed under arrest and then often expelled because he was an anarchist When he was in these countries he wrote lot of anti clerical and anti fascist articles

With Carlo Rosselli Berneri organized the first troop of Italian volunteers to fight in the Spanish Civil War against Francisco Franco After months he became highly critical of the involvement of Confederacin Nacional del Trabajo members in the Popular Front government and he sent a letter to Federica Montseny

During the Barcelona May Days as troop of Communist Party of Spain members searched and than murdered him His body riddled with bullets was found during the night near the headquarters of the Generalitat de Catalunya

He was married to Giovanna Berneri and was father of Marie Louise Berneri and Giliane Berneri the childrens were anarchists as the father Camillo

In context with theatre and movies a scenario is a description of an event or series of actions and events In the Commedia dellarte it was an outline of entrances exits and action describing the story of a play that was literally pinned to the back of the scenery 

Surviving scenari from the Renaissance contain little other than character names brief descriptions of action and references to specific lazzi with no further explanation It is believed that a scenario forms the basis of a fully improvisational performance though it is also likely that they were simple reminders of the plot for those members of the cast who were literate 

In the creation of an opera or ballet a scenario is often developed initially to indicate how the original source if any is to be adapted This sketch can be helpful in pitching the idea to a prospective producer director or composer

In policy planning and generally when organizations wish to test strategies against uncertain future developments a scenario is also an account or synopsis of a projected course of action events or situations Scenarios are widely used by organizations of all types to understand different ways that future events might unfold

Arthur David Waley was a famous English Orientalist and Sinologist 

Waley was born in Tunbridge Wells Kent England as Arthur David Schloss He changed his surname to the maiden name of his grandmother Waley in 1914 because he was a Jew He was appointed Assistant Keeper of Oriental Prints and Manuscripts at the British Museum in 1913 During this time he taught himself Chinese and Japanese In 1929 he left to concentrate himself fully to his literary and cultural interests

Oriental studies include Near Eastern and Far Eastern societies and cultures languages and peoples and their histories in recent years the term Asian studies has mostly replaced the older term European study of the region had primarily religious origins which has remained an important motivation until recent times 

Lev Chernyi was a Russian anarchist poet who was imprisoned in Siberia under the Russian Czarist regime for his revolutionary activities 

In 1907 he published a book entitled Associational Anarchism in which he speak about the free association of independent individuals Chernyi was greatly influenced by individualist anarchist Max Stirner

On his return from Siberia in 1917 he enjoyed great popularity among Moscow workers He was also Secretary of the Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups which was formed in March 1917 

In the spring of 1918 in reaction to the growing repression of all opposition and free expression the anarchist groups within the Moscow Federation formed armed gangs the Black Guards and Lev Chernyi played an active part in these 

On the night of April 11 1918 the Cheka the secret police attacked the building of the Moscow Federation and the Black Guards offered armed resistance About forty anarchists were killed or striked and about five hundred were imprisoned 

In 1919 Chernyi joined a group called the Underground Anarchists who published two numbers of a broadsheet which denounced the Communist dictatorship as the biggest tyranny in human history On September 25 1919 a little group of social revolutionaries and anarchists bombed the headquarters of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party in protest at the growing repression Twelve Communists were killed and forty five others were mutilated 

August 1921 the Moscow Izvestia published an official report announcing that ten anarchist bandits had been shot without hearing or trial Among the dead was Lev Chernyi although Paul Avrich indicates in two of his books on the Russian anarchists that Chernyi was executed in September of that year not August Although he was not involved in the bombing of the Moscow Communist headquarters he was because of his association with the Underground Anarchists a likely candidate for a frame up The Communists refused to turn over his body to his family for burial and there were persistent rumors that he had in fact died of torture

Luigi Fabbri was an Italian anarchist writer agitator and propagandist who was charged with defeatism during the World War I He was the father of Luce Fabbri

Born in Fabriano Italy in 1877 Fabbri was first sentenced for anarchist activities at the age of 16 in Ancona and spent many years in and out of Italian prisons Fabbri was a long time supporter of to the anarchist press in Europe and later South America including co editing with Errico Malatesta the paper LAgitazione He helped edit the paper Universit popolare in MilanFabbri was a delegate to the International Anarchist Congress held in Amsterdam in 1907 He died in Montevideo Uruguay in 1935

Francesc Ferrer y Gurdia was a Spanish Catalan free thinker and anarchist

He was born in Alella A supporter of Spanish republican leader Ruiz Zorilla Ferrer was exiled to Paris with his wife and children in 1885 Divorcing his first wife in 1899 he remarried a wealthy Parisian teacher some time after

In 1901 he returned to Spain and opened la Escuela Moderna to teach middle class children radical social values the school was free In 1906 he was arrested and accused of helping with Mateu Morrals attack on King Alphonso XIII and released a year later His school failed and closed while he was incarcerated

Early in the summer of 1908 after his release from jail he wrote the story of the Modern School The book was called The Origins and Ideals of the Modern School and was translated into English by Joseph McCabe and published by the Knickerbocker Press in 1913

When the martial law was reused in 1909 during the Tragic Week he was arrested and executed without any proof by firing squad at Montjuich Fortress in Barcelona on October 13

After his execution numerous supporters of Ferrers ideas in the United States formed what were called Modern Schools or Ferrer Schools The first and most important Modern School was formed in New York City in 1911 and then later a community was founded around a school known as Ferrer Colony and Modern School

Gaetano Bresci was an Italian American anarchist who killed Italian King Umberto I He is still considered a hero by many anarchists and republicans

Bresci was born in Tuscany and he went from Italy to the United States he lived for many time Paterson New Jersey where there was a large Italian American community He was one of the founders of La Questione Sociale the Italian language anarchist paper published in Paterson 

In 1898 the high bread prices led to demonstrations all over Italy In Milan an unarmed group of workers women and children marched together for protesting near the palace which was surrounded by a strong military force under command of General Fiorenzo Bava Beccaris The people ignored the order to stop so the General gave the signal of fire with rifles and cannons resulting in a massacre of innocent people Ninety people died one of whom was Brescis sister

King Humbert later decorated Bava Beccaris and the king after said thanks to himfor the defense of the royal housethe king did not do anything for the innocent people died he decorated the murtder this is the reason that made Bresci determined to kill the kingBresci had his loan to the paper returned and with the money he went to Italy In Monza where the king was visiting on July 29 1900 he shot him three times

Bresci was captured and put on trial where he was defended by the anarchist lawyer Francesco Saverio Merlino He was sentenced in Milan on August 29 1900 to life imprisonment on the jail of Santo Stefano Island near Ventotene where lot of other anarchists had also been sent over the years Less than a year later he was found dead in prison It is not clear whether he committed suicide as officially announced or whether he was murdered by his guards

A diode is an electronic component with two electrodes which a signal can flow between

The most common function of a diode is to allow an electric current to flow in one direction and to block it in the opposite direction

Today the most common diodes are made from semiconductor materials such as silicon or germanium

Here are some common semiconductor diode symbols used in schematic diagrams

The first types of diodes were called Fleming valves They worked inside a glass tube Inside the glass bulb there was a small metal wire and a large metal plate The small metal wire would heat up and emit electricity which was captured by the plate However the large metal plate would not heat up enough to emit electricity because it was too big So electricity could go in one direction through the tube but not in the reverse direction Flemming valves are mostly obsolete now because they have been replaced by semiconductor diodes

Semiconducting diodes are usually made of two types of semiconducting metals connected to each other One type of metal has atoms connected together with a few electrons to spare The other metal has atoms connected together and needs a few electrons to be complete Because one metal has too many electrons and the other metal has too few the electricity will flow easily from the metal with too many electrons into the metal with too few However electricity will not flow easily in the reverse direction  from the metal with too few electrons to the metal with too many Silicon with arsenic dissolved in it makes a good metal with electrons to spare while silicon with aluminum dissolved in it makes a good metal with too few electrons to be complete There are actually many types of combinations of metals that will make p type and n type semiconductors

If you give positive voltage to the p side and negative voltage to the n side the electrons from the n side will want to go to the positive voltage at the p side and the holes of the p side will want to go to the negative voltage at the n side Because of this current flow is able to exist This is called breakdown The breakdown voltage of a silicon diode is at about 07 V A germanium diode needs a breakdown voltage at about 03 V

If you give negative voltage to the p side and positive voltage to the n side the electrons of the n side go to the negative voltage at the n side The holes of the p side go to the positive voltage at the p side So there will not be a current flow between p and n side If you give too much voltage to the diode in negative direction the diode will be destroyed

When the temperature increases the voltage needed for the breakdown to happen goes down

The standard rectifier diode is the actual original diode It has different requirements It should have high current densities in the forward area and a high barrier permissible temperature It should also have a minimum passing voltage and a high cut off frequency You should also have a high blocking voltage whereby the blocking flows should remain low Their applications are the whole modern analog and digital electronics Especially it becomes straightening of changing and turning tension and to limit power supply voltage used The diode is often needed for measurement and drive 

The Z diode operates in the direction lock and so the direction of their work area is located in the 3rd Quadrant In working towards the passage it is like a normal diode The name comes from Zenereffekt the man with the name Zener discovered The term Z diode is only a shortcut A Z diode can vary how high it is doped and then has different properties breakthrough With a high allocation to the diode it has a low and a small space charge zone Is it high it works with Zener tunneleffect At low doping it has a large breakdown voltage and space charge zone and works with the avalanche effect For medium doping is the breakdown voltage 5 8 volts and there are two effects Z diodes are best suited to stabilize voltage for circuits with low power consumption But the limitation of voltage spikes is a possibility to use it With appropriate Zener voltage they can be used as donors in nominal value of measuring and control technology or where reference voltages are required It can also be used as a protective diode

Top diodes are actually the exact opposite of junction diodes They have a small barrier layer capacity and are also in high frequency applications up to several GHz But they must ensure only at low currents and voltages to operate As a particular example the gold wire germanium diode is mentioned Junction diodes have a p n transition over a large area and are often made of silicon They are designed for high currents and voltages Because they have a pretty big barrier layer capacity they are not suitable for high frequency applications A specific example of the application is called the power diode 

The capacity diode is a semiconductor diode barrier in the direction of running so does the barrier layer or space charge zone on pn transition as a capacity If the voltage on the diode is changing then the capacity of the barrier will change too Then you look at the capacity diode you see the barrier layer capacity is especially great Because of the capacity variation can be set 3 different p n transitions With a 13 ratio it is a linear transition in an abrupt 16 and 130 a hyper abrupt p n transition They are used as a substitute for rotary capacitors for the swing vote in the district of radios and televisions and they will also find use in circuits for the generation of frequency modulation

The symbol of this diode is the usual symbol of a diode with a kind of snag

It is especially used in circuits with high frequencies up to GHz The idea is to work with the current that flows after the polarity was reversed It has also an intrinsic layer between the p and the n layer After the polarization has changed there develops a layer without carriers That means there is a layer that is almost not conducting So you can achieve a high slew rate This diode is used with high gigahertz frequencies

This diode has no special symbol The construction of this diode is that there s not only a pn junction but also an intrinsic layer between the n and the p layer This means this layer is nearly nonconducting If it s forward biased especially at lower frequencies it has almost the same characteristics as a usual standard diode But if it runs in reverse direction there develops two space charge regions with different extensions Because of this broad space charge region in the i zone the i zone becomes very conductive The pin diode is useful for a high block voltage It s a quite fast diode and also used at very high frequencies

The symbol if this diode is the usual symbol with a S at the peak

It consists of a pn junction with a metal layer which is oxidized on the n doped silicon This metal can be eg aluminum or nickel In forward direction the threshold voltage is about 03 volt This is about half of the threshold voltage of a usual diode The function of this diode is that no minority carriers are injected So there s no diffusion capacitance because there are no carriers that could diffuse This explains why this diode is a very fast one So it is always used when speed plays a role The advantage of this diode is that it is faster but has otherwise no restrictions and works like a usual diode The only disadvantage is it isn t appropriate in reverse direction

In the symbol of the tunnel diode there s a kind of additional square bracket at the end of the usual symbol

A tunnel diode consists of a high doped pn junction That means both the n and the p layer are high doped Because of this high doping there is only a very narrow gap where the electrons are able to pass through This so called tunnel effect appears in both directions After a certain amount of electrons have passed the current through the gap decreases until the normal current through the diode at the threshold voltage begins This causes an area of a negative differential resistance These diodes are used to deal with really high frequencies and are of course mostly used in the area of the negative differential resistance

The symbol has at the end of the diode a sign that looks like a big I

This diode has a construction that is similar to the tunnel diode but the n and the p layer aren t doped as high It works with small negative voltages because it has no threshold voltage in the third quadrant The current increases immediately there From this reason this diode works in most times in this area

The power trio is a popular type of a rock and roll band format since the 1960s The usual power trio has three people playing the guitar bass and drums It does not include the rhythm guitar or keyboard often included in other rock music In more recent years the term has come to mean any type of a three person band

The Pomp and Circumstance Marches are a group of five marches for orchestra composed by Sir Edward Elgar Their full title is Pomp and Circumstance Military Marches Elgar started to write a sixth march but never finished it

The first of the marches is especially famous and has a tune which is one of the best known tunes in Britain It is often sung to the words Land of Hope and Glory

The title Pomp and Circumstanceis taken from Act III Scene iii of Shakespeares Othello

The Pomp and Circumstance marches are

The first five were all published by Boosey Co as Elgars Op 39 Elgar dedicated each march to one of his musical friends

Each march takes about five minutes to play

 March No 1 in D  is the best known of the set It was completed together with March No 2 in 1901 soon after the first performance of his Dream of Gerontius which had been badly performed Elgar dedicated it to Alfred Rodewald who conducted its first performance with the Liverpool Orchestra Society on 19 October 1901 Both marches were played two days later at a Promenade Concert in the Queens Hall London conducted by Henry Wood Elgar knew that the audience would love the big tune in the middle of March No 1 so that march was played second Henry Wood tells in his autobiography that the people simply rose and yelled I had to play it again with the same result in fact they refused to let me get on with the programmemerely to restore order I played the march a third time 

The next year King Edward VII was due to be crowned in June The King liked the big tune and wanted it performed with words at the coronation So Elgar used it at the end of his Coronation Ode with words by AC Benson The coronation did not take place because the king became ill just before the big day Land of Hope and Glory was sung in June 1902 by Clara Butt and the whole Ode was performed in Sheffield four months later

In Britain Land of Hope and Glory is sung every year at the Last Night of the Proms in the Royal Albert Hall as part of the Pomp and Circumstance March No 1

The words are

In the United States the tune is sometimes known as Pomp and Circumstance or as The Graduation March and is played as the processional tune at high school and college graduation ceremonies

 March No 2 in A minor  was dedicated to the composer Granville Bantock It was first performed at the same concert as March No 1 It the shortest and simplest of the marches

 March No 3 in C minor  was finished in November 1904 and published in 1905 It was dedicated to Ivor Atkins It was first performed on 8 March 1905 in the Queens Hall London conducted by the composer It sounds quite serious at first then it becomes very energetic

 March No 4 in G  is very grand like No 1 Again there is a big tune in the middle It was dedicated to Dr G Robertson Sinclair the organist of Hereford Cathedral It was first performed on 24 August 1907 in the Queens Hall London conducted by Elgar himself

 March No 5 in C composed in 1930 was dedicated to Percy Hull a friend from Hereford It has some brilliant orchestral effects

 March No 6 in G minor  was started but when Elgar died there were only sketches left The musician Anthony Payne recently discovered some more sketches for it in the library of the Royal School of Church Music He finished composing in the way that Elgar might have done and the work was first performed on 2 August 2006 with Andrew Davis conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra at The Proms at Royal Albert Hall 

Louise Michel was a French anarchist school teacher and medical worker She sometimes used the pseudonym Clmence and was also known as the red virgin of Montmartre

Louise Michel was born at the Chteau of Vroncourt on 29 May 1830 the daughter of Marianne Michel and of Etienne Charles Demahis She was brought up by her fathers parents and received a libertaria education After her grandfathers death in 1850 she was trained to teach but after few times she saw that Napoleon III prevented her from serving in a state school She became violently anti Bonapartist and is said to have thought about the assassination of Napoleon III She became anarchist in 1866 to a school in the Montmartre quarter of Paris where she saw that his destiny was to work for charity and follow the revolution

She was active during the Paris Commune as an ambulance woman she helped mutilated or injured on the barricades During the Siege of Paris she was in resistance against the Prussians On the establishment of the Commune she joined the National Guard She offered to shoot Thiers and suggested the destruction of Paris for its surrender

She was with the Communards who made their last stand in the cemetery of Montmartre and was closely allied with Thophile Ferr who was executed in November 1871 Michel dedicated a moving farewell poem to Ferr lillet rouge It is without a doubt that upon learning of this loss Victor Hugo dedicated his poem to Michel Viro Major This ardent attachment was perhaps one of the sources of the exaltation which marked her career and gave many handles to her enemies After December 1871 she was making propaganda for help poor peopletrying to destroy the government and supporting people to arm themselves and herself using weapons and wearing a military uniform She never renounced the Commune and few times later the judges to sentence her to death She spent twenty months in prison and was sentenced to deportation

She was pun onto the ship Virginie on the 8th of August 1873 to be deported to New Caledonia where she arrived 4 months later On board she met Henri Rochefort a famous polemist who became her friend until her death She also met Nathalie Lemel another figure active in the commune Louise rest in New Caledonia for seven years refusing special treatment reserved for women After in 1878 she was a leader in a revolt The following year she received authorisation to become a teacher in Noumea for the children of the deportedamong them many Kabyles from Cheikh Mokranis rebellionand later in schools for girls

Michel returned to Paris in 1880 after amnesty was granted to the Communards Her revolutionary never died and she controlled freely a libertarian schoolShe travelled everywhere in France supporting revolution and in 1883 she led a Paris mob which pillaged a bakers shop For this she was condemned to six years imprisonment but was released in 1886 at the same time as Kropotkin and other prominent anarchists After a short period of freedom she was again arrested for speaking bad about the social system

She was soon free again but hearing that her enemies hoped to put her in a lunatic asylum she went to England in 1890 She returned to France in 1895 taking part in the revolt made by the Dreyfuss affair in 1898Few months ago she was constantly followed by the police until she died in Room 11 in the Hotel Oasis Marseilles on January 10 1905

Michel became highly admired by French workers and revolutionaries particularly for her association with the Paris Commune From after her death until 1916 a demonstration was held every year at her tomb at Levallois PerretFrequently the language used to describe her is that reserved for saints and heretics she is often referred to as Bonne Louise or the Vierge rouge She was always respected same in periods when women were without right

On May 1 1946 the Parisian mtro station Vallier was renamed Louise Michel see Louise Michel

Louise Michel is a station of the Paris Mtro serving Line 3 It is located in the commune of Levallois Perret northwest of the French capital Paris

Before 1946 this station was named Vallier after a mountainin the Pyrenees near the Val dAran 

The station was renamed on May 1 1946 to Louise Michel in honour of the French anarchist and communarde

Two battalions of French speaking people in the International Brigades of the Spanish Civil War against fascism were named after Louise Michel a heroine of the 1871 Paris Commune

The Catholic Encyclopedia or the Old Catholic Encyclopedia is an English language encyclopedia It was published by The Encyclopedia Press The first volume appeared in March 1907 It was completed in April 1914

The encyclopedia was designed for the Roman Catholic Church It does not include information which has nothing to do with the Church It explains matters from the point of view of the official Catholic doctrine as it was during the time of Pope Pius X It tells the accomplishments of Catholics and some others in nearly all intellectual and professional pursuits These include artists educators poets and scientists

Numismatics is the study and collecting of coins and the history behind the coins A Numismatist is either a collector of coins or a scholar who studies the history of coins

The term comes from a word meaning of coins The original word is French which itself is from a Latin origin

Coin collectors may have existed in ancient times Caesar Augustus may have been an example The first known book about coin collecting was in 1514 De Asse et Partibus by Guillaume Bud However only royalty really enjoyed coin collecting until the 19th century Thats when professional organizations started to sprout like the American Numismatic Society in 1858

Modern numismatics is a sub field that focuses on when coins started being stamped by machines Because of its focus modern numismatics is more popular with collectors than with historians Other subfieldsvariants include exonumia notaphily and scripophily

Philately is the study and collection of postage stamps

 The Archbishopric of Salzburg was a state of the Holy Roman Empire Archbishop of Salzburg as a Prince Bishop This means the archbishop had his ecclesiatical powers and also the powers of an he Archbishopric was about the same size as the modern state of Salzburg in Austria

The most famous Archbishop was probably the last to rule as a prince He was Hieronymus von Colloredo who was an early patron of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart

In 450 a book was written about the live of St Severinus of Noricum The book said that Salzburg had two churches and a monastery St Maxius is the only abbot bishop known by name Soon after Maxius was martyred Salzburg was destroyed soon after in about 482

St Rupert later went back to Salzburg to set up the churches again He saw the ruins of Salzburg overgrown with brambles but no one knows whether he arrived about 543 during the time of Theodo I or in about 698 when Bavaria was conquered by the Franks

It was not until after 700 that Christian civilisation started to grow again in the region The cathedral monastery was named in honour of St Peter and Ruperts niece Ehrentrudis founded the nunnery at Nonnberg

Arno Archbishop of Salzburg enjoyed the respect of the Frankish king Charlemagne Charlemagne asked him to make the land between the Danube the Raab and Drave Rivers Christian This area ad recently been taken from the Avars Monasteries were founded and all of Carinthia was slowly Christianised

While Arno was in Rome attending to some of Charlemagnes business in 798 Pope Leo III appointed him Archbishop over the other bishops in Bavaria When the dispute over the churchs border between Salzburg and Aquileia broke out Charlemagne declared the River Drave to be the border Arno also began the copying of 150 volumes from the court of Charlemagne This was the start of the first library in Austria

The first archbishop of the era was Gebhard who during the Investiture Controversy remained on the side of the Pope Because of this Gebhard was exiled for nine years but was allowed to return shortly before his death and was buried in Admont His successor Thimo was imprisoned for five years and suffered a horrible death in 1102 After King Henry IV abdicated and Conrad I of Abensberg was elected Archbishop Conrad lived in exile until the Calistine Concordat of 1122

The Archbishops again took the side of the Pope during the arguments between the Pope and the Hohenstaufens Archbishop Eberard I of Hilpolstein Biburg was allowed to reign in peace but his successor Conrad II of Austria made the Emperors angry and died in 1168 in Admont trying to hide from the Emperor Conrad III of Wittelsbach was appointed the Archbishop of Salzburg in 1177 at the Diet of Venice after the supporters of both Pope and Emperor were deposed

Archbishop Eberard II of Truchsess was made a prince of the Empire in 1213 and created three new sees Chiemsee Seckau and Lavant Eberard was excommunicated in 1245 after refusing to publish a decree deposing the emperor Eberard died suddenly the next year During the German Interregnum Salzburg also suffered confusion Philip of Carinthia was made ruler of Salzburg but refused to become a priest This meant he could not be Archbishop so he was deposed by Ulrich Bishop of Seckau

King Rudolph I of Habsburg quarrelled with the archbishops The arguments wer started by Abbot Henry of Admont After Henry died the archbishops and the Habsburgs made peace in 1297 The people and archbishops of Salzburgs remained loyal to the Habsburgs in their struggles against the Wittelsbachs When the Black Death reached Salzburg in 1347 the Jews were accused of poisoning the wells and suffered severe persecution The Jews were expelled from Salzburg in 1404 Later the Jews were allowed to return but were forced to wear pointed hats Although the Renaissance was a time when new paintings sculptures and music was being made across Europe this did not happen in Salzburg because the archbishops were not got rulers and because of poor conditions in the empire during the reign of Frederick IV

Conditions were at their worst during the reign of Bernard II of Rohr The country was in depression local authorities were raising their own taxes and the Turks were attackingthe archdiocese In 1473 he summoned the first provincial diet in the history of the archbishopric and eventually abdicated It was only Leonard of Keutschach who changedthe situation He had all the burgermeisters and town councillors arrested at the same time and imprisoned in the castle His last years were spent in bitter struggle against Matthus Lang of Wellenburg Bishop of Gurk who succeeded him in 1519

Archbishop Paris of Lodron led Salzburg to peace and prosperity during the Thirty Years War in which the rest of Germany was thoroughly devastated During the reign of Leopold Anthony of Firmian Protestants emerged more vigorously than before He invited the Jesuits to Salzburg and asked for help from the emperor and finally ordered the Protestants to recant or emigrate  about 30000 people left and settled in Wrttemberg Hanover and East Prussia and a few settled in Georgia in the United States of America The last Prince Archbishop Hieronymus of Colloredo is probably the most well known for his patronage of Mozart His reforms of the church and education alienated himself from the people

Most likely stone circles were used for rituals They might also have been used at calendars some stone circles are arranged so that certain sotnes are lit on special dates like the summer solstice

Standing stones are stones that are set into the ground vertically They were a feature of Neolithic people in the British Isles and Brittany but occur elsewhere in the world 

There may be single standing stones circles lines or groups of them Their dates are mostly from 4000 BC to 1500 BC Since Neolithic peoples did not have writing we know little about their use It is generally thought they had both practical and ceremonial or religious uses

Pottery that has been found near some of these stones suggest some of them in Europe belonged to the so called Beaker culture

The Black bread mold Rhizopus is a common type of fungus 

It grows and reproduces the same way that most moulds do In asexual reproduction the mould makes spores inside a sporangium When the spores are ready to leave and spread more mold the sporangium breaks open and lets the spores float out In sexual reproduction its hyphae touch the hyphae of another Rhizopus mycelium When they fuse they make round balls called zygospores After some time the zygospore makes another sporangium which then makes spores During this sexual process genetic recombination takes place as with all eukaryotes

The spores land on a place where they can turn into a new mould and begin to grow They very quickly start making hyphae small tendrils that look like roots Hyphae are not roots but part of the mycelium The mycelium is the main part of the mould and grows inside the bread Black bread mould grows fast when the temperature is higher than 15 degrees Celsius and lower than 20oC

Black bread mould is found in all countries of the world It is often found growing on bread and on soft fruits such as bananas and grapes Because the mould spores are airborne the mould can spread easily

A nebula which comes from the Latin word for mist or cloud is an interstellar cloud of dust hydrogen helium and other gases 

An interstellar cloud is dust plasma or ionised gas in a galaxy The Persian astronomer Abd al Rahman al Sufi mentioned a true nebula for the first time in his book Book of Fixed Stars He said that there was a little cloud near the Andromeda Galaxy

A nebula is usually made up of hydrogen gas and plasma It may be the first stage of a stars cycle but it may also be one of the last stages 

Many nebulae or stars form from the gravitational collapse of gas in the interstellar medium or ISM As the material collapses contracts massive stars may form in the center and their ultraviolet radiation ionises the surrounding gas making it visible at optical wavelengths 

Examples of these types of nebulae are the Rosette Nebula and the Pelican Nebula The size of these nebulae known as HII regions varies depending on the size of the original cloud of gas These are sites where star formation occurs The formed stars are sometimes known as a young loose cluster 

Some nebulae are formed as the result of supernova explosions the death throes of massive short lived stars The materials thrown off from the supernova explosion are ionized by the energy and the compact object that it can produce One of the best examples of this is the Crab Nebula in Taurus The supernova event was recorded in the year 1054 and is labelled SN 1054 The compact object that was created after the explosion lies in the center of the Crab Nebula and is a neutron star

Other nebulae may form as planetary nebulae This is the final stage of a low mass stars life like Earths Sun Stars with a mass up to 8 10 solar masses evolve into red giants and slowly lose their outer layers during pulsations in their atmospheres When a star has lost enough material its temperature increases and the ultraviolet radiation it emits can ionize the surrounding nebula that it has thrown off The nebula is 97 Hydrogen and 3 Helium with trace materials 

In the past galaxies and star clusters were also called nebulae

A Lunar eclipse is an astronomical phenomenon It happens when the moon passes through the shadow of the Earth Lunar eclipses happen about twice a year much more often than solar eclipses They also last longer than solar eclipses

During a lunar eclipse the Moon looks red brown You would probably think that the moon would be completely black because of Earths shadow but the reddish brown color is because of the fact that the Suns light reflects off of the Earth and is barely visible on the Moon

Like solar eclipses there are different types of lunar eclipses There are total eclipses where all of the moon appears reddish brown and partial ones where only part of the moon appears reddish brown

Lunar eclipses are not as rare as solar eclipses and are sometimes called the Yellow Moon although it does not look very yellow

A basilica is a large important church The word can also be used for an Ancient Roman building that was used for law and meetings The word basilica is Latin which was taken from the Greek Basilik Sto

Nowadays the word is used in three ways

A Roman basilica was a large hall built for meetings business and law A Roman basilica usually had the doors at the long sides of the building At each end was a semi circular part where the judges sat The building usually had two rows of columns which made a high central part and a lower aisle on either side The light came in from windows above the columns As the Roman Empire spread every city had a basilica

Early in the 4th century AD the Roman Emperor Constantine made Christianity the legal religion of the Roman Empire The Christians who had been worshipping secretly in private houses now wanted to build churches They did not want the churches to look the same as Roman Temples They built them to look more like Roman Basilicas A basilica was a good plan for a Christian church because lots of people could fit inside and the aisles were useful for people to move around The semi circular part at one end the apse was just right to put the altar Christian basilicas usually have the door at one end rather than at the side In front of the door there was often a courtyard called an atrium Most of these atriums have gone but churches often have a town square or a market place in front of them

Some of the oldest Early Christian basilicas were four that were begun in Rome by the Emperor Constantine Three of them are still standing but they have had many changes in the last 1700 years These are the basilicas of Santa Maria Maggiore St John Lateran and St Pauls outside the Walls The fourth basilica was Old St Peters which was replaced in the 16th and 17th centuries by the present St Peters Basilica Other Early Christian Basilicas were built in Greece and the Holy Land

Some basilicas are called Ancient Basilicas These have been called basilicas since Early Christian or Medieval times It is their traditional name Ancient Basilicas include the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna and the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Rome The four other ancient basilicas of Rome are called the Major Basilicas Each Major Basilica has a throne for the pope and an altar that is specially for the pope to celebrate mass No one else can use that altar without the popes permission All the other basilicas are called Minor Basilicas

Nowadays for a church to be called a Minor Basilica it has to be given some special privileges or rights by the pope in a document called a Papal Brief When a church has been made a basilica the clergy then carry some special symbols when they are in procession There are more than 1400 basilicas in the world

Some basilicas are built because a miracle or special sign took place The sign might be a vision The Basilica of Lourdes in France is built at the place where a girl who is now called St Bernadette had a vision of the Virgin Mary The basilica at Lourdes is one of the most important pilgrimage places in France Sometimes the sign is not so strange as a vision In the Philippines the Basilica del Santo Nio was built at the place where a partly burnt box was found in 1565 It contained a little statue of the Christ Child and had been left behind by some Spanish or Portuguese explorers many years earlier Santo Nio means Holy Child in Spanish

The four great Basilicas of Rome as well as having a seat and an altar for the pope have a Holy Door which is only opened for special occasions such as a Jubilee Year

A mudflow or mudslide occurs when mud travels down a slope very fast Mudflows which are like giant moving mud pies happen when lots of water mixes with soil and rock The water makes the slippery mass of mud flow quickly down Mudflows happen most in mountainous places where a long dry season is followed by heavy rains 

Mudflows of volcanic eruptions are the most dangerous and are called lahars A lahar is a type of mudflow or debris flow composed of a slurry of pyroclastic material rocky debris and water The material flows down from a volcano typically along a river valley Lahars can move as quickly as 80kmh and are as thick as liquid concrete

Lahars have several possible causes

Lahars can occur without volcanic activity if conditions are right for the collapse and movement of mud from existing volcanic ash deposits

A class is a part of a computer program that a programmer creates to represent a thing in a way that a computer can understand A class is written in a programming language and a programming language that can be used to write classes is called an Object oriented programming language Classes have fields which represent a quality the thing has and classes have methods which represent what a thing can do 

For example a class could be a car which could have a color field four tire fields and a drive method Another related class could be a truck which would have similar fields but not be exactly the same as a car Both a car and a truck could be a kind of a third class which could be called a vehicle class In this way the programmer could create the parts of the program that are the same for both the car and the truck in programming the vehicle class yet the programmer would be free to program how a car is different from a truck without duplicating all of the programming

In this example there are three classes 1 a class called car 2 a class called pick up truck and 3 a class called vehicle These classes would be used to make object Although there is only one class called car there could be many objects that are created from the class called car And although there is only one class that is called truck many objects of type truck could be created from this class The class vehicle is actually general and there would probably not be any objects that were only of the class vehicle But a car would be a kind of vehicle and a truck would also be a kind of vehicle So you could say that both cars and trucks are from the same class vehicle

Inside of classes are two kinds of things methods and fields Methods can store the code for doing actions in this example you could have a drive method and a brake method and maybe a turnRight and turnLeft method Fields store data you could have a color field a speed field and a size field You can call methods by first making an object of the Car or Truck class and call it for example ferrari and doing ferrarimethodName In this case if we wanted to make the vehicle move we could do ferraridrive 

The Loggerhead Sea Turtle or Loggerhead is a type of turtle that lives in the sea It is from the animal family Cheloniidae Its other name is Caretta caretta This name comes from the French word caret which means sea turtle 

Loggerheads live in the seas around the world Most of the beaches where Loggerheads lay eggs are found on the coasts of the United States in North America Oman in Asia and Australia in the Pacific Ocean Some Loggerheads also live near other countries like Chile Greece and Indonesia

Loggerheads eat fish squid jellyfish crabs and other small sea animals Loggerheads mate while they are moving in the seas mostly from March to June every 2 or 3 years When they are ready to lay eggs female Loggerheads always come back to the same beach where they came out of their eggs as babies Most loggerheads lay eggs in June and July Most lay between 100 and 126 eggs The eggs look much like ping pong balls

When they come out of the eggs baby Loggerheads are called hatchlings They usually come out at night so that other animals like birds and crabs do not eat them The hatchlings follow light from the morning sun to the sea They swim out to parts of the ocean that have seaweed to hide from other animals while they grow

Most Loggerheads move to warm waters during months that are colder but some hibernate or sleep for long times when it is cold When they are hibernating they can stay under the water for up to seven hours before coming up for air

Loggerheads live 30 to 50 years or more

In the past Loggerhead Sea Turtles were hunted by people for meat and for their eggs Also their fat and shells were used to make medicines combs and other things The number of Loggerheads today is small and so governments in many countries have laws that do not allow them to be hunted anymore

The main danger for Loggerheads now is the nets used by fishermen which can accidentally kill the turtles They are also killed by boats fishing hooks and other dangers from people

Today many organizations send people to find Loggerhead nests and protect the eggs They count many turtles come out of the eggs and take care of any that are sick These people do not try to help hatchlings that are not sick go to the ocean The exercise that the hatchlings get from walking to the sea is an important part of their development

The Islamic Golden Age also sometimes known as the Islamic Renaissance lasted from the 8th century to the 13th century Some scholars think one should count even the 15th and the 16th centuries to this period 

This period was called Golden Age because engineers scholars and traders in the Islamic world did much for the arts agriculture economics industry law literature navigation philosophy sciences and technology in this time They built upon earlier traditions and added inventions and innovations of their own Howard R Turner writes Muslim artists and scientists princes and laborers together created a unique culture that has directly and indirectly influenced societies on every continent

Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini was one of the greatest artists of the Italian Baroque period He was famous both for his sculpture and his architecture From 1527 he worked for Pope Urban XIII and then for Pope Alexander VII at St Peters Basilica where he designed the famous piazza in front of the basilica and many of the most splendid things that are inside 

Berninis life and work Bernini was born in Naples Italy He was the son of Pietro Bernini who was a well known sculptor When he was about 7 years old his father took him to Rome 

As a boy and as a young man living in Rome he saw the works of many famous artists He saw the famous fresco paintings on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel by Michelangelo one of the most famous artists of the 1500s The paintings told the Bible story of Creation He saw the huge dome of St Peters Basilica which Michelangelo designed and the new extension to the building that was being built by Carlo Maderna

One artist who Bernini knew well was Annibale Carracci who painted scenes on the ceilings of rooms for the pope The scenes told stories often Ancient Roman legends Carracci took Bernini into St Peters Basilica Bernini fell on his knees and decided at that moment that he wanted to make something beautiful and splendid to honour Saint Peter 

Another artist whose work Bernini saw was Caravaggio Caravaggios paintings were nothing like Carraccis Carraccis pictures were bright lively and colourful Caravaggios pictures were dark sad and often frightening But looking into Caravaggios paintings was like looking at something that was really happening while you were watching The people in Caravaggios paintings looked as if they could breathe speak and feel pain 

By the time he was 20 Bernini was a sculptor carving statues out of marble He had learnt a lot not just how to carve marble which he learnt from his father but how to make figures that told stories like Carraccis and Michelangelos and seemed to be alive like Caravaggios An important man in the Roman Catholic Church Cardinal Scipione Borghese saw his work and became his patron paying Bernini to make many beautiful sculptures for him and his family Soon the cardinals uncle got to hear about Bernini He was Pope Urban VIII the most powerful man in Italy He asked Bernini to work for him at St Peters Basilica Bernini spent 40 years of his life there all the time except for a trip to France and shorter visits to other cities

Berninis sculpture 

Most sculptures of that time were just of one figure But Bernini had seen Michelangelos famous sculpture of the Pieta which showed the Virgin Mary grieving over the body of her dead son Jesus Bernini made figures that were in groups and told stories One of his famous groups comes from Roman Mythology It shows the god Apollo chasing a beautiful wood nymph that he had fallen in love with But her father had magic powers and suddenly turned his daughter into a tree Bernini sculptured the very moment when her toes are turning into roots her legs are becoming the trunk and leaves are sprouting out of her hands and long hair She has her mouth open and a look of horror on her face No one had ever tried to carve anything like that in marble before The thing that is so amazing about Berninis sculpture is that he has made the flesh the wood the leaves and the hair all look so real even though they are all carved in white stone 

Berninis most famous sculpture is St Theresa in Ecstasy It tells the story of a saint who had a vision of an angel Her vision was so beautiful that she fainted Bernini has sculptured the vision with St Theresa lying on a cloud with the laughing angel in front of her Their robes are blowing around and it is hard to believe that the whole scene which is set against a wall is not really floating Bernini did not just design the statues He also designed the walls of the chapel around it which is like a stage set made of beautifully patterned marble Against another wall he carved a balcony and several white marble people looking at the scene They are members of the family that paid for the chapel 

The city of Rome has lots of squares with fountains in them Pope Alexander wanted to make the city more beautiful so during his time more fountains were made One of the biggest squares in Rome was the Piazza Navona On one side of the piazza was the church of St Agnes built by Borromini Bernini thought it was an ugly building He was asked to make the Fountain of the Rivers in the square right outside the church It has four figures who are symbols of four rivers Bernini carved one of river figures looking up at the church and throwing his hands in the air in shock at its ugliness Borromini was very upset with Berninis joke which has been there now for more than 300 years

Bernini at St Peters 

Berninis first work at St Peters was to design the baldacchino which is like a tent or pavilion above the High Altar This amazing thing is 30 metres tall and is probably the largest piece of bronze in the world It stands underneath Michelangelos dome and has four huge bronze twisted columns decorated with olive leaves and bees because bees were the symbol of Pope Urban Pope Urban had a niece that he loved very much and he got Bernini to put her face and the face of her new born baby boy on the columns as well

Holding up the dome of the Basilica were four enormous stone pillars Bernini had a great idea for the big piers He had four hollow niches carved into them where four huge statues could stand This sent some people into a panic because they thought the dome would fall down but it did not 

The basilica owns some precious relics a piece of the True Cross of Jesus a veil that a woman wiped the face of Jesus with while he was carrying the cross the spear that was used to pierce Jesus side and the bones of St Andrew the brother of St Peter No one knows for sure whether these things are real or not but for hundreds of years they have been precious Berninis plan was the make four marble statues of the four Holy people St Helena who found the cross St Longinus who was the soldier with the spear St Veronica who wiped Jesus face and St Andrew Even though the design is Berninis the statues which are all 5 metres high were made by four different sculptors Only St Longinus is the work of Bernini 

Berninis next job was to make a special throne out of bronze to hold an ancient wood and ivory throne that had been at the basilica for more than 500 years It is called the Cattedra Petri or throne of St Peter The bronze throne with the old wooden throne inside it is held up high at the end of the basilica by four important saints who are called Doctors of the Church because they were all great writers and teachers The statues are made of bronze They are Saints Ambrose and Augustine for the Church of Rome and Saints Athanasius and John Chrysostum for the Orthodox Church Above the chair is a window which is made not from glass but thin translucent stone called alabaster The Dove of the Holy Spirit is in the middle of the window with rays of light spreading out into the basilica through a sculpture of golden clouds and angels Bernini designed this to look like a window into Heaven There was a great celebration when the chair was put in place on January 16 1666 

St Peters Piazza To the west of the basilica is the Piazza di San Pietro The piazza was designed by Bernini and built between 1656 and 1667 It was not an easy job because the designer had lots of things to think about Firstly many people complained that Madernas facade on St Peters looked too wide so Bernini wanted to make it look narrower not wider Secondly in the old square left over from the Old St Peters Pope Sixtus V had a monument set up This monument was a precious Ancient Egyptian obelisk From its base to the top of the cross it was 40 metres high and had been brought to Roman in ancient times The obelisk really should be at the centre of the new square but it was not in quite the right place and was very difficult to move without breaking The third problem was that Maderna had built a fountain to one side of the obelisk and Bernini needed to make another fountain to match it otherwise the design would look unbalanced 

Bernini solved the problem by making two areas instead of one huge one The first area is an almost square area right in front of the facade It is cleverly designed with sloping sides that make the building look taller and not so wide The second part of the piazza is oval It has the obelisk at the centre with two fountains on either side at the widest part The two parts of the piazza are surrounded by a colonnade which is carried on tall columns All around are large statues of saints which seem to look down on the thousands of visitors that come to the square every day The colonnade is in two great arcs that seem to stretch out like loving arms welcoming people to the Basilica In recent times some buildings were demolished making another square to match the one near the piazza It is a good place for vans to park and can be seen in the photo

The famous architectural historian Sir Banister Fletcher said that no other city in the world had given such a wonderful view to people visiting their main church He said that no other architect except Bernini could have imagined such a noble design He said it is the greatest entrance to the greatest Christian church in the whole world

Berninis last work for St Peters 1676 was to decorate of the Chapel of the Sacrament He designed a miniature temple just like the one that was built over the place where St Peter died He made it bronze covered with fine gold On either side is an angel one gazing in adoration and the other looking towards the viewer in welcome Bernini died in 1680 aged 81 after working for St Peters for 40 years of his life

Marten Jacobszoon Heemskerck van Veen or Maarten van Heemskerck was one of the best known Dutch portrait and religious painters of the 16th century He became famous for a series of coloured prints of the Seven Wonders of the World 

Marten van Heemskerck was born in the town of Heemskerck near Haarlem in Holland His father was a farmer Marten was apprenticed to two painters in Haarlem but was called home by his father to help with the farm work Marten ran away from home and in a single day travelled 50 miles to the town of Delft He found another master to teach him painting but soon left him as well He then went to Haarlem where from 1527 29 he worked with a painter called Jan van Scorel 

One of the artists who influenced Marten van Heemskerck at this time was Jan Mabuse who had travelled to Italy and had seen the paintings of famous artists from Florence and Venice Marten began to copy the style of Mabuses paintings In 1532 he went to Italy and spent several years going from town to town looking at the artworks and making drawings of what he saw 

The city that was to have the most influence on Marten van Heemskerck was Rome He was very interested in the ruins left from the time of the Ancient Romans He made many drawings of the ruined buildings and other things that he saw His sketchbooks which are now in a museum in Berlin are very important evidence for showing what Rome was like in the 1500s One important building that he drew was St Peters Basilica which had been begun but never completed 

The most famous artist who was alive at this time was Michelangelo He was mainly a sculptor but he had spent five years painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel Like everybody else Marten van Heemskerck thought it was amazing He was so influenced by the figures that Michelangelo had painted that he designed a series of pictures called Twelve Panels showing Strong Men from Mythology and Biblical History Like the series of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World they are well known as prints made from engravings 

When van Heemskerck was in Rome in 1536 he got work as a scene painter This is like a person who paints the scenery in a theatre Charles V had coming to Rome and was going to have a triumphal procession The streets of the city were decorated with archways for the emperor to pass under Van Heemskerck worked with Antonio da San Gallo Battista Franco and Francesco Salviati The writer Giorgio Vasari saw some battle scenes that he painted and wrote that they were well composed and boldly painted

He returned to the Netherlands and lived at Haarlem where he settled down and married twice After that he only left Haarlem for a short time in 1572 to go to Amsterdam because the Spanish had invaded Haarlem In 1540 became president of his Guild of Painters He became a wealthy and well known painter When he died he left some money in his will to be paid to a bridal couple who would get married on his tomb This custom was believed to bring peace to the dead person He also left some land to help an orphanage in the city 

Many works by Marten van Heemskerck can still be seen They include Adam and Eve St Luke painting the Madonna and Child and a painting of Jesus in the museum in Ghent Belgium These pictures were done before he went to Italy In the 1550s he painted several altarpieces which can be seen in the museums of Delft Haarlem and Brussels as well as lives of St Bernard and St Benedict

Currywurst is often sold as a take outtake away food Schnell Imbisse at diners or greasy spoons on childrens menus in restaurants or as a street food

Berlin legend says that Herta Heuwer from Knigsberg invented the currywurst sauce by experimenting at her stall in Berlin Charlottenburg in 1949

People from the Ruhr area say that the sauce was accidentally invented by a sausage stall owner in Essen who dropped a can with curry powder into some ketchup 

Early in his career German pop singer Herbert Grnemeyer raised in Bochum wrote a song in the Ruhr dialect to currywurst

Although Berlin claims currywurst as its invention and national dish all over Germany there are more than 20 different types of currywurst

A nuclear power plant is a place where people make electricity using heat from nuclear reactions A nuclear power plant has a place where the nuclear reaction happens called a reactor The plant also has machines which remove heat from the reactor and make electricity Electricity made by nuclear power plants is called nuclear power 

Nuclear power plants are usually located near water to remove the heat the reactor makes Some nuclear power plants use cooling towers to do this Nuclear power plants use uranium as fuel When the reactor is on uranium atoms inside the reactor split into two smaller atoms When uranium atoms split they give off a large amount of heat This splitting of atoms is called fission 

The most popular atoms to fission are uranium and plutonium Uranium atoms are slightly radioactive The atoms produced when uranium breaks apart are strongly radioactive Today fission only happens in nuclear reactors In nuclear reactors fission only happens when the reactors parts are arranged properly Nuclear power plants turn their reactors off to replace old fuel with new fuel 

There are about four hundred nuclear power plants in the world with many in the United States France and Japan Some famous accidents at nuclear power plants were the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine and the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the United States

Mohamed Atta a member of terrorist organization al Qaeda and leader of the attacks and another hijacker Abdulaziz al Omari flew together from Portland Maine to Boston early on September 11 2001 Both hijackers had first class tickets for a flight to Los Angeles California Three other hijackers Waleed al Shehri Wail al Shehri and Satam al Suqami arrived at Logan International Airport by car All five checked in and by 0740 were aboard the aircraft which was supposed to leave at 0745 

Mohamed Atta sat in business class with Abdulaziz al Omari and Suqami Waleed al Shehri and Wail al Shehri sat in first class The aircraft taxied away from Gate 26 and departed Logan International Airport at 0759 from runway 4R after a 14 minute delay

It is thought that the highjacking of the plane started at 0814 This was when the pilot and first officer stopped talking with air traffic control at Boston Two minutes later the aircraft stopped flying along the route it was supposed to No more radio replies came from the aircraft and the system in the aircraft used to avoid collisions with other aircraft was also switched off Flight attendants Ong and Sweeney contacted American Airlines with ATT airphones during the hijack They said the hijackers had hurt two of the other attendants and killed an Israeli passenger During the long four minute call Ong told the airline which seats the hijackers were sitting in and said no one could get into the cockpit

At 082338 Atta tried to talk to the passengers from the cockpit but he pressed the wrong button and sent the message to air traffic control He said that They have some planes just stay quiet and youll be okay We are returning to the airport A minute later he said Nobody move Everything will be okay If you try to make any moves youll endanger yourself and the airplane Just stay quiet Air traffic control realized the aircraft had been hijacked and they called the Federal Aviation Administration Soon after Atta announced Nobody move please we are going back to the airport dont try to make any stupid moves Five minutes later Boston Air Traffic Control called North American Aerospace Defense Command NORAD ordered two F 15 fighter aircraft to catch the flight but it was too lateAA 11 had already made its last turn towards Manhattan and crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center more than six minutes before the fighter aircraft had taken off

At 084640 the hijackers crashed Flight 11 into the northern side of the North Tower of the World Trade Center The aircraft traveling at about convert466mphkmh0lkonsingoff and carrying about 10000 US gallons of flammable fuel hit between the 93rd and 99th floors of the North Tower In all 92 people on board were killed

Because the North Tower was so damaged people could not escape from above where the aircraft had crashed All stairs and elevators from the 92nd floor and up were blocked trapping 1344 people Hundreds were killed right away by the impact The rest either were trapped and died from the fire and smoke or the collapse of the tower Some died after they jumped from the building More than one elevator shaft carried burning fuel downward exploding on the way down

Jules Naudet a French cameraman filmed the crash A webcam set up at an art broken wikt linkexhibitionexhibition in Brooklyn to take pictures of Lower Manhattan every four seconds also filmed Flight 11 crashing into the North Tower

News organizations first reported an explosion at the World Trade Center CNN interrupted a commercial at 0849 with the headline that read World Trade Center Disaster President George W Bush was arriving at an elementary school in Sarasota Florida when he was told about the crash The president said This is pilot error Its unbelievable that somebody would do this The guy must have had a heart attack The first news reports believed that the crash had been an accident until Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower at 0903

After the crash the North Tower burned and collapsed Although the crash caused much damage the fire caused by jet fuel was blamed for the damage and collapse of the tower Hundreds of rescue workers also died when the tower collapsed 

Rescue workers at the site started to find remains of bodies from the victims of Flight 11 soon after the attack Some workers found bodies strapped to airplane seats Other workers discovered the body of a flight attendant with her hands tied up That meant that the hijackers may have used handcuffs Within a year remains of the 33 victims that had been on Flight 11 had been identified They identified two other Flight 11 victims lead flight attendant Karen Martin and another person after body remains were discovered near Ground Zero in 2006 In April 2007 examiners using newer DNA technology identified another Flight 11 victim The remains of two hijackers who could have been from Flight 11 were also identified and removed from Memorial Park in Manhattan The remains of the other hijackers have not been identified and are buried with other unidentified remains at Memorial Park

In a video recording found months later in Afghanistan al Qaedas leader Osama bin Laden seemed to say he planned the attack He said he believed part of towers would collapse The flight recorders or tapes that record useful flight data for Flight 11 and Flight 175 were never found

After the attacks the flight number for flights on the same route at the same takeoff time was changed to American Airlines Flight 25 and a Boeing 757 was used instead of a Boeing 767 An American flag was flown on the jet bridge from which Flight 11 departed from Logan Airport

A shoulder rest is something which is used by people who play the violin or the viola It may be made of wood aluminium carbon fiber or plastic Usually the shoulder rest attaches to the edge of the violin with feet padded with rubber tubing or made of soft plastic

The purpose of a shoulder rest is to help the player to be comfortable holding the violin which is held between the chin and the shoulder Not all players use a shoulder rest Many violinists prefer just to put a piece of cloth or some other form of padding on their shoulder Whether a player uses a shoulder rest may depend on whether he or she has a long neck and whether he is wearing clothes made with thick or thin material It is important that the player can shift his left hand easily and freely to play in the higher positions without being afraid that he will drop the instrument and without feeling the need to squeeze the instrument between his chin and shoulder as this will make the muscles in his neck very tight

The shoulder rest must not be confused with the chinrest which is the bit on which the player rests his chin

Certain category groups have special uses or requirements

Categories that are based on geography and nationality all use the same basic structure Nationality categories are sub categories of their associated geography categories as well as what ever other categories apply CatEnglish people is also a Catpeopleno based category so it is a sub category of CatBritish people

The top level of each category is based on the continent it is a part of The next level would be Country Each country is seperatd into the major sub division of that country and then smaller subdivisions This is repeated down until the municipality level is reached 

Categories are only seperated down to the point there is enough articles to need it The municipality level is usually only needed for the largest of cities In some cases steps between categories can be skipped For example in most countries the city category is a part of the country category because there is not enough need for the steps in between 

A sample of commonly seen country sub divisions is seen below 

The United Kingdom is a special case It includes the countries of England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland as well as many other areas Many of these areas do not have their own categories Another problem is that if something is termed British it may not be possible to know if it is actually one of the countries which make up the United Kingdom If the actual country is known it should be used If it is not known the BritishUnited Kingdom level should be used 

The catMusical entertainers is used to group all entertainers who deal with music

The main category includes sub categories for singers songwriters musicians bands composers and conductors The category is broken down into each of these major groups as well as catMusical entertainers by nationality

The secondary levels are mainly broken down into a combination of nationality and occupation Examples of this are catEnglish singers and catGerman musicians The categories use the same basic set up for nationality as the Geography categories

Many topics have types of categories which usually apply to every article in the topic For example Movies should all have a category for the year they were released the genre of the movie and its country of origin 

Some of these topics include

The camera obscura was an optical device that helped the invention of photography In English todays photographic devices are still known as cameras

The principle of the camera obscura can be demonstrated with a rudimentary type just a box with a hole in one side Light from only one part of a scene will pass through the hole and strike a specific part of the back wall 

With this simple do it yourself apparatus the image is always upside down By using mirrors as in the 18th century overhead version it is also possible to project an up side up image As a pinhole is made smaller the image gets sharper but the light sensitivity decreases 

The first mention and discovery of the principles behind the pinhole camera a precursor to the camera obscura belong to Mozi a Chinese philosopher and founder of Mohism Later Aristotle understood the optical principle of the pinhole camera He viewed the crescent shape of a partially eclipsed sun projected on the ground through the holes in a sieve and the gaps between leaves of a plane tree

The first camera obscura was later built by an Iraqi scientist named Abu Ali Al Hasan Ibn al Haytham born in Basra known in the West as Alhacen or Alhazen who carried out practical experiments on optics in his Book of Optics In his various experiments Ibn Al Haitham used the term Al Bayt al Muthlim translated in English as dark room In the experiment he undertook in order to establish that light travels in time and with speed he says If the hole was covered with a curtain and the curtain was taken off the light traveling from the hole to the opposite wall will consume time He reiterated the same experience when he established that light travels in straight lines The most revealing experiment which indeed introduced the camera obscura was in his studies of the half moon shape of the suns image during eclipses which he observed on the wall opposite a small hole made in the window shutters In his famous essay On the form of the Eclipse he commented on his observation The image of the sun at the time of the eclipse unless it is total demonstrates that when its light passes through a narrow round hole and is cast on a plane opposite to the hole it takes on the form of a moon sickle 

In his experiment of the sun light he extended his observation of the penetration of light through the pinhole to conclude that when the sun light reaches and penetrates the hole it makes a conic shape at the points meeting at the pinhole forming later another conic shape reverse to the first one on the opposite wall in the dark room This happens when sun light diverges from point until it reaches an aperture and is projected through it onto a screen at the luminous spot  Since the distance between the aperture and the screen is insignificant in comparison to the distance between the aperture and the sun the divergence of sunlight after going through the aperture should be insignificant In other words should be about equal to  However it is observed to be much greater when the paths of the rays which form the extremities of are retraced in the reverse direction it is found that they meet at a point outside the aperture and then diverge again toward the sun as illustrated in figure 1  This was indeed the first accurate description of the Camera Obscura phenomenon 

In camera terms the light converges into the room through the hole transmitting with it the object facing it  The object will appear in full colour but upside down on the projecting screenwall opposite the hole inside the dark room The explanation is that light travels in a straight line and when some of the rays reflected from a bright subject pass through the small hole in thin material they do not scatter but cross and reform as an upside down image on a flat white surface held parallel to the hole Ib Al Haitham established that the smaller the hole is the clearer the picture is

Although both the pinhole camera and camera obscura is credited to Ibn al Haytham the camera obscura was first described by Aristotle who was the first to describe how an image is formed on the eye using the camera obscura as an analogy Alhazen states and with respect to the camera obscura Et nos non inventimus ita we did not invent this

Some camera obscura have been built as tourist attractions often taking the form of a large chamber within a high building that can be darkened so that a live panorama of the world outside is projected onto a horizontal surface through a rotating lens Although few now survive examples can be found at the following locations

There is also a portable example which Willett Patteson tour around England and the world

Camera obscura means darkened chamber to describe early devices for projecting an image on a screen by use of a lens or a pinhole

Camera obscura can also mean

A pinhole camera is a camera without a conventional glass lens An extremely small hole in a very thin material can focus light when all rays from a scene go through a single point In order to produce a reasonably clear image the aperture has to be about 1100th the distance to the screen or less The shutter of a pinhole camera usually consists of a hand operated flap of some light proof material to cover and uncover the pinhole 

A common use of a pinhole camera is to capture the movement of sunlight over a long period of time This type of photography is called Solargraphy Pinhole cameras require much longer exposure times than conventional cameras because of the small aperture typical exposure times can range from 5 seconds to hours or days 

The image may be projected on a translucent screen for real time viewing 

 Invention of pinhole camera  Very early in history Greeks such as Aristotle and Euclid wrote on naturally occurring rudimentary pinhole cameras for example light may travel through the slits of wicker baskets and the crossing of leaves The ancient Greeks however believed that our eye emitted rays which enabled us to see What enabled a much better understanding of the pinhole camera was the discovery that light enters the eye rather than leaving it It was the 10th century Muslim mathematician astronomer and physicist Ibn al Haytham who published this idea 

Shutter could mean

In photography a shutter is the part of a camera that opens for a controlled period of time to let light in during taking a picture

A shutter can also be used to allow pulses of light to pass outwards as in a movie projector or signal lamp

Camera shutters can be fitted in two positions

Shutters immediately behind the lens were used in some cameras with limited lens interchangeability Shutters in front of the lens were used in the early days of photography

A movie projector is a machine that shows moving pictures by projecting them on a projection screen Most of the optical and mechanical elements except for the illumination and sound devices are present in movie cameras

The Doctor is the central character in the long running BBC science fiction television series Doctor Who 

He is an alien a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey The Doctor travels in his space time ship the TARDIS with which he can go anywhere in time and space Because the TARDIS chameleon circuit is broken it looks like an old British police box permanently The Doctor often takes other people with him who are usually called companions or assistants They are most often human the most recent companion is Amy Pond 

The Doctor did not want to stay on Gallifrey any longer so he borrowed an old Type 40 TARDIS In the TARDIS he and his granddaughter Susan Foreman left their home planet Gallifrey They stayed for a time on Earth in the 1960s where Susan also went to school Her teachers Barbara Wright and Ian Chesterton discovered the TARDIS They traveled for a while with the Doctor and returned to Earth two years later After them the Doctor often took other people with him on his travels

As a Gallifreyan the Doctor looks like a human on the surface but there are differences One well known difference is that he has two hearts As a Time Lord the Doctor can also regenerate if his body is badly hurt and he dies During the regeneration the body is healed and renewed which includes a different appearance and personality The regenerated person is the same person with the same memories and basic personality traits but the person also looks different and a changed personality Because of this the Doctor could be played by different actors This made it possible for the series to be filmed over a time of nearly fifty years without having to actually change the character

The Doctor has been played by other actors in other media in theatre plays parodies etc But these are not officially part of the Doctor Who storyline Notable among them are

WWE RAW is the Monday night professional wrestling television program for World Wrestling Entertainment and is the main broadcast of the Raw brand WWE Raw is usually seen as WWEs flagship program over its sister programs SmackDown and NXT due to its longer history and the way it is promoted

Starting as WWF Monday Night Raw the program first started on January 11 1993 on the USA Network for one hour The original Raw broke new ground in televised professional wrestling Traditionally wrestling shows were taped on sound stages with small viewers or at big arena shows The Raw formula was very different than that of its predecessor Prime Time Wrestling Instead of taped matches with studio voice overs and taped chat Raw was a show shot to a live viewers with angles as they happened The first episode had Yokozuna winning against Koko B Ware The Steiner Brothers winning against The Executioners WWF Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels winning against Max Moon and The Undertaker winning against Damien Demento The show also featured an interview with Razor Ramon

Raw came from the Grand Ballroom at Manhattan Center Studios a small New York City theater and played live each week The combination of an intimate venue and live action proved highly successful However the weekly live schedule proved to be a financial drain on the WWF and taped shows began airing every other week From early 1994 to September 1999 Raw was shown live on one Monday and then the next day next Mondays Raw was taped This meant that Raw was live one week and taped the next 

The storylines and characters during the early years of Raw still had a healthy dose of the old Federation gimmick heavy style For example there were moments such as Irwin R Schyster tearing up Tatankas headdress the different Undertaker sightings and characters like Duke The Dumpster Droese Doink the Clown or Thurman Sparky Plugg

Raw was also one of a kind in which they covered the unexpected exciting moments a prelude to the Attitude Era in which it coined Raw as Uncut Uncensored Uncooked Some of those moments are Razor Ramon losing a match unexpectedly to Sean The 1 2 3 Kid Waltman who was later known as X Pac Marty Jannetty beating Shawn Michaels to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship and Raw was the first WWF television program of any kind to show footage of Lex Luger bodyslamming Yokozuna at the USS Intrepid

The first hosts of Raw were Vince McMahon Rob Bartlett and Macho Man Randy Savage Sean Mooney conducted the interviews and Bobby The Brain Heenan also helped contribute In March 1993 Rob Bartlett was dropped from the broadcasting team and was replaced by Bobby Heenan Then on December 6 1993 Gorilla Monsoon kicked Bobby Heenan out of the WWF forever In reality this was a storyline between Monsoon and his close friend Heenan who decided to leave the World Wrestling Federation in order to lighten his travel schedule and because he did not want to take a 50 paycut After about a year Raw moved out of the Manhattan Center and traveled to various regular Federation venues in the United StatesFactdateDecember 2007

In 1995 World Championship Wrestling began showing its new wrestling show Monday Nitro live each week on TNT Raw and Nitro went head to head for the first time on September 11 1995 Due to Raws taping schedule on several occasions WCW Vice President Eric Bischoff who was also an on air personality would often give away the results of WWFs taped Raw shows on the live WCW show Some fans also looked at Raw taping results on the steadily growing Internet as a result this caused the ratings of the taped Raw episodes to be lower

WWF Raw had a live broadcast every other week to save costs until September 1999 when ratings and pay per view buy rate grown allowing them to justify doing a weekly live show

At the start of the ratings war in 1995 through to mid 1996 Raw and Nitro exchanged victories over each over in a closely contested rivalry Beginning in mid 1996 however thanks primarily to the nWo angle Monday Nitro started a ratings win streak that lasted for eighty three continuous weeks ending on April 13 1998FactdateDecember 2007

On February 3 1997 Monday Night Raw went to a two hour format as the Attitude Era was starting to come in full stream in the WWF In an attempt to break the momentum of what had turned into ratings domination by WCWs competing Monday Nitro Extreme Championship Wrestling was brought in as Jerry Lawler challenged ECW on February 17 1997 In an episode where Raw returned to the Manhattan Center the challenge answered on the following weeks show with Taz Mikey Whipwreck Sabu Tommy Dreamer D Von Dudley and the Sandman ECW owner Paul Heyman did a call in interview on Raw the week after that

During 1997 there were more and more controversial elements in Raw and WWF programming such as the Nation of Domination and the D Generation X racial graffiti storyline designed to implicate Bret Harts the Hart Foundation and the XXX Files series

On March 10 1997 Monday Night Raw officially became Raw is War The March 17 1997 episode featured a heated Bret HartVince McMahon ringside altercation with profanity normally unheard on TV Brian Pillman did a series of XXX Files segments with Terri Runnels which further pushed the envelope These segments ended prematurely with the September 29 1997 episode of Raw after the death of Pillman on October 5 1997 due to hereditary heart problems

After WrestleMania XIV in March 1998 the WWF regained the lead in the Monday Night Wars with its new WWF Attitude brand led in particular by rising stars Steve Austin The Rock and Mankind The classic feud between the villainous WWF Chairman Vince McMahon and fan favorite Steve Austin caught the imaginations of fans The April 13 1998 episode of Raw headlined by a match between Austin and McMahon marked the first time that WCW had lost the head to head Monday night ratings battle in the 84 weeks since 1996

While Raw was taking a new approach to programming Nitro would start making lackluster shows with the same storylines Older stars such as Hogan and Nash frequented the main events while younger talent such as Chris Jericho Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero were not given opportunities to advance and the only newcomer elevated to main event status at this time was Bill Goldberg

Meanwhile on Raw fans were immersed in the feud between WWF owner Vince McMahon and Stone Cold Steve Austin New talent such as Triple H and his D Generation X faction Mankind and The Rock were elevated to main event status on the WWFs program Superstars such as Kane Val Venis Goldust etc were coming through the ranks and exposing the WWF as the place where new talent comes through unlike the WCW counterpart Things were so heated between the two programs that when both shows were in the same area on the same night D X was sent to film a war segment at the Norfolk Scope where they berated WCW and interviewed fans on camera who stated that they received their Nitro tickets for free

On January 4 1999 Mick Foley who had wrestled for WCW in the early 1990s as Cactus Jack won the WWF Title as Mankind on Raw On orders from Bischoff Nitro announcer Tony Schiavone gave away this previously taped result on the live Nitro and then sarcastically added thatll sure put some butts in the seats over 600000 viewers changed channels to watch Raw This was also the night that Nitro aired a WCW World Championship match in which Kevin Nash blatantly laid down for Hulk Hogan after Hogan poked him in the chest The next week and for months after many fans in the Raw audience brought signs which read Mick Foley put my ass in this seat

A new television contract with Viacom led to a WWF change in the broadcast On September 25 2000 Raw moved from the USA Network to TNN

WCWs sharp decrease in revenue and ratings led to Time Warners sale of the company to the WWF in 2001 The last version of Nitro was shown on March 26 2001 The show began with Vince McMahon making a short statement about his recent purchase of WCW and ended with a simulcast on Raw on TNN with an appearance by Vinces son Shane McMahon on Nitro Shane interrupted his fathers gloating over the WCW purchase to explain that Shane was the one who actually owned WCW setting up what become the WWFs Invasion storyline

The Raw is War logo and name were retired in September 2001 following the September 11 2001 attacks and sensitivity over the word war It also symbolized that professional wrestlings Monday Night Wars were overFactdateDecember 2007

In early to mid 2002 WWE had a process they called the Brand Extension WWE divided itself into two de facto wrestling promotions with separate rosters storylines and authority figures Raw and SmackDown would host each division give its name to the division and essentially compete against each other The split was a result of WWF purchasing their two biggest competitors WCW and ECW The brand extension was publicly announced during a telecast of WWF Raw on March 25 2002 and became official the next day

Wrestlers now would become show exclusive wrestling for their specific show only At the time this excluded the WWE Undisputed Championship and WWE Womens Championship as those WWE titles would be defended on both shows In August 2002 WWE Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar did not want to defend the title on Raw in effect causing his title to become exclusive to SmackDown The following week on Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff awarded a newly instated World Heavyweight Championship to Raws designated 1 contender Triple H Due to the fact that since the WWE Undisputed Championship was now SmackDown exclusive it was no longer seen as undisputed Following this the WWE Womens Championship soon became Raw exclusive as well As a result of the Brand Extension an annual draft lottery was instituted to exchange members of each roster and generally refresh the lineups 

WWE Raw said they have earned the distinction of having the most original episodes of any fictional weekly program on August 2 2005 when it broadcast the 636th episode It was said to have took the place of Gunsmoke which held that distinction However under the criteria WWE used to make this claim the actual record would be held by the show Georgia Championship Wrestling which ran continuously on Saturday evenings on TBS between 1972 and 1984FactdateDecember 2007

On March 10 2005 Viacom and WWE decided not to go on with the agreement with Spike TV making it so Raw and other WWE programs on the network would cease when their deal expired in September 2005 On April 4 2005 WWE announced a 3 year deal with NBC Universal to bring Raw back to its old home the USA Network with 2 yearly specials on NBC and a Spanish Raw on Telemundo On the same week as Raws restart on USA Spike TV scheduled Ultimate Fighting Championships live Ultimate Fight Night in Raws old timeslot in a try to go head to head with Raw

The following week Vince McMahon fired Jim Ross for not helping after Steve Austin gave him and his entire family the Stone Cold Stunner Jonathan Coachman the second analyst at the table took over Rosss duties as play by play for two weeks until former ECW announcer Joey Styles was hired

On the May 1 2006 version of Raw Joey Styles said he was quitting His vacating of the announcer position set the stage for Jim Ross to return to Raws commentary booth thus ending the storyline where Ross got fired by Linda McMahon This freed Styles to become a commentator for the ECW brand when it launched in June

In Canada after an 11 year run on TSN Raw moved to rival sports broadcaster The Score after it was announced that TSN would be carrying Monday Night Football for the 2006 season This also meant that Canadian viewers would be watching via tape delay as The Score did not broadcast Raw live at first but in 2007 started airing the show liveFactdateJanuary 2008

Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein was an Austrian philosopher He worked mainly in the basics of logic the philosophy of mathematics the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of language He is regarded as one of the most important philosophers of the twentieth century 

Before his death at the age of 62 the only book Wittgenstein had published was the Tractatus Logico Philosophicus His second book Philosophical Investigations was published shortly after he died Both of these works are regarded as very important for analytic philosophy

Ludwig Wittgenstein was born in Vienna on April 26 1889 to Karl and Leopoldine Wittgenstein He was the youngest of eight children and was born into one of the most prominent and wealthy families in the Austro Hungarian empire His fathers parents Hermann Christian and Fanny Wittgenstein were born into Jewish families but later converted to Protestantism and after they moved from Saxony to Vienna in the 1850s assimilated themselves into the Viennese Protestant professional classes Ludwigs father Karl Wittgenstein became an industrialist and went on to make a fortune in iron and steel Ludwigs mother Leopoldine born Kalmus was an aunt of the Nobel Prize laureate Friedrich von Hayek Despite Karls Protestantism and the fact that Leopoldines father was Jewish the Wittgenstein children were baptized as Roman Catholics the faith of their maternal grandmother and Ludwig was given a Roman Catholic burial upon his death

Wittgenstein began studying mechanical engineering During his research he became interested in the foundations of mathematics particularly after reading Bertrand Russells Principles of Mathematics and Gottlob Freges Grundgesetze In 1911 Wittgenstein visited Frege and Russell and discussed philosophy with them at great length He made a great impression on Russell and started to work on the foundations of logic and mathematical logic Russell saw Wittgenstein as a successor who would carry on his work 

During the First World War Wittgenstein served in the army and developed his logic He included ethical aspects In the summer of 1918 he learned that his friend David Pinsent had been killed in an airplane accident Wittgenstein became depressed and thought of suicide He went to stay with his uncle Paul where he was able to complete the Tractatus No publisher accepted it but Russell realised it was a philosophically important work and wrote an introduction Wittgenstein did not like it because he thought that Russel had not understood the book In the end Wilhelm Ostwalds journal Annalen der Naturphilosophie printed a German edition in 1921 and Routledges Kegan Paul printed a bilingual edition with Russells introduction in 1922

Since Wittgenstein thought that the Tractatus had solved all the problems of philosophy he left philosophy and returned to Austria to train as a primary school teacher Wittgenstein had unrealistic expectations of the rural children he taught and had little patience with those children who had no gift for mathematics But he had good results with children that were interested especially boys His severe disciplinary methods led to disagreement with some of his students parents and eventually he resigned his position and returned to Vienna feeling that he had failed as a school teacher

After abandoning his work as a school teacher Wittgenstein worked as a gardeners assistant in a monastery near Vienna and then he worked with the architect Paul Engelmann This intellectual work did much to restore Wittgensteins spirits

Toward the end of this work Wittgenstein was contacted by Moritz Schlick one of the leading figures of the newly formed Vienna Circle This contact stimulated Wittgenstein intellectually and revived his interest in philosophy 

In 1929 he decided to return to Cambridge He was met at the railway station by a crowd of Englands greatest intellectuals He found out to his horror that he was one of the most famous philosophers in the world now In 1939 Wittgenstein was appointed to the chair in Philosophy at Cambridge 

During World War II he left Cambridge and volunteered as a hospital porter in Guys Hospital in London and as a laboratory assistant in Newcastle upon Tynes Royal Victoria Infirmary 

Wittgenstein resigned his position at Cambridge in 1947 to concentrate on his writing When in 1949 one found out that he had prostate cancer he had written most of the material that would be published after his death from the disease as Philosophische Untersuchungen which might be his most important work

Tsing Hua University or THU is a university in Beijing Peoples Republic of China It is regarded as one of the best and most selective universities in China It was established in 1911 as a school for Chinese graduates wanting to go further with their studies at universities in other countries especially America and the UK

Tsing Hua University was opened in Beijing China in 1911 on the site of a former royal garden belonging to a prince It was first a preparatory school a school for preparation for students to be later sent by the government to study in America The people who graduated were transferred directly to American schools as juniors upon graduation

In 1925 the school established its College Department and started its research institute on Chinese Study In 1928 the name officially changed to National Tsing Hua University

During the Second World War in 1937 Tsing Hua University along with Peking University and Nankai University merged to form Chang Sha Temporary University in Chang Sha which later became National Southwestern Associated University in Kunming of Yunnan province After the war Tsing Hua moved back to Beijing and resumed its operation

The communist victory at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 led to the creation of the Peoples Republic of China so the universitys President Mei Yi Qi and some professors went to Taiwan where they established the National Tsing Hua Institute of Nuclear Technology in 1955 which later became National Tsing Hua University

In 1952 the communist government regrouped the countrys higher education institutions in an attempt to build a Soviet style system with individual institutions tending to specialise in a certain field of study TsingHua University was disassembled losing its law school school of agriculture school of sciences and humanities and became a polytechnic engineering university Even so the University remained in the top tier schools in China In many years following this regroup the school was often referred to as the MIT of China But since the 1980s the university began to incorporate a multidisciplinary system As a result a lot of schools were built and rebuilt These included the School of Science School of Economics and Management School of Humanities and Social Sciences School of Law School of Public Administration and the School of Art Only two colleges charge tuition to its graduate students the law school and the Academy of Arts and Design

During the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976 the university became a battlefield between different sects of Maos Red Guards and a stronghold of the radicals It did not resume its normal operation until 1977 when the Cultural Revolution was officially put to an end 

Since 1977 the university has enjoyed rich government funding and policy support which greatly improved its facilities Since 1978 it has flourished with the re establishment of the departments in sciences economics and management and the humanities Its graduate school has been recognized nationally ranking first in the National Evaluation of Graduate Schools The School of Continuing Education makes the best use of modern information technologiesFactdateJuly 2007 as well as the advanced educational resources at Tsing Hua

Most Chinese university rankings place TsingHua first in China It attracts the most talented students of the nation and enjoys the best engineering and applied sciences programs in China occupying a position similar to MIT Stanford and Princeton in the US Peking Union Medical College of Tsinghua University is likewise regarded as the best medical school in the country Tsinghuas longtime rival Peking University is better known for natural sciences social sciences law and liberal arts somewhat similar to the Ivy League schools of Yale Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania

Admission to Tsinghua is highly competitive The majority of selected students are national scholars and among the brightest high school graduates in the country Many of Chinas top scientists engineers politicians and business leaders are among Tsinghua alumni The current Chinese president Hu Jintao is a former Tsinghua student who graduated with a degree in hydraulic engineering in 1964 

There are voices of criticism that nowadays the universitys top graduates are more likely to enroll at prestigious US university and research institutionsFactdateJuly 2007

As of 2003 Tsinghua University had 12 colleges and 48 departments 41 research institutes 35 research centers and 167 laboratories including 15 national key laboratories In September 2006 Peking Union Medical College was renamed to Peking Union Medical College Tsinghua University The university offers 51 bachelors degree programs 139 masters degree programs and 107 PhD programs Recently Tsinghua has become the first Chinese university to offer a Master of Laws program in American law through a cooperative venture with the Temple University Beasley School of Law The university is a member of LAOTSE an international network of leading universities in Europe and Asia Each year the University celebrates the Intellectual Property Summer Institute in cooperation with Franklin Pierce Law Center of Concord New Hampshire

A subsurface structuremap is a type of subsurface map whose contours represent the elevation of a particular formation reservoir or geologic marker in space such that folds faults and other geologic structures are clearly displayed Its appearance is similar to that of a topographic map but a topographic map displays elevations of the Earths surface and a structure map displays the elevation of a particular rock layer generally beneath the surface

Cave paintings are paintings on cave walls and ceilings Usually these paintings were made in Prehistoric times Most cave paintings date from 10000 to 20000 years ago The oldest are from about 32000 years ago but scientists still disagree if this dating is correct

It is not known why these paintings were made Most people think they may have had a function for rituals They may also have been a way to transit information to tell other people about something Most paintings are in caves that are difficult to access These caves usually also do not show signs that people lived there all year round 

Today there are about 350 caves known which have paintings in them A great number is located in France and Spain The best known are probably the caves of Altamira Lascaux or Creswell Crags in England Sometimes paintings were also done on cliff faces Fewer of those have survived though because of erosion One such example are the rock paintings of Astuvansalmi

Most often animals or hunting scenes were painted Sometimes hands are there too Rarely there are also more abstract patterns these are usually called finger fluntings

The paintings were drawn with red and yellow ochre hematite manganese oxide and charcoal Sometimes the silhouette of the animal was put into the rock first

Radiocarbon dating also known as the C14 method is a way of telling how old something is It is a type of radiometric dating The method uses the radioactive isotope carbon 14 Most organic matter contains carbon Carbon has different isotopes which are usually not radioactive 14C is the radioactive one its half life or time it takes to radioactively decay to one half its original amount is about 5730 years This makes it possible to tell the age of substances that contain carbon The method works to about 60000 years old Dates obtained are usually written as before present 

Plants take up atmospheric carbon dioxide by photosynthesis and are ingested by animals so every living thing is constantly exchanging carbon 14 with its environment as long as it lives Once it dies however this exchange stops

In 1958 Hessel de Vries showed that the concentration of carbon 14 in the atmosphere varies with time and locality The relatively short lived 14C is constantly renewed by cosmic ray bombardment on atmospheric nitrogen Since the bombardment is slightly variable and for other reasons the 14C taken into organic matter is also slightly variable That leads to slight errors in the chronology However under about 20000 years the results can be compared with dendrochronology based on tree rings For the most accurate work variations are compensated by means of calibration curves 

The method was developed by Willard Libby and his colleagues at the University of Chicago in 1949 In 1960 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work He first demonstrated the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by accurately estimating the age of wood from an ancient Egyptian royal barge of which the age was known from historical documents

A Passage tomb or passage grave is a tomb which can be reached through a passage Most of these tombs were constructed during prehistoric times Most often large stones called Megaliths were used to construct them These kinds of tombs can be found in large numbers in Ireland and Scotland 

The Hallstatt era is named after the city Hallstatt in Austria where the first artifacts were found It lasted from about 1200 BC to about 275 BC There were different periods which today are mainly told apart by the kinds of brooches used These brooches changed rather rapidly and permit a good estimate Hallstatt culture sites have been found in the east of France in Switzerland in the south of Germany in Austria in Slovenia and Croatia northwestern Hungary southwestern Slovakia and southern Moravia

In this time the social structure developed into a hierarchy This can be documented by various things that were added to gaves for example at Magdalenenberg In the Bronze Age people used to live in big settlements As iron became available trade routes changed A new upper class could establish itself Unlike before these upper class people liked to live in big houses in the countryside as a demonstration of their power Funerary cults also changed from cremation burials to burials with broken wikt linksarcophagussarcophagi The new upper class used their wealth for import goods mostly from the Mediterranean

The La Tne culture is a culture that lasted from about 500 BC to about 100 AD It is named after the city of La Tne It was influenced a lot by the Roman and Greek cultures There are two sources for this

The Celts basically lived in clans These were led by leaders the Druids and Bards Women were much better off than with the Romans they were factually equal to men There was Polygyny and Polyandry

A Ring fort is a fortified settlement Ring forts were made to protect villages mostly in the Middle Ages In Ireland where many such forts can be found they are also known as rth caiseal cathair and dn in the early Irish sources

Beowulf is an Old English heroic epic poem It is not known who wrote it but it was originally written down between the 8th and the 11th century The only copy of Beowulf that still exists is from about 1010 Beowulf is 3183 lines long 

The protagonist of the poem is Beowulf The poem is named after him In the poem Beowulf fights three monsters Grendel and Grendels mother and later in his life an unnamed dragon 

Hrothgar a Danish king has built a big mead hall which is called Heorot Hrothgar and his people live a good life and celebrate in Heorot But then they are attacked by Grendel who comes to Heorot every night and kills some of Hrothgars people

Beowulf is a Geatic warrior from Geatland He hears of Hrothgars troubles with Grendel Beowulf and his men leave Geatland to help King Hrothgar

Beowulf and his men stay the night in Heorot When Grendel comes to kill them Beowulf fights him Beowulf tears Grendels arm off from his body and sticks it on the wall as a trophy Grendel runs to his home in the marshes where he dies Everyone is happy that Grendel is killed and celebrates But the next night Grendels mother comes to Heorot and kills many people for revenge and grabs Grendels arm Beowulf then goes to the marshes where Grendel and his mother lived Beowulf fights Grendels mother and kills her

Beowulf later becomes a king He fights a dragon that was living in a barrow With the help of the young man Wiglaf Beowulf kills the dragon But Beowulf is wounded in the final battle and dies

The story of Beowulf has often been told in books plays and films Sometimes the full story is told sometimes just parts of the story Sometimes the plot is altered Sometimes only ideas or themes are taken from the story Some examples are

The White Guardian assigns Romana to help the Doctor during his quest for the Key to Time Romana first appears in The Ribos Operation and was intended as a contrast to her predecessor the savage Leela Romana is initially haughty and somewhat arrogant looking down on the Doctor and responding to his initial resentment at her presence with icy put downs However she soon gains an appreciation for the Doctors experience and sense of adventure and begins to respect him as a teacher

The introduction of Romanas second incarnation in Destiny of the Daleks a script credited to Terry Nation but with several changes by script editor Douglas Adams treats the concept of regeneration humorously At the beginning of the serial Romana changes bodily forms several times like she was trying on different outfits before deciding to take the form of Princess Astra who had been played by Lalla Ward in the final serial of Season 16 The Armageddon Factor 

Romana II enjoys a more intimate relationship with the Doctor than her first incarnation some fans have assumed that she had a romantic relationship with the Doctor Although a relationship was never shown or intended by the writers In many ways she is the companion most like her Doctor  besides being of the same race and close to the same intelligence she occasionally mimics his sense of style wields her own sonic screwdriver and can occasionally get the better of him in moments of banter and more practical situations As her practical experience develops she also becomes more assured and capable in the situations she finds herself in

Her final television appearance was in Warriors Gate where along with the robot dog K 9 she leaves to forge her own path in the parallel universe of E space She also appears briefly in the 20th Anniversary special The Five Doctors through the reuse of footage from the uncompleted story Shada because Tom Baker refused to come back

After the departure of both Romana I and II both versions of the character also appeared very briefly in flashback sequences during the Fourth Doctors regeneration in Logopolis as well as the Fifth Doctors mind copy in Resurrection of the Daleks

She would also be mentioned in Castrovalva during the Fifth Doctors post regenerative confusion as well as Arc of Infinity where the Fifth Doctor in response to a reprimand from the High Council of Time Lords for leaving her behind retorts that she chose to remain in E Space 

In the new series the doctor says that all of the Time Lords apart from him were killed in the time war Whether Romana was killed with the others or is still alive in E Space or elsewhere has not been specifically established on screen

An article by Russell T Davies in the Doctor Who Annual 2006 states that Romana was President of the Time Lords during the Time War against the Daleks which ended with Gallifrey being destroyed As with all spin off media and the new series it is unknown if it is canon

In the licensed Virgin New Adventures novel Blood Harvest by Terrance Dicks Romana II leaves E Space and returns to Gallifrey with the help of the Seventh Doctor In Goth Opera by Paul Cornell from the complementary Missing Adventures series she is given a seat on the High Council of Time Lords In New Adventures Happy Endings also by Cornell it is revealed that Romana has become Lady President of Gallifrey Romanas presidency is reflected in the later novels and in her appearances in audio dramas from Big Finish Productions Romana appears in independent charity novel Times Champion in the role of President of the Time Lords

In the BBC Books Eighth Doctor Adventures novels Romana undergoes a second regeneration and her new incarnation is far less sympathetic and far more ruthless than the other two

Romana II appeared pseudonymously in a series of audio plays produced in the early 2000s by BBV In this series Lalla Ward played a character who appeared with K 9 in an unnamed parallel universe This character is called the Mistress Because of an unusual copyright situation in which BBV was able to license K 9 but not Romana or other Doctor Who elements the Mistress is not explicitly called Romana For similar reasons the parallel universe is called a pocket universe in the series packaging

In Big Finishs regular line of Doctor Who audio stories Ward joined the Sixth Doctor in The Apocalypse Element in which Romana is Lady President of Gallifrey In Zagreus Romana II is forced to banish the Eighth Doctor from the universe as he has become a danger to it following his infection by the forces of anti time Following on from this she is featured in a number of audio plays with former Doctor companion Leela under the umbrella title of Gallifrey 

The series ends on a cliffhanger with Gallifrey on the brink of economic and social collapse as well as in danger of being overrun by a Free Time virus while most of the characters are trapped with no apparent means of escape

Tegan Jovanka is a fictional character in the long running British science fiction television series Doctor Who She was played by Janet Fielding Tegan Jovanka was an Australian airline stewardess who was a companion of the Fourth and Fifth Doctors she was a regular in the programme from 1981 to 1984 Tegan was the longest serving companion in terms of years on the series although Jamie McCrimmon was in the most episodes and stories

Tegan first appears in the Fourth Doctors last serial Logopolis On her way to Heathrow Airport to start her new job with Air Australia her car suffers a flat tyre She enters a roadside police box to seek help but she enters and does not realise that it is the Doctors Tardis She is present when the Fourth Doctor falls from the Pharos Project radio telescope and regenerates into his fifth incarnation and continues to travel with the doctor Eventually the chaos during the events of Resurrection of the Daleks prove too much and she chooses to leave the Doctor and Turlough and stay in 1984 London

According to David Tennants video diary of filming Doctor Who Series 3 John Barrowman has a dog named Tegan named after the companion

Empress Dowager Cixi1 popularly known in China as the West Dowager Empress was from the Manchu Yehe Nara Clan She was a powerful and charismatic figure who became the de facto ruler of the Manchu Qing Dynasty and ruled over China for 47 years from 1861 to her death in 1908 Though her exact origins are unclear it is very likely that she came from an ordinary Manchu family She was chosen by the Xianfeng Emperor as a concubine and so she gained almost total control over the court when the rule of her son the Tongzhi Emperor started He and her nephew the Guangxu Emperor attempted unsuccessfully to rule in their own right She was in Charge during the Opium Wars First Sino Japanese War and the Boxer Rebellion She was largely conservative during her rule and many historians consider her reign despotism and think that she might be responsible for the fall of the Qing Dynasty and therefore Imperial China as a result of Cixis rule

Jacques Offenbach was a French composer and cellist of the Romantic era He is seen as one of the originators of the operetta form Of German Jewish descent he was one of the most influential composers of popular music in Europe in the 19th century Many of his works are still played today

Offenbachs many operettas such as Orpheus in the Underworld and La belle Hlne were extremely popular both in France and elsewhere in the 1850s and 1860s They combined political and cultural satire with witty grand opera parodies His popularity in France declined in the 1870s after the fall of the Second Empire He fled France but during the last years of his life his popularity came back Several of his operettas are still performed While his name remains most closely associated with the French operetta and the Second Empire it is Offenbachs one fully operatic masterpiece Les contes dHoffmann composed at the end of his career that has become the most familiar of Offenbachs works in major opera houses

Henri de Toulouse Lautrec was a French painter of the Post Impressionist period He was born into a noble family but lived for most of his life among the actors dancers and prostitutes of Paris He is famous for painting the lives of these people the entertainment of Paris and many portraits 

He was expert at drawing and also made many printed posters to advertise entertainments

In a 2005 auction at Christies auction house a new record was set when La blanchisseuse an early painting of a young laundress sold for 224 million US

Henri Marie Raymond de Toulouse Lautrec Monfa was born in Albi in the Midi Pyrnes Region of France He was the oldest child of Count Alphonse and Countess Adle de Toulouse Lautrec His mother and father were cousins This is thought to have been a reason for his weakness and bad health His younger brother was born on 28 August 1867 but died the following year

Henri had two accidents when he was 13 and 14 He fractured the thigh bones of both his legs They took a long time to heal and never grew again No one knows exactly what caused this problem As an adult he had a man sized body but child sized legs and was 154 m tall

As a young man Toulouse Lautrec was not able to do many of the things that other men of his age liked doing He had been good at drawing from the time he was a child He spent his time drawing and painting instead of joining in sports and hunting He travelled to Paris where he met other artists as well as writers actors and dancers The night life of Paris had so many colourful scenes and people to paint His paintings are famous for showing the scenes of modern life in a way they had never been shown before 

Toulouse Lautrec lived in Montmartre a part of Paris that was famous for its bohemian people artists poets philosophers and poor students He was called the soul of Montmartre He often visited the nightclubs such as the Moulin Rouge He also spent a lot of time at the brothels in that area and lived for a time at the brothel at des Moulins where he was a good friend to many of the women there 

Toulouse Lautrec painted scenes of the lives of these people which were very shocking to some people in the polite society of Paris As well as showing the dancing singing acting and circus performances that many people enjoyed he also showed people in bed together the sad faces of people who were addicts and the half naked prostitutes lined up for STD medical examination Many of his pictures were of women in same sex relationships

He painted the singer Yvette Guilbert the dancer Jane Avril and the dancer Louise Weber who was known as La Goulue and who created the leg kicking dance called the Can Can which is still danced at the Moulin Rouge to this day Toulouse Lautrec gave painting lessons to Suzanne Valadon who was one of his models and may have also been his girlfirend 

Henri Toulouse Lautrec was an alcoholic for most of his adult life He was put into a psychiatric hospital shortly before his death He died from problems cause by addiction and STD at his familys home in Malrom He was nearly 37 years old He is buried in Verdelais Gironde a few kilometres from his birthplace

Throughout his working life of less than 20 years Toulouse Lautrec created 737 canvases 275 watercolors 363 prints and posters and 5084 drawings He also made some ceramics and stained glass After Toulouse Lautrecs death his mother the Countess Adle Toulouse Lautrec and his art dealer Maurice Joyant made his art famous His mother gave money for a museum of his works to be built in Albi his birthplace

Several films have been made about Toulouse Lautrec

Hersfeld Rotenburg is a Kreis in the east of Hesse Germany

In 1821 districts were created in Hesse including the districts Hersfeld and Rotenburg which stayed nearly unchanged after Hesse Kassel was taken over by Prussia In 1972 both districts were joined into one

The Saturnian moon Rhea may have a thin ring system with three narrow bands in a disk of solid particles These would be the first rings seen around a moon The discovery was announced in the journal Science on March 6 2008

In November of 2005 the Cassini orbiter found that Saturns magnetosphere near Rhea did not have energetic electrons According to the discovery team this is best explained by assuming they were absorbed by solid material in the form of an equatorial disk having denser rings or arcs with particles perhaps many decimeters to about a meter in diameter 

Voyager 1 saw an area without as many energetic electrons trapped in Saturns magnetic field downstream from Rhea in 1980 These measurements which were never explained were made at a farther distance than the Cassini data 

On November 26 2005 Cassini made the one targeted Rhea flyby of its primary mission It passed within 500 km of Rheas surface downstream of Saturns magnetic field and saw the resulting plasma wake as it had with other moons such as Dione and Tethys In those cases there was a cutoff of energetic electrons as Cassini crossed into the moons plasma shadows However in the case of Rhea the electron plasma started to drop off at eight times that distance and decreased gradually until the expected sharp drop off as Cassini entered Rheas plasma shadow The extended distance corresponds to Rheas Hill sphere the distance of 77 times Rheas radius inside of which orbits are dominated by Rheas rather than Saturns gravity When Cassini emerged from Rheas plasma shadow the reverse pattern occurred A sharp surge in energetic electrons then a gradual increase out to Rheas Hill sphere radius 

These readings are similar to those of Enceladus where water coming out from its south pole absorbs the electron plasma However in the case of Rhea the absorption pattern is symmetrical 

In addition the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument saw that this gentle gradient was punctuated by three sharp drops in plasma flow on each side of the moon a pattern that was also nearly symmetric

In August 2007 Cassini passed through Rheas plasma shadow again but farther downstream Its readings were similar to those of Voyager 1 

There are no images or direct sightings of the material thought to be absorbing the plasma but the likely candidates would be difficult to detect directly Further sightings are planned for Cassinis first mission extension with a targeted flyby scheduled for March 2 2010

Cassinis flyby path makes interpretation of the magnetic readings difficult

The obvious candidates for magnetospheric plasma absorbing matter are neutral gas and dust but the quantities required to explain the seen decrease in electrons are far higher than Cassinis measurements allow Therefore the finders led by Geraint Jones of the Cassini MIMI team argue that the decrease of electrons must be caused by solid particles orbiting Rhea An analysis of the electron data indicates that this obstacle is most likely in the form of a low optical depth disk of material near Rheas equatorial plane and that the disk contains solid bodies up to 1 m in size The simplest explanation for the symmetrical punctuations in plasma flow are extended arcs or rings of material orbiting Rhea in its equatorial plane These symmetric dips bear some similarity to the way by which the Rings of Uranus were found in 1977 

However not all scientists are convinced that the seen signatures are caused by a ring system No rings have been seen in images which puts a very low limit at least on tiny dust sized particles Furthermore a ring made of boulders would be expected to generate dust that would likely have been seen in the images

Simulations suggest that solid bodies can stably orbit Rhea near its equatorial plane over astronomical timescales They may not be stable around Dione and Tethys because those moons are so much closer to Saturn and therefore have much smaller Hill spheres or around Titan because of drag from its dense atmosphere

Many suggestions have been made for the possible origin of rings An impact could have brought material into orbit this could have happened as recently as 70 million years ago A small body could have been disrupted when caught in orbit about Rhea In either case the debris would eventually have settled into circular equatorial orbits Given their long term orbital stability however it is possible that they survive from the formation of Rhea itself 

For different rings to exist something must separate them Suggestions include moonlets or clumps of material within the disk similar to those seen within Saturns A ring

There are many international organizations in Geneva including the headquarters of many of the agencies of the United Nations and of the Red Cross A 2007 survey found Geneva to have the second highest quality of living in the world

Internationally Geneva is strongly associated with the Geneva Conventions

Geneva was first written about as a border town set up to protect the Roman Empire against the fortified against the Helvetii The Romans took the city in 120 BC In AD 443 it was taken by Burgundy and with the latter fell to the Franks in 534 In 888 the town was part of the new Kingdom of Burgundy and with it was taken over in 1033 by the German Emperor

From 1154 the bishops of Geneva had the status of prince of the Holy Roman Empire since 1154 but the counts of Geneva and later the counts of Savoy were guardians always ready to take over from the bishops In 1290 the counts of Savoy got the right to appoint a deputy ruler of the diocese the title of Vidame of Geneva was granted to the family of count Franois de Candie of Chambery Le Vieux a Chatellaine of the Savoy The vidame had some powers in the town 

In 1387 Bishop Adhmar Fabry granted the town its great charter the basis of its communal self government which every bishop on his accession was expected to confirm The last Count of Geneva died in 1394 and the House of Savoy took over their land In 1416 the counts became dukes and kept trying to bring the city of Geneva under their control often by making members of their own family to Bishops of Geneva The city protected itself by joining the Swiss Federation uniting itself in 1426 with Berne and Fribourg

In the Protestant Reformation Bern favoured the new Protestant teaching and demanded liberty of preaching for the Reformers Guillaume Farel and Antoine Froment but Catholic Fribourg renounced in its union with Geneva in 1511 Later the Protestant leader John Calvin was based in Geneva from 1536 to his death in 1564 

At the Congress of Vienna the territory of Geneva was enlarged to cover 15 Savoyard and 6 French parishes with more than 16000 Catholics at the same time it became a part of the Swiss Confederation The treaty said that Catholic religion was to be protected and that no changes were to be made without agreement with the Holy See Later Pope Pius VII made the cities of Geneva and Lausanne a new diocese of and part of Geneva diocese that was in France part of the French diocese of Annecy 

The Protestant and Old Catholic churches got money from the city taxes but the Roman Catholics did not On 30 June 1907 most of the Catholics of Geneva voted for the separation of Church and State

In Geneva the winter is cold and generally a little cloudy During the winter season it is possible to go several days without thawing and a day or two with severe freezes where the thermometer displays 10 C There are several days each month when if anticyclonic conditions are stable the clouds may stay for several days From March with temperatures rising it feels like summer in late May However the rain intensifies and often has a stormy character during the month of May These may be short but strong storms depositing several centimetres of rain within just a few minutes Summers are often hot and rather humid although some may be more changeable the mornings remain relatively fresh During the summer season the rains are less frequent but more intense This is the season where you most likely get thunderstorms with hail If the weather in early September is still hot it cools down quickly to become really cold in November The morning frosts are then reappearing Autumn is also the season of mists and the month of October is often the month with the most fog in the year The fog can be very intense restricting vision to less than 100 m in the areas outside the city

The citys main newspaper is the Tribune de Genve a daily newspaper founded on 1 February 1879 by James T Bates with a readership of about 187000 Le Courrier founded in 1868 was originally supported by the Roman Catholic Church but has been completely independent since 1996 Mainly focused on Geneva Le Courrier is trying to expand into other cantons in Romandy Both Le Temps and Le Matin are widely read in Geneva but both actually cover the whole of Romandy

Geneva is covered by the various French language radio networks of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation in particular the Radio Suisse Romande While these networks cover the whole of Romandy special programs related to Geneva are sometimes broadcast on some of the local frequencies in the case of special events such as elections Other local station broadcast from the city including RadioLac Radio Cit OneFM and World Radio Geneva Switzerlands only English language radio station

The main television channel covering Geneva is the Tlvision Suisse Romande while its headquarters are located in Geneva the programmes cover the whole of French speaking Switzerland Lman Bleu is a local TV channel founded in 1996 and distributed by cable Because Geneva is nearly surrounded by France many French television and radio channels can be picked up in Geneva

Theatre

Most theatre in Geneva is in French however there are several companies that stage regular English productions

Cinema

Movie going is a favorite activity in Geneva and there are plenty of theaters throughout the city Most movies are dubbed into French Because of the number of English speakers in the city movies may also be subtitled

Restaurants

In has over 1000 restaurants so it is the undisputed capital of cuisine in Switzerland However eating out can be expensive and many people drive the few kilometres over the border into France where prices are lower

Since 1818 a particular chestnut tree is used as the official herald of the spring in Geneva The sautier observes the tree and notes the day of arrival of the first bud While this event has no practical impact the sautier issues a formal press release and the local newspaper will usually mention the news In 2007 the first bud appeared on 2 March

Geneva celebrates Jeune genevois on the first Thursday following a Sunday in September By local tradition this commemorates when the news of the St Bartholomews Day massacre of Huguenots reached Geneva The Genevois joke that the federal equivalent holiday Jeune fdral is celebrated two weeks later on account of the rest of the country being a bit slow on the uptake

Genevans also traditionally celebrate the failure of a Savoyard attempt to invade the city in 1602 The celebration which takes place in December is called LEscalade and includes a parade in the Old Town a marathon and numerous costume parties across the city Inhabitants generally eat vegetable stew to commemorate a fictional character called Mre Royaume who is said to have thrown boiling hot soup on the Duke of Savoys men when they were climbing the walls of the city during the night Traditionally children are encouraged to knock on peoples doors and sing songs in old Genevan while teenagers generally throw eggs and flour at each other Another tradition is to cross a pot made of chocolate filled with marzepan vegetables while saying and so perished the enemies of the Republic

The main sport team in Geneva is Servette FC a football club founded in 1890 and named after a borough on the right bank of the Rhne River Servette was the only club to have remained in the top league in Switzerland since its creation in the 1930s however in 2005 management problems caused the bankruptcy of the clubs parent company causing the club to be demoted two divisions lower It is now playing in second division Geneva is also home of the Genve Servette Hockey Club who play in the Swiss Nationalliga A

The city of Geneva is divided into 8 quartiers or districts often made up of several conglomerated neighborhoods On the Left Bank these include Jonction Centre Plainpalais Acacias Eaux Vives and Champel while the Right Bank includes Saint Jean Charmilles Servette Petit Saconnex Grottes Saint Gervaise and Paquis Nations

Many people also work in the numerous offices of international organizations located in Geneva

Geneva Motor Show is one of the most important international auto shows The show is held at Palexpo a giant convention centre located next to the International Airport The show is so important that the Jet dEau is switched on for longer than usual because of all the visitors in the city during the show

The city is served by the Geneva Cointrin International Airport It is connected to both the Swiss railway network SBB CFF FFS and the French SNCF network including direct connections to Paris Marseille and Montpellier by TGV Geneva is also connected to the motorway systems of both Switzerland and France

Public transport by bus trolleybus or tram is provided by Transports Publics Genevois In addition to an extensive coverage of the city centre the network covers most of the municipalities of the Canton with a few lines extending into France Public transport by boat is provided by the Mouettes Genevoises which link the two banks of the lake within the city and by the Compagnie Gnrale de Navigation sur le lac Lman which serves more distant destinations such as Nyon Yvoire Thonon Evian Lausanne and Montreux using both modern diesel vessels and vintage paddle steamers

Trains operated by SBB connect the airport to the main station of Cornavin in six minutes and carry on to towns such as Nyon Lausanne Fribourg Montreux Neuchtel Berne Sion Sierre etc Regional train services are being increasingly developed towards Coppet and Bellegarde At the city limits two new stations have been created since 2002 Genve Scheron and Lancy Pont Rouge

In 2005 work started on the CEVA project first planned in 1884 which will connect Cornavin with the Cantonal hospital the Eaux Vives station and Annemasse in France The link between the main station and the classification yard of La Praille already exists from there the line will go mostly underground to the Hospital and the Eaux Vives where it will link up to the existing line to France Support for this project was obtained from all parties in the local parliament

The Canton of Genevas public school system has coles primaires cycles dorientation and the post obligatory collges the oldest of which is the Collge Calvin It is housed in the ancient buildings of the University of Geneva and could be considered one of the oldest public schools in the world

Geneva also has a wide choice of reputed private schools

As the Geneva authorities say the history of the city is closely related to that of the foreign communities Ever since the migration of foreigners to Geneva these communities have found refuge bringing their know how their customs and hope of a new life They have widely participated in the international influence of Geneva to its economic prosperity and also to the spreading of views and of science 

Many other communities or minorities are also very well represented in Geneva including sexual minorities with no less than three organizations Dialogai a gay organization Lestime a lesbian organization and association 360 an LGBT organization The Gay International Group is a good resource for gay foreigners tourists or expatriates Also a new LGBT group has debuted within the University of Geneva itself called Think Out This group addresses students and professors linked directly or indirectly with the matter of sexual diversity

There are a lot of different communities in Geneva Even if Geneva is supposed to be the Protestant Rome many religions are represented in Geneva The Plymouth Brethren have a thriving assembly there established since the days of John Nelson Darby Besides the Protestants the Catholic religion becomes more influential thanks to immigration from Latin countries The Jewish community is one of the oldest of Switzerland and the more recent Muslim community is emerging in this tolerant city

Geneva is the seat of the European headquarters of the United Nations and of many other inter governmental organizations including

Geneva was the seat of the League of Nations between 1919 and the leagues dissolution in 1946 It was first housed in the Palais Wilson and then in the Palais des Nations which now hosts the United Nations Numerous international non governmental organizations have also elected Geneva as their headquarters including

Concubinage is the state of a woman in a relationship with a man of higher social status that gives her less rights than a marriage In most of the cases the man has an official wife and one or more concubines Concubines have only limited rights of support from the man and their children have lower status than children born by the official wife or wives these legal rights distinguish a concubine from a mistress

Historically the family of a girl were in favour of a concubinage with an mighty man as it meant economic security for the woman But concubinage could also mean sexual slavery of one member of the relationship typically the woman who was a pleasure slave to the man

In the Western world there is no legal status of concubines as only monogamous marriages are allowed Any other relationship does not enjoy legal protection the woman is necessarily a mistress

A mistress is a mans long term female sexual partner and companion who is not married to him This term is especially used when the man is married to another woman The relationship is generally stable however the couple do not live together openly Also the relationship is usually but not always secret Rather often the man is paying for some of the womans living expenses A mistress has no legal relationship to the man that makes the difference to the status of a concubine 

The term can also be used to describe the other companion in a female same sex marriage Likewise a woman may be married to a man and have a mistress of her own

Historically the term was used for women who could afford a comfortable lifestyle because a wealthy man financed that so that she will be available for his sexual pleasure Such a woman could move between the roles of a mistress and a courtesan Today however the word mistress is used primarily to refer to the female companion of a man who is married to another woman in the case of an unmarried man it is usual to speak of a girlfriend 

The historically best known and most researched mistresses are the royal mistresses of European monarchs for example Madame de Pompadour In the courts of Europe particularly Versailles and Whitehall in the 17th and 18th centuries a mistress often had great power and influence A king might hold numerous mistresses but have a single favourite mistress or official mistress as with Louis XV and Mme de Pompadour 

Eastern Front can be one of the following

Italian Campaign can mean the following

The following is a list of the counties of Wisconsin

Gibbons belong to the group of lesser apes They are known for their ability to swing from one tree to another with great agility and swiftness White hand gibbons live in Sumatra Thailand and Malaysia

Gibbons are known to be the best tree travelers in the animal kingdom They almost seem to be flying as they swing themselves hand over hand through the trees Like great apes gibbons can also walk upright on the ground When they walk on the ground gibbons hold their long arms in the air to keep them from dragging 

Gibbons are singers too Their powerful voices travel for kilometers through the forests of Southeast Asia At times a male a female and their young get together and sing in a chorus These sounds help groups of gibbons stay in contact They also tell unwelcome visitors to stay away

Gibbons stay busy for most of the day They swing through the trees looking for leaves flowers fruit and insects to eat When night falls small groups settle down in familiar trees for a good nights rest

Unlike most other primates male and female gibbons are not very different in size and shape although they may differ in color The males are usually black while the females tend to be ash blond Female gibbons have one offspring per gestation period and live about 25 years 

Same sex marriage is a term for a relationship in which two people of the same sex live together as a family in a governmentally socially or religiously recognized marriage 

Marriage by the civil law is presently available to same sex couples at any place in some countries The countries that have them are the Netherlands South Africa Canada Argentina Iceland Sweden Spain Norway Portugal and Belgium The Netherlands was the first country to allow marriages of two people of the same sex in 2001

Some countries have them in some places and not others such as the states of Massachusetts Connecticut Iowa Vermont New Hampshire New York and the District of Columbia in the United States and Mexico City in Mexico 

In the Netherlands a same sex marriage law does not actually exist Back in 2001 the existing marriage law was only changed so that it now includes marriage of same sex partners This means that same sex marriage in the Netherlands is not different from a normal marriage its exactly the same The Dutch law says the following

That is consistent with the first article of the Dutch civil law and with the Dutch constitution

The first same sex union in modern history was recognized by the government in Denmark in 1989

Civil unions civil partnership domestic partnership unregistered partnershipunregistered co habitation or registered partnerships offer some of the benefits of marriage and are available in Andorra Australia Colombia Croatia Czech Republic Denmark Finland France Germany Hungary Iceland Israel Luxembourg New Zealand Norway Portugal Slovenia South Africa Sweden Switzerland the United Kingdom and Uruguay They are also available in some parts of Argentina Brazil Mexico the US states of California Connecticut Hawaii Maine New Hampshire New Jersey Oregon Vermont Washington state and the District of Columbia

In the United Kingdom civil partnerships have identical legal status to a marriage and partners have all the same benefits and legal rights ranging from tax exemptions and joint property rights to next of kin status and shared parenting responsibilities Partnership ceremonies are performed by a marriage registrar in exactly the same manner as a secular civil marriage

The controversy over recognition of same sex unions as marriages is a very important part of a larger debate about the definition of a family Same sex marriage is not considered as valid by many religions including the Catholic Church and Islam Many others however see same sex marriage as important for all people to be equal They sometimes say that religions who do not support same sex marriage are intolerant

Various organizations exist in part to support the rights of homosexual or gay men and women to marry people of the same sex One organization is the Human Rights Campaign or HRC

Chiron is the name given to a moon of Saturn claimed to be sighted by Hermann Goldschmidt in 1861 It has since been determined that it does not exist as it was never seen again

Dual monarchy is a union of two monarchies where the thrones of each monarchy are combined A typical case is a personal union in which the crowns of the separate kingdoms are held by one person The following are examples of dual monarchies listed alphabetically with the dominant or co dominant nation first

Union generally means that two or more things are joined into one That can be an organization of several people or organizations several objects combined into one and so on The term may mean

The term student union can be used in either of two senses

In Twilight Bella moves from Phoenix Arizona to Forks Washington to live with her father She enrolls at Forks High School There she meets the Cullens a family of vampires However because they believe it is not right they do not drink human blood they only drink animal blood Because of this they call themselves vegetarians They are described as beautiful and extremely pale with golden eyes that turn black when they become thirsty They are strong and can run very fast Their skin is ice cold After becoming vampires they do not physically change anymore They do not grow older When in the sun they sparkle like thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface according to Bella in Twilight

Bella quickly falls in love with Edward the youngest of the Cullens at 17 Bella is attached to him even after she finds out he is a vampire Only Bella knows they are vampires so she must tell no one of their existence

One night the Cullens are playing baseball with Bella watching when a smaller coven of vampires meets with them These vampires are not vegetarians they do drink human blood James one of the coven attempts to attack Bella However he did not attack because he was outnumbered 

Although James left Bella alive he is a tracker That means he hunts down his prey and kills it which he thinks of as a game He plans on tracking Bella She goes to Phoenix Arizona to escape the deadly vampire but he blackmails her into going to meet him They meet at Bellas old dance studio where Bella learns that her mother is still safe James almost kills her but the Cullens save her before she is dead They kill James and get Bella safely to a hospital The doctors tell her that she will make a full recovery in time though she has broken her leg

New Moon starts on September 13 Bellas 18th birthday she had been dreading this day because it would make her older than Edward her vampire boyfriend An incident happens at her birthday party and Bella gets hurt The fresh blood is too much for Jasper the Cullen least committed to their diet and he tries to attack her Carlisle the oldest vampire of the Cullens and the one most in control of himself fixes her wound and then Bella goes home

Edward believes he is putting Bella in too much danger just by being around her The Cullens leave and Edward says goodbye to Bella after telling her that he does not love her anymore Before leaving he makes her promise not to do anything reckless and then promises her that this would be the last time she saw him She tries to follow him after he leaves but ends up getting lost in the woods She is found later that night by Sam Uley a Quileute man from the nearby Indian reservation in La Push

After that night Bella goes into a depressed state She does not talk to anyone except to answer direct questions She does not do anything except go to school and work This is too much for her father and he tells her that he is going to make her go to Florida to live with her mother Bella protests this and to make her father happy she and her friend Jessica go to a movie

After the movie Bella has a delusion in which she hears Edwards voice clearly in her head She wakes up after this She decides to break her promise to him that she would not do anything stupid She visits Jacob Black her childhood friend to see if he can fix up two motorcycles that she got for free They quickly become friends Jacob makes Bella happy for the first time since Edward left her

When they ride the motorcycles for the first time Bella hears Edwards voice again She realizes that she hears it whenever she is in danger She hears the delusion again when she meets Laurent the other male in James coven He tells her that Victoria James mate is out to seek revenge on Edward for killing James He is about to kill Bella when five large wolves chase him down and kill him

Bella also learns of Sam Uley the day she first rides the motorcycle Sam Uley and his cult as Jacob describes them are cliff diving Jacob is scared that Sam is doing something to control the young men on he reservation When Jacob suddenly breaks off their friendship Bella suspects that Sam has gotten to him When Jacob sees how upset Bella is over their broken friendship he makes her guess that he is a werewolf because he cannot tell anyone that and also that it is dangerous for him to be around her He tells Bella that Sam is a werewolf and his cult was actually a pack of the werewolves in La Push He says that their purpose is to keep their reservation safe and they call them selves protectors and reveals that they were the wolves she had seen who had chased down Laurent He tells her that they are still trying to kill Victoria

The werewolves are hunting Victoria one day and Bella is alone on the beach in La Push she decides to go cliff diving She nearly drowns in the water but Jacob saves her Alice sees Bella jump off the cliff and goes to Forks to try to help Charlie with the loss But she finds Bella still alive and Bella is extremely happy at their reunion 

Rosalie the only Cullen who did not like Bella tells Edward that Bella is dead He plans to kill himself by going to Italy and asking the Volturi vampire royalty to kill him Bella and Alice go to Italy to show him that she is still alive After barely escaping the Volturi Edward Alice and Bella go back to Forks with the rest of the Cullens They return to Forks and Edward tells Bella that he was lying when he told her he did not love her and that he would never leave her again Bella takes the Cullens votes and everyone except Rosalie and Edward say she should join their family as a vampire

In Eclipse Jacob and Bellas friendship is shaken by the Cullens return Jacob will not visit Bella or answer any of her telephone calls This has Bella upset and wants to visit La Push but she is still grounded for her sudden disappearance to Italy Charlie blames Edward for Bellas depression and restricted the time he spends at his house

Charlie suddenly ungrounds Bella one day and she is free to see Jacob But when she plans one night to go see him Edward has disabled her truck so she cannot go He says that young werewolves are unsafe that they can lose control and end up hurting those near them Despite this when he is away hunting Bella goes to see Jacob

Meanwhile a string of murders are happening in Seattle and the Cullens believe there is a newborn vampire loose in Seattle However as the number of murders increases they begin to suspect an army of newborn vampires Jasper tells Bella of his part in vampire wars in the South He explained how vampires would create armies of newborn vampires to take control of cities where there was more blood

While Bella is away at the Cullens one night an intruder breaks into her house and steal some of her things to get the scent of her blood The Cullens do not know why or how this happened but Bella realizes the day of her graduation that whoever had broken in was part of the newborn army in Seattle He had taken her things so the others could find her

When the werewolves find out about the newborn army they decide to help the Cullens fight them This greatly relieves Cullens and the werewolves are excited about the fight Alice with her visions of the future sees the newborns coming to a clearing near Forks to attack To make sure Bella is safe she is to go to a place in the mountains away from the fight To make sure no one can follow her scent Jacob Black carries her there Edward and one of the younger werewolves would stay with her there while the battle goes on

While the Cullens and werewolves fight in the clearing Victoria and her mate Riley follow Edwards scent to where he and Bella are Edward kills Victoria and he and the werewolf both help kill Riley By the time they have done this the fight in the clearing is over But when one of the werewolves is attacked from behind by a newborn vampire who had been hiding Jacob Black tries to rescue her and gets hurt

The hexadecimal numeral system also known as just hex is a numeral system made up of 16 symbols It uses the common symbols in the decimal numeral system and includes six extra symbols These symbols are characters taken from the English alphabet A B C D E and F The hexadecimal system replaced the octal numeral system for much of the work done on computers The most commonly used form of binary is the byte This is eight binary digits Hexadecimal only needs two digits to show the information in one byte of data As computers become more advanced they tend to use larger groups of bits but they use multiples of 8 Hexadecimal makes it easier to write these large binary numbers Hexadecimal numbers are written with a h after the number For example 63h means 63 hexadecimal

Hexadecimal is similar to the octal numeral system because each can be easily compared to the binary numeral system Hexadecimal uses a four bit binary coding This means that each digit in hexadecimal is the same as four digits in binary Octal uses a three bit binary system 

Changing a number from binary to hex uses a grouping method The binary number is separated into groups of four digits starting from the right These groups are then converted to hexadecimal digits as shown in the chart above for the hexadecimal numbers 0 through F To change from hexadecimal the reverse is done The hex digits are each changed to binary and the grouping is usually removed  

To convert a number from hexadecimal to decimal do the following

1 Take the least significant hexadecimal digit That is the digit on the right end If it is 0 thru 9 leave it at that value If it is A or above convert it to 10 thru 15 This will be the first item in a sum

2 Take the second least significant digit That is next to the digit on the right end Do the above but multiply the value obtained by 16 Add this to the sum

3 Take the third least significant digit and convert is as in 1 above then multiply it by 162 Add it to the sum

4 Repeat the above for more places For each new place add one more to the power of 16 Because hexadecimal uses extra symbols it is important to remember the decimal value of each of the symbols A 10 B 11 C 12 D 13 E 14 and F 15 

Example 5Fh and 3425h to decimal

It was first reported to fans of WWE on their WWE Mobile Alerts Service and posted to their official website soon after On their website World Wrestling Entertainment released the following statement

WWE cancelled the scheduled three hour long live Raw show on June 25 and replaced the broadcast version with a tribute to his life and career featuring his past matches segments from the Hard Knocks The Chris Benoit Story DVD and comments from wrestlers and announcers However once the details of the events became apparent WWE quickly and quietly began distancing itself from the wrestler by removing merchandise and no longer mentioning him

Media accusations of steroid use and roid rage quickly surfaced after the killings prompting negative publicity against WWE and professional wrestling overall Toxicology reports released on July 17 2007 revealed that at their time of death Nancy Benoit had three different drugs in her system Xanax hydrocodone and hydromorphone all of which were found at the therapeutic rather than toxic levels Daniel Benoit was found to have Xanax in his system which led the chief medical examiner Kris Sperry to believe that he was sedated before he was murdered Chris Benoit was found to have Xanax hydrocodone and an elevated level of testosterone caused by a synthetic form of testosterone in his system The chief medical examiner attributed the testosterone level to Benoit possibly being treated for a deficiency caused by previous steroid abuse There was no indication that anything in Chris body contributed to his violent behavior that led to the murder suicide concluding that there was no roid rage involved

On August 30 2007 Benoit was discovered to have been given illegal steroids not in compliance with WWEs Talent Wellness Program in February 2006 Benoit received nandrolone and anastrozole Eddie Guerrero and Brian Adams were discovered to have been given steroids prior to their deaths during this investigation as well as former WWE superstar Sylvain Grenier and eleven other WWE superstars who were suspended in accordance with the WWE Talent Wellness program

After the double murder suicide former wrestler Chris Nowinski contacted Michael Benoit father of Chris Benoit suggesting that years of trauma to his sons brain may have led to his actions Tests were conducted on Benoits brain by Julian Bailes the head of neurosurgery at West Virginia University and results showed that Benoits brain was so severely damaged it resembled the brain of an 85 year old Alzheimers patient It was also shown to have an advanced form of dementia and was similar to the brains of four retired NFL players who have suffered multiple concussions sank into depression and harmed themselves or others Bailes and his colleagues concluded that repeated concussions can lead to dementia which can contribute to severe behavioral problems Benoits father suggests that brain damage may have been the leading cause of his crime He also confirmed that his son was quietly cremated but what was done with the ashes is not public knowledge

WSB TV in Atlanta Georgia obtained the last known photograph of Chris Benoit The photo was taken in the office of Dr Phil Astin on Friday June 22 2007 just mere hours before the murders

1 note1 Benoits reign with the championship is not officially recognized by World Wrestling Entertainment No reign prior to December of 1997 is recognized by the promotion

Hipparchus was a Greek astronomer geographer and mathematician He lived in the Hellenistic period

Hipparchus was born in Nicaea and probably died on the island of Rhodes He worked as an astronomer at least from 147 BC to 127 BC Hipparchus is considered the greatest ancient astronomical observer Some people see him as the greatest overall astronomer of antiquity He was the first Greek whose quantitative and accurate models for the motion of the Sun and Moon survive To get to these models he certainly made use of the observations and perhaps the mathematical techniques accumulated over centuries by the Chaldeans from Babylonia He had a trigonometric table It looks like he solved some problems of spherical trigonometry with the table With his solar and lunar theories and his trigonometry he was perhaps the first to develop a reliable method to predict solar eclipses His other well known achievements include the discovery of precession the compilation of the first comprehensive star catalog of the western world and possibly the invention of the astrolabe He might also have invented the armillary sphere which first appeared during his century and was used by him during the creation of much of the star catalogue It would be three centuries before Claudius Ptolemaeus synthesis of astronomy would make the work of Hipparchus obsolete it is heavily dependent on it in many areas

Uluru also called Ayers Rock is a name given to a huge rock near Alice Springs in the Australian Outback This is a holy place for Australian aborigines It is located at the Western Desert in the middle of Australia It was listed as a World Heritage site in 1987 because of its geology In 1997 it was again listed as a World Heritage site this time because of its importance to the Anangu people It was the second place in the world to be listed as culturally significant and it is one of the few places in the world to have two listings

The Anangu people believe that Uluru and the rest of Central Australia was formed by ancestral beings at the beginning of time The Anangu are directly descended from these ancestors 

Modern science shows that they have lived around Uluru for more than 40000 years They continued to live their traditional life until the 1930s This was a nomadic life moving around to hunt and gather food according to the seasons They have a complex ceremonial life based around Uluru They are one of the oldest human societies on earth

The first Europeans to see Uluru were explorers led by William Christie Gosse He saw Uluru on 19 July 1873 and  named it Ayers Rock after Sir Henry Ayers who was Chief Secretary of South Australia The land was too dry and remote for farming and very few people came to Uluru until the mid 20th century

The Elapidae or elapids are a family of venomous snakes These snakes can be found in tropical and subtropical regions around the world They can also be found in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific They are characterized by a set of hollow fixed fangs through which they inject venom There are snakes of different sizes from only 18 cm up to 6 m in length Currently 61 genera with 231 species are known

Those elapids that live on land look a lot like the colubrids almost all have long and slender bodies with smooth scales a head that is covered with large shields and not always distinct from the neck and eyes with round pupils In addition their behavior is usually quite active and most are oviparous There are exceptions to all these generalizations For example the death adders include short and fat rough scaled very broad headed cat eyed live bearing sluggish ambush predators with partly fragmented head shields

Some species spend most of their lives in trees or bushes this is called arboreal Many others are specialised burrowers Some species have very generalised diets Others have specialised on a certain kind of prey They have also adapted themselves to better be able to feed on other snakes certain lizards squamate eggs mammals birds frogs fish etc 

Sea snakes which are also elapids have adapted to a marine way of life in different ways All have evolved their tails so they can be used for swimming They can also excrete salt Most also have changed bodies better suited for swimming Ventral scales are much reduced in size the nostrils of the snakes are located dorsally They give birth to live young In general they have the ability to breathe through their skin experiments with the yellow bellied sea snake Pelamis platurus have shown that this species can satisfy about 20 of its oxygen requirements in this manner Thia makes it possible to stay underwater longer The sea kraits are the least well adapted to an aquatic life They spend much of their time on land where they also lay their eggs They have wide ventral scales the tail is not as well developed for swimming and their nostrils are separated by internasal scales

All elapids have a pair of proteroglyphous fangs that are used to inject venom from glands located towards the rear of the upper jaws The fangs are the first two teeth on each maxillary bone which are enlarged and hollow and usually only one is in place on each side at any time The maxilla is intermediate in length and mobility between typical colubrids and viperids When the mouth is closed the fangs fit into grooved slots in the buccal floor in the longest fanged elapids it is common for the fangs to pierce right through the intermandibular skin which does not seem to endanger the snake The fangs are usually below the front edge of the eye and are angled backwards due to this construction most elapids must actually bite in order to envenomate This action is therefore not as quick as with the viperids that can envenomate with only a quick stabbing motion Some elapids have long fangs on quite mobile maxillae and can therefore make very fast stabbing strikes like viperids A few species are capable of spraying their venom from forward facing holes at the tips of their fangs as a means of defense Elapids use their venom both to immobilize their prey and in self defense

All elapids are venomous and many are potentially deadly The venoms are mostly neurotoxic and are considered more dangerous than the mainly proteolytic viper venoms Members include the black mamba a species many regard as the worlds most dangerous snake the fierce snake which is the most venomous land snake to mice and Hydrophis belcheri a sea snake and the most toxic venom of all snakes

A colubrid is a snake that is a member of the Colubridae family It is a broad classification of snakes that includes well over half of all snake species on earth A colubrids body is almost completely covered in scales While most colubrids are non venomous and are normally harmless a few groups such as genus Boiga can produce medically significant bites In addition the Boomslang and African Twig Snake have both caused human fatalitiesThe venom injecting fangs associated with venomous colubrids are almost always in the back of the mouth compared to vipers and elapids The Colubrids are certainly not a natural group as many are more closely related to other groups such as elapids than to each other This family has classically been a dumping ground for snakes that do not fit anywhere else There is on going mitochondrial DNA research which will sort out the familial relations within this group

Sea snakes or seasnakes are poisonous elapid snakes that live in marine environments for most or all of their lives Together with sea turtles they are among the best known marine reptiles They evolved from their ancestors who lived on land Some sea snakes still have some of the behaviour and traits of their ancestors left Most sea snakes are well adapted to living in the water all the time They are unable to even move on land 

Sea snakes are found in warm coastal waters from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific They live in the tropical and warm regions and they can not be found in the Atlantic Ocean along the North American coast or in the Caribbean Sea

Most sea snakes grow to sizes between 12m and 14m some can reach 2m or more Hydrophis cyanocinctus have been found to reach 25m Hydrophis spiralis 3m They reach a weight of about 08 13kg at a size of 18m In most cases females are larger than males 

All sea snakes have paddle like tails and many have laterally compressed bodies they look somewhat like eels However unlike fish they do not have gills and must come to the surface regularly to breathe Nevertheless they are among the most completely aquatic of all air breathing vertebrates Among this group are species with some of the most potent poisons of all snakes Some have gentle dispositions and bite only when provoked while others are much more aggressive Currently 17 genera are described as sea snakes with 62 species They are usually 3 to four feet long

All snakes are good swimmers but only real sea snakes live their whole lives in the ocean Not only do they live there they eat there and even have their young right inside the water They can not even live on land If they accidentally get forced onto land by a storm or powerful currents they are unable to move Sea snakes have no scutes so if a sea snake ends up on a beach it is unable to slither back out to sea Instead sea snakes have a broken wikt linkpaddlepaddle shaped tail The tail needs to be paddle shaped so the snake can swim well 

Sea snakes also have special nostrils that can close when they go underwater and open when they come up to breathe like the blowhole of a whale The nostrils are found high up on the head so that the entire snake can stay under the water when they come up to breathe As a sea snake looks for food sometimes it has go dive deep down into the water and hold its breath for a long time So they have a lung that is almost as long as its whole body 

Most sea snakes are able to breathe through their skin This is unusual for reptiles because their skin is thick and scalyExperiments with the black and yellow sea snake Pelamis platurus have shown that this species can satisfy about 20 of its oxygen requirements in this manner which allows for prolonged dives

A sea snake can take one breath and stay under water for two whole hours 

Like other land animals that have adapted to life in a marine environment sea snakes swallow considerably more salt than their relatives living on land They do this through their diet and when they inadvertently swallow sea water This means that they had to find a better way to regulate the concentration of salt in their blood that those of their land living relativesMammals have the advantage of being able to pass salt in solution mostly in the urine but kidney function in birds and reptiles is too weak to remove enough salt In birds such as penguins salt is removed through nasal glands The marine iguanas of the Galapagos Islands use the same mechanism Sea turtles have lacrimal glands that allow them to produce very salty tears But in sea snakes the posterior sublingual glands located under and around the tongue sheath evolved to allow them to expel salt with their tongue action

Most sea snakes have strong poisons When bites occur only a small amount of poisons is injected For this reason the symptoms of the poisoning are only seen as trivial or do not exist at all For example Pelamis platurus has a venom more potent than any other terrestrial snake species in Costa Rica The snake is very common in the waters of the western coast of Costa Rica Despite this few human deaths have been reported Nevertheless all sea snakes should be handled with great caution

Bites in which poisoning occurs are usually painless and may not even be noticed when contact is made Teeth may be left in the wound There is usually little or no swelling involved and it is rare for any nearby lymph nodes to be affected The most important symptoms are rhabdomyolysis and paralysis Early symptoms include headache a thick feeling tongue thirst sweating and vomiting Symptoms that can occur after 30 minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching stiffness and tenderness of muscles all over the body Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful and trismus which is similar to tetanus is common This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other elapid poisonings a progressive flaccid paralysis starting with ptosis and paralysis of voluntary muscles Paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing and respiration can be fatal After three to eight hours myoglobin may start to show up in the blood plasma This is a result of muscle breakdown It can cause the urine to turn a dark reddish brown or black in color and eventually lead to kidney failure After six to twelve hours severe hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrest The hyperkalemia is also the result of muscle breakdown

Most sea snakes have extremely poisonous venom though some do not Of the more than fifty species of sea snakes almost all of them are dangerously poisonous Though the broken wikt linkvenomvenom of many snakes take some time to begin working sea snake venom is quite fast acting it can broken wikt linkparalyzeparalyze its victim instantly One bite makes the prey unable to move This helps sea snakes catch the broken wikt linkpreyprey that they want All they have to do is bite their prey and it cannot escape

The fact is sea snake venom is known to be the most poisonous of all snakes The most feared sea snake is the beaked sea snake found in the South Pacific It has fangs that are so long they can broken wikt linkpiercepierce through a thick broken wikt linkwetsuitwetsuit One drop of its venom can kill five adult men and it has enough of this powerful venom that if it was all released it could kill 53 grown men

Sea snakes can bite and release its venom up to an hour after it is dead even if its head is cut off This is because the snakes bite broken wikt linkreflexreflex is still active for some time after it has died

When you are bitten by a sea snake you can see a number of broken wikt linksymptomsymptoms happening to you Symptoms are often slow but they may happen in minutes or up to 8 hours after a sea snake bite These are the symptoms

Trench warfare is a war tactic or way of fighting It was commonly used on the Eastern Front and the Western Front in the First World War

In trench warfare the two sides fighting each other dig trenches in a battlefield These trenches have many different parts such as bunks headquarters artillery and machine gun bunks Between the two trenches on a battlefield there was an area called no mans land This area was often covered with barbed wire and land mines Soldiers on either side would try to cross the no mans land to get to the enemys trench and attack Tanks were commonly used to cross this land

Trench warfare was used because it gave soldiers cover while defending themselves against attack It also gave soldiers bunks to sleep in although the bunks were very unclean and uncomfortable

A device controller is a part of a computer system that makes sense of the signals going to and coming from the CPU There are many device controllers in a computer system Any device connected to the computer is connected by a plug and socket and the socket is connected to a device controller Device controllers use binary and digital codes Each device controller has a local buffer and a command register It communicates with the CPU by interrupts A devices controller plays an important role in the operation of that device it functions as a bridge between the device and the operating system

The Device Controller receives the data from a connected device and stores it temporarily in some special purpose registers inside the controller Then it communicates the data with a Device Driver For each device controller there is an equivalent device driver which is the standard interface through which the device controller communicates with the Operating Systems through Interrupts Device controller is a hardware whereas device driver is a software The controllers job is to convert the serial bit stream to block bytes and perform any error correction necessary

Rostov on Don is a city in the European part of Russia It is located on the River Don about 46 km before it flows into the Sea of Azov The city is the administrative center of Rostov Oblast and the Southern Federal District of Russia About 1 million people live in the city

The mouth of the Don River has been very impotant since the ancient times It has been important for cultural reasons and for trade The Greek colony Tanais was there and also the Genoese fort Tana Later the Ottoman Empire built a fortress there This fortress was named Azov

Rostov on Don was founded in 1749 In that year a customs house was built on the Don Later a large fortress followed It was named after Saint Dimitry of Rostov Dmitry of Rostov was a bishop from the old Northern town Rostov the Great With the time the importance of the fortress Asov became less and less The settlement near the fortress became more important than the fortress It was the commercial centre of the region In 1796 this settlement received city rights and was renamed Rostov on Don

The Don River that the city is named afrer is a major shipping lane It connects southwestern Russia with regions to the north Rostov on Don is an important river port both for people and industrial shipping With such a good geographical location the city grew quickly It is the most industrialized city of South Russia Because of this the city caused a large problem between the Whites and the Bolsheviks during the Civil War By 1928 the regional government was moved from the old Cossack capital Novocherkassk to Rostov The nearby Armenian town of Nor Nakhijevan became a part of the city

The city was also the home of Russias most well known serial killer Andrei Chikatilo but he was not actually born there

Rostov on Don has had much economic growth in recent years Part of this is because the Russian economy is getting stronger Many new companies have built headquarters in the city People living in the city are making more money than they did in the past The city is being changed from a place thrown back in time by the collapse of communism into a modern industrial and technology rich city

Public educational institutions include Southern Federal University and Don State Technical University The major private university in the city is the Institute of Management Business and Law There is also a French cultural center run by Alliance Francaise a British Council a Goethe Institut and a Bosch Foundation

WWE Heat was a professional wrestling show made by the World Wrestling Entertainment 

During its televised history in the United States it was shown on the USA Network MTV and Spike TV

From 2005 to 2008 it was streamed on WWEcom on Fridays for North American viewers However it was still televised in internationally The final episode was streamed on May 30 2008

Internationally it was replaced by WWE Vintage Collection a program which featured matches from past WWE events and hosted by WWE 2006 Hall of Fame inductee Mean Gene Okerlund

The show made its debut on August 2 1998 on the USA Network as WWF Sunday Night Heat It began as the second most important show in WWF Programming second to WWF Monday Night Raw Heat would feature backstage interview segments and in ring action Main event stars such as The Rock Mankind and Triple H would appear often to help further the storylines which occurred on Monday Night Raw Heat itself lead to a big ratings draw for the USA Network

When SmackDown was created in 1999 Heats importance lowered as well as ratings With the debut of SmackDown it lead to Heat being taped before SmackDown When SmackDown debuted in August 1999 it briefly became a recap show with exclusive interviews and feuds from the past of WWF Programming being made into music videos This only lasted a couple of weeks as it returned to airing exclusive matches

The WWF also aired two Halftime HEAT television specials which aired during Super Bowl XXXIII on the USA Network During this period the show moved to MTV as part of a deal between Viacom and the WWE When the show moved to MTV it began broadcasting live from WWF New York

In 2002 the show reverted to its previous format of taping the matches before Raw Since the brand extension in 2002 Heat became exclusive to the Raw brand the only exception to this was pay per view nights which were broadcast live from the PPV venues and could involve wrestlers from the SmackDown brand

In 2002 SmackDown branched off its own secondary show called Velocity which mirrored the same format as Heat

Heat and Velocity were not picked up by the USA Network when WWE moved Raw back to the USA Network in October 2005 This left Americans no way of watching the weekend programmes on Television WWE then made a decision to begin streaming these programmes on WWEcom exclusively for the United States audience Sunday Night Heat soon was renamed WWE Heat as it no longer aired on Sundays

Heat was still broadcast internationally due to previous programme commitments For a short time a special 30 minute live edition of Heat began airing in place of the traditional pre taped Free For All PPV pre show This lasted from No Mercy 2005 to Backlash 2006

When WWE began airing in high definition Heat began using the same set as Raw SmackDown and ECW

The final episode was streamed on WWEcom on May 30 2008 and was replaced internationally by WWE Vintage Collection

The President of the Confederation leads meetings of the federal government of Switzerland

Under the Swiss constitution of 1999 the Federal Council is the highest executive authority Although the president of the confederation has some extra duties to represent Switzerland he is not the head of state

All decisions are that a head of state would make are decided by a meeting of the Federal Council For example treaties are signed on behalf of the Federal Council and all members of the federal council sign the letters of credence to introduce ambassadors sent by Switzerland to a foreign country All ambassadors sent by a foreign country to Switzerland meet all of the members of the Federal Council not just the President 

The President of the Confederation is sometimes called the primus inter pares in the Federal Council

Only three other countries in the world do not have one person as a head of state Bosnia and Herzegovina Andorra and San Marino 

Nabta Playa was once a large basin in the Nubian Desert It is about 500 miles south of modern day Cairo or about 100 kilometers west of Abu Simbel of southern Egypt 22 32 north 30 42 east Many archaeological sites have been found there

From around the 10th millennium BC this area began to get more rainfall than before Because of the extra rainwater a lake formed Early people may have come here because there was water available They could only graze their cattle where there was grass and grass only grew next to water

Archaeologists say that the first people came to the region between the 10th and 8th millennia BC These peoples were growing domesticated cattle and using ceramic pottery The ceramics had complicated painted patterns on them These patterns may have been made by using combs

By the 7th millennium BC more developed settlements may be found in the area They also used deep wells for water Huts are found built in straight rows People also lived from fruit legumes millets sorghum and tubers 

A little later in 7th millennium BC there seem to have been more goats and sheep These most likely came from Southwest Asia There were also many large hearths at this time

Archaeological findings show that these prehistoric peoples led livelihoods seemingly at a higher level of organization than those who came after them who lived closer to the Nile Valley

Findings also show that the region was occupied only seasonally This means that people only lived there in the summer when the local lake filled with water for grazing cattle Analysis of human remains show that the people who lived here may have migrated from sub Saharan Africa

By the 6th millennium BC there may have been a prehistoric religion or cult Sacrificed cattle were found buried in stone roofed chambers lined with clay Some people think that this cattle cult in Nabta Playa may be related to Ancient Egypts Hathor cult An example of this connection may be that Hathor was worshiped as a nighttime protector in desert regions

Though the religious practices of the region involving cattle show possible ties to Ancient Egypt Egyptologist Mark Lehner says

This basically means that though there is evidence there is no direct proof showing that the cattle cult was connected to Hathor

By the 5th millennium BC these peoples had fashioned one of the worlds earliest known astronomical device about 1000 years older than but comparable to Stonehenge Research suggests that it may have been a prehistoric calendar which accurately marks the summer solstice

The research done by the astrophysicist Thomas G Brophy suggests that these monoliths might tell much more The calendar circle itself is made up of one doorway that runs north south a second that runs northeast southwest marking the summer solstice and six center stones Brophys theory proposes first that three of the center stones match the belt of Orion at its minimum tilt and the other three match the shoulder and head stars of Orion at their maximum tilt This cycle repeats approximately every 25000 years following the precession of the equinoxes The last minimum of Orions belt occurred between 6400 BC and 4900 BC matching the radio carbon dating of campfires around the circle

The stone circle at Nabta Playa is built precisely on what was then the Tropic of Cancer the suns farthest North point of travel that is today about 23 degrees 40 minutes NFactdateDecember 2007 Such a site would interest the wise men of the megalithic era and some would travel many days to erect such a site and then study thereFactdateDecember 2007

Another stone megalithic structure exists which consists of a central radial stone and several other stones in the distance In interpreting this Brophy found that the lines made to these stones from the radial stone match the spots in the sky where the various stars marked by the center stones in the calendar circle at the time they rose as the vernal equinox heliacal rising In analyzing the varying distances mulling through assumptions such as that they represented the brightness of the stars he inadvertently found that they matched the distance of the stars from Earth on a scale of 1 meter 799 light years within the margin of error for astronomical distances calculated today

In computing a video card is a special circuit board that controls what is shown on a computer monitor and calculates 3D images and graphics 

A video card can handle two types of video images First they can be used to display a two dimensional image like a Windows desktop or a three dimensional image like a computer game Computer Assisted Drawing programs are often used by architects and designers to create 3D models on their computers If a computer has a very fast video card the architect can create very detailed 3D models

Many computers have a basic video and graphics capabilities built in to the computers motherboard These onboard video chips are not as fast as normal graphics cards They are fast enough for basic computer use and even some basic computer games If a computer user wants faster and more detailed graphics a video card can be installed

Video cards have their own processor The GPU separate from the main computer processor The CPUs job is to process all the calculations needed to make the computer function The GPUs job is to handle 3D graphics calculations so the CPU does not have to 3D graphics calculations take a lot of CPU power so having a video card to handle the graphics calculations lets the CPU focus on other things like running computer programs 

Video cards also have their own memory separate from the main computer memory It is usually much faster than main computer memory too This helps the GPU do its graphics calculations even faster Most video cards also allow more than one monitor to be plugged in at one time This lets the computer user use more than one monitor at once Graphics manufacturers nVidia and ATI have special technologies that allow two identical cards to be linked together in a single computer for much faster performance nVidia calls their technology SLI and ATI calls their technology CrossFire Some modern graphics cards can even process physics calculations to create even more realistic looking 3D worlds

Video cards typically connect to a motherboard using the Peripheral Component Interconnect the Advanced Graphics Port or the Peripheral Component Interconnect Express PCI E is the newest and fastest connection most new video cards and motherboards have this connection Before PCI E was used AGP was the standard connection for video cards Before AGP video cards were designed for PCI 

In early computing years graphics processing was very basic and could be done by the CPU along with all the other processing However as computer games advanced and started using 3D graphics the CPU had too much to do and CPU makers could not keep up on making them faster Eventually video cards were invented to solve this problem Video cards are designed to have their own processor called the Graphics Processing Unit or GPU This lets the CPU do more work since it does not have to spend any time on advanced graphics calculations it can simply pass these calculations off to the GPU to be done

The first video cards connected to the motherboard via the ISA connection The first popular non IBM video cards were manufactured by a company called Hercules Computer Technology Inc Throughout the years the importance of video cards has grown As they evolved a new connection standard was developed called Advanced Graphics Port This was the first motherboard connection designed exclusively for video cards It was much faster at transferring information between the video card and the rest of the computer Eventually the AGP connection became outdated and a new connection called PCI Express became the standard for video cards Most video cards manufactured today use PCI E to connect to the motherboard

No Mercy is a musical group consisting of twins Ariel Gabriel Hernndez and Marty Cintron They are well known for their song Where Do You Go

Carlo Gesualdo known as Gesualdo da Venosa Prince of Venosa and Count of Conza was an Italian music composer lutenist and murderer He lived in the late part of the Renaissance period  He is famous for his beautifully expressive madrigals which are written in a very chromatic style He is also remembered for committing a horrible murder

Gesualdo came from an aristocratic family He was probably born at Venosa but we know hardly anything about his early life We know that he was extremely interested in music when he was small and showed very little interest in anything else He played the lute harpsichord and guitar

In 1586 Gesualdo married his first cousin Donna Maria dAvalos the daughter of the Marquis of Pescara Two years later she began to have a love affair with Fabrizio Carafa the Duke of Andria For two years her husband knew nothing about her love affair Then one day he returned unexpectedly to his palace and found them making love He murdered them both in their bed He then left their bodies in front of the palace for everyone to see In those days in Italy a nobleman could not be arrested and punished However someone might have wanted to kill him in revenge so he ran away to the town of Gesualdo where he had a castle

A lot of people heard about the murders Famous poets such as Tasso wrote poems about it Nothing was done to arrest Gesualdo however Some people at the time said that he also murdered one of Marias babies because he thought he might not have been the father Other people even said that he murdered his father in law when he came wanting to kill him in revenge but we do not know whether this was true

In 1594 Gesualdo went to the town of Ferrara which was famous for music which was being composed by modern composers experimenting with new ideas He spent two years there and composed his first book of madrigals There he married another woman who was a niece of Duke Alfonso II dEste The couple moved back to Gesualdo in 1597

After returning to his castle at Gesualdo from Ferrara in 1595 he tried to make the town famous for music He invited some of Italys most famous musicians to come and work for him Since he was very rich he could afford to do this However the music making only took place in his castle Gesualdo spent the last years of his life doing nothing except music He hardly ever left his castle 

Gesualdos new marriage was not a happy one His wife said he was cruel and she tried to divorce him She spent a lot of time away from the castle and wrote him angry letters

Late in life he suffered from depression and madness We do not know whether this was because he felt bad about being a murderer but he probably did feel guilty  He often made his servants hit him He also wrote very strange letters to a cardinal asking him to send him some of his dead uncles skeleton because he thought these remains would make him better

Gesualdo died alone at his castle The chapel where he was buried was destroyed by an earthquake in 1688 There is still a burial plaque in the rebuilt church

We think it is likely that Gesualdo felt terribly guilt all his life about the murders he had committed and these guilty feelings can be heard in his music The words of his madrigals are often very emotional they are about love pain death ecstasy agony Of course other madrigal composers used such words but Gesualdos music is really extreme It is often wildly chromatic Other composers did not copy his style

He wrote both sacred and secular songs and some music for instruments His most famous compositions are his six published books of madrigals as well as his Tenebrae Responsories which are very much like madrigals except that they use texts from the Passion story about Christs death on the cross

An Inspector Calls is a play written in 1945 by the British playwright J B Priestley but set in 1912 It was first performed in 1946 in two Moscow theatres as no London theatres were available It was then first produced in London at the New Theatre on 1 October 1946 It shows the way in which people are all connected and reflects Priestleys socialist views whilst outlining the problems he saw with capitalism 

Dramatic devices JB Priestley uses dramatic devices and dramatic irony to signal characters and introduce the inspector For example the house is pink and intimate while they are celebrating the engagement but when the sharp ring of a door bell the lighting changes to brighter and harder Some believe that it represents an interrogation room due to the bright lights that are shining on the Birlings as then the inspector come in and picks the story out of them bit by bit Dramatic Irony is used throughout the play to create prejudice between Mr Birling and the audience

The Justice and Equality Movement is a rebel group involved in the Darfur conflict of Sudan It is led by Khalil Ibrahim Together with other rebel groups such as the Sudan Liberation Army they are fighting against the government supported Janjaweed militia The JEM is also a member of the Eastern Front a rebel coalition After the Eastern Front signed a peace deal with the central government the JEM lost access to its funding from Eritrea

The JEM traces its foundation to the writers of the Black Book a manuscript published in 2000 that shows some problems JEM has an Islamist ideology and the government links the group to Hassan al Turabi although leaders of the group and Turabi himself deny the claim However al Turabi blames the government for making the situation worse

This article is about the constructed languages of J R R Tolkien used in his Middle earth universe

J R R Tolkien was a philologist and he was interested in language since he was a child He invented several languages which he then used in his Middle earth writings Aside from the external history most of his languages have also an invented internal history The internal history means how the languages evolved and were used inside the fictional story by the fictional people who spoke them Some of Tolkiens languages have a detailed grammar and vocabulary Other languages are not very detailed and some languages have only a few words and names Quenya and Sindarin are the best and most developed languages while others like Rohirric Khuzdl or Black Speech are not as much developed

Tolkien also created the Tengwar Sarati and Cirth scripts for his languages

The Eldarin languages or Elvish languages are the languages of the Elves At other times Elvish languages were the common speech Later the Elvish languages were also used by humans especially by scientists and the nobility The Eldarin languages can be divided into two groups Quenya language and Telerin languages

Quenya is an Elvish language It was spoken by the Vanyar and Noldor elves in Valinor When the Noldor returned to Middle earth in the First Age they brought Quenya with them But the native Sindarin became far more common in everyday speech In the Second Age and especially in the Third Age Quenya in Middle earth was used more as a scientific and ritual language Because of this Tolkien sometimes called Quenya the Elf Latin

Telerin is an Elvish language It was spoken by the Teleri elves From Telerin developed several new languages and dialects for example Sindarin

Sindarin is an Elvish language It came from the Telerin language It was spoken by the Sindar in Middle earth It later became the most common elvish language spoken in Middle earth

Adnaic is the language of the people of Nmenor After the Fall of Nmenor Adnaic was not often used anymore From Adnaic and the native languages of the western coastlands of Middle earth developed Westron

Rohirric is the language of the Rohirrim of Rohan In the books Rohirric text and names are always represented by Old English This is made because Rohirric should feel older but similar to the hobbits Westron and they are in the books represented by Old English and Modern English

Khuzdl is the language of the Dwarves The dwarves keep much of what they do a secret and they also do this with their language Because of this only a few place names and phrases are known from Khuzdl Dwarves have never told other people their Khuzdl names Instead they use other names when talking to the other peoples of Middle earth The dwarven nicknames that appear in the books are all taken from Norse mythology Besides the spoken language called aglab Khuzdl had the iglishmek which was a sign language

Entish is the language of the Ents The language is like the Ents themselves very unhasty it takes a lot of time to say something The language uses very long descriptions and many repetitions Because it is so complicated and takes so much time nobody but the Ents uses or can understand this language

Valarin was the language spoken by the Ainur

Black Speech is the language of Sauron The language was created by him and used by his followers The inscription on the One Ring was Black Speech written in tengwar Aside from the Ring inscription there are several names and words of Black Speech known

The set design for the entrance stage was at the north end of the stadium and consisted of another steel structure with various video screens hanging from it The steel beams for the structure were custom built in Belgium and shipped over to Orlando According to WWE Magazine the amount of pyrotechnics used would be ten times that of the amount used on Raw Without the restriction of a roof the pyrotechnics for the show shot as high as 2000 ft as compared to WrestleMania 23s height of 150 ft The fireworks were set off from boats on one of the lakes nearby the stadium WWE has been said to have spent an estimated 300000 on the fireworks alone After the show WWE was criticized for a malfunction in the pyrotechnics during The Undertakers victory celebration During the celebration a hot cable for pyrotechnics was sent flying into audience members in the upper seating bowl of the stadium leaving 45 injured with some hospitalized The accident was apparently due to a cable which fireworks were travelling across snapping thus resulting in the fireworks exploding into the top rows of the upper bowl of the stadium WWEs corporate website released a statement afterwards stating that they will investigate the incident

With the Citrus Bowls locker rooms on the south side and the entrance set on the north side a tented 40000 ft mini city outside the north end served as the shows backstage area and included air conditioning trailers VIP areas showers and restrooms As a consequence the road next to the north end zone W Church Street was closed down until a day after the event Numerous other roads were also closed to allow trucks and fork lifts to move in mega equipment for the event The ring itself was built on the 50 yard line of the Citrus Bowl to give the best view for fans Heavy duty plastic flooring had been put over the field to protect the turf provide seating and serve as the steel structures foundation

Development on the set design began in the middle of 2007 The building of the actual set began in the middle of March 100 people worked 16 hours a day to construct the set for the event The construction finished on March 29

The building was completed on 12 November 1897 with the name Folkets Hus The house functioned as one of the resorts for the then incipient labour movement of Copenhagen Since labour organisations were unpopular in the eyes of the authorities Years later the place helped poor people and was used for others uses In 1918 when workers stormed the Danish Stock Exchange In 1910 The Second International held an International Womens conference at the house during which Clara Zetkin launched the idea of an International Womens Day Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg visited the centre During the 1950s it was still primarily used by the different sections associations and unions of the labour movement All kinds of different activities took place for example boxing matches and end of season dances Several years later Brugsen a Danish chain of co operative supermarkets bought Folkets Hus for makin a cheap supermarket However as this was prohibited by authorities for the historic importance of the place so Brugsen sold the ground to the folk music ensemble Tingluti in 1978 The Tingluti sold the ground to the municipality of Copenhagen after few timeThe price at the time was DKK 700000 In 1982 Folkets Hus was assigned to a group of young people the original founders of Ungdomshuset however the municipality of Copenhagen still owned the building It was at this time that the building was given its current name Ungdomshuset Nick Cave and Bjrk played there In January 1996 Ungdomshuset was ravaged by a fire and found to be plagued by fungus and rot The municipality of Copenhagen made plans to renovate the building for safety reasons but encountered resistance from the occupants In 1999 the building was put on sale to the highest bidder by the municipality but same this time occupants opposed to the thing and for jocking put over the build a large banner with the message For sale along with 500 autonome stone throwing violent psychopaths from hell After that a company called Human AS bought the building in December 2000 after which Human AS was sold to the independent Christian sect Faderhuset However the squatters refused to leave the house Until 1 March 2007 the young squatters used the house as if the change of ownership had not happened and the new owners were not allowed inside at any time The Ungdomshuset received more than 500 visitors a week

Demolition of Ungdomshuset began at 800 am on 5 March 2007 The demolition was broadcast live by webcam on TV2 News website After the demolition of Ungdomshuset many riots began near the area for many days Many cars were smashed and burned against the police

A womens demonstration took place on 8 March comprising more than 3 000 people The police carried out systematic identity controls In total more than 750 people were arrested during the events On 16 March 2007 Danish police admitted to having mistakenly used a potentially lethal form of teargas The gas known as Ferret 40 was used against crowds during the riots following the demolition although it is designed to penetrate doors and walls 

According to professor Lars Dencik from the University of Roskilde the Danish state used the opportunity of this evacuation to test its anti terrorist security forces

A circuit board is a card made specially for attaching electronic components The board is made of a material that does not conduct electricity like fiberglass or plastic Parts are then attached to this base using a conductive bonding material This allows electricity to travel from one part to another which is essential for the board to work Inside the board between the layers of insulating material is copper for connecting the electricity between the electronic components Boards consist of many different parts which are all connected together in circuit and all perform a different task Circuit is the name for something which is looped The most common circuit boards are called PCBs and are most commonly mass produced ready for a specific job Some circuit boards are made plain and a person can build their own for certain electrical tasks they need done Most things that use electricity have at least one circuit board inside of them that makes them run

Printed circuit boards came from electrical connection systems that were used in the 1850s Originally metal strips or rods were used to connect large electric components mounted on wooden bases The metal strips were replaced by wires connected to screw terminals and wooden bases were replaced by metal frames Smaller designs were still due to the increased size and complexity of the circuits they were hoping to build In 1925 Charles Ducas of the United States submitted a patent application for a method of creating an electrical path directly on an insulated surface by printing through a stencil with electrically conductive inks This method gave birth to the name printed wiring or printed circuit

In 1943 Paul Eisler of the United Kingdom patented a method of etching the conductive pattern or circuits on a layer of copper foil bonded to a glass reinforced non conductive base Eislers technique was noticed by the US military and they started to use it in their new weapons in World War II His idea did not come in to commercial use until the 1950s when the transistor was introduced Up to that point the size of vacuum tubes and other components were so large that the traditional mounting and wiring methods were all that was needed With the introduction of transistors however the components became very small and manufacturers turned to printed circuit boards to reduce the overall size of the electronic package

Through hole technology and its use in multi layer PCBs were patented by the US firm Hazeltyne in 1961 The resulting increase in the complexity and detailed paths started a new era in PCB design Integrated circuit chips were introduced in the 1970s and these components were quickly incorporated into printed circuit board design and manufacturing techniques Today the Printed Circuit Board can have up to 8 layers in some applications

The main task in designing a PCB is figuring out where all the components are going to go Normally there is a design or schematic that will be turned into a PCB There is no such thing as a standard printed circuit board Each board is designed for its own use and must be the right size to fit the required space Board designers use computer aided design software to layout the circuit designs on the board The spaces between electrical paths are often 004 inches or smaller The location of the holes for component leads or contact points are also laid out Once the circuit pattern is laid out a negative image is printed out at exact size on a clear plastic sheet With a negative image the areas that are not part of the circuit pattern are shown in black and the circuit pattern is shown as clear This design is made into instructions for a computer controlled drilling machine or for the automatic solder paster used in the manufacturing process 

Many home made circuit boards are made with a light sensitive covering This covering is sometimes called photo resist The covering reacts with light Then the circuit board and covering are put in a developer Developer is a liquid that dissolves the covering that was exposed to light Then the board is put in an etchant An etchant dissolves the copper that is not covered by the covering Then the board is put into another liquid that removes the covering Some companies also use this method It is expensive per board but very cheap to set up in the beginning

Some professionally made circuit boards use a different method to remove extra copper from the circuit board A process called silk screening is used Silk screening is when a cloth is pulled tight over a frame Then an image is printed onto the cloth Then ink is pressed through the cloth The ink does not go where stuff has been printed on the cloth It is called silk screening because the cloth is usually silk The cloth is usually silk because it has very small holes silk screening is used to print an ink called resist onto the board Resist is an ink that resists the etchant used to make the circuit board Etchant dissolves the copper on the board This is cheaper for each board than photo resist but is more expensive in the beginning

Another way to make a circuit board is to use a mill A mill is a drill that moves in many directions The drill removes a small amount of copper each time it moves The mill removes the copper around the wires on the board This leaves extra copper on the board Other methods do not leave the extra copper on the board This method is cheaper per board but is expensive in the beginning It is also not commonly used in professionally made boards

Pans Labyrinth is an Academy Award winning Spanish language fantasy movie written and directed by Mexican movie maker Guillermo del Toro 

Pans Labyrinth takes place in two places known as a dual setting in the real world the story is set in Spain during the time period shortly after the Spanish Civil War and tells a story of a girl named Ofelia who is given three tasks by a mysterious faun Meanwhile her stepfather the Falangist Captain Vidal hunts the Spanish Maquis guerrillas who continued fighting the Franco regime in the region as her pregnant mother grows ill The alternate setting is a secret fantasy world that Ofelia enters through an overgrown labyrinth garden where she meets all manner of strange and magical creatures who become central to her story The movie uses make up puppetry and CGI effects to create its creatures

The director of this movie Del Toro said that he thinks the story to be a fable influenced by fairy tales and that it focuses on and continues themes related to his earlier movie The Devils Backbone a spiritual sequel though not an actual sequel The original Spanish title refers to the mythological fauns of Greek mythology while the English title refers specifically to the faun like Greek god Pan However Del Toro has stated that the faun in the movie is not Pan 

The movie was first shown at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival It was released in the United Kingdom on November 24 2006 In the United States and Canada the movie was given a limited release on December 29 2006 with a nationwide release on January 19 2007 Pans Labyrinth has won numerous international awards including three Academy Awards the Ariel Award for Best Picture and the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation Long Form

I noticed that tlresult was being added to closed RFDs I was wondering if we want to add the template to a closed RFD or leave it as is Oysterguitarist 2211 24 February 2008

On SE Wiktionary weve had some trouble with what we call the Kent State Vandal  a user or users from IP range 13112300  131123255255 which WHOIS shows as Kent State University Since were smaller there its a little more obvious but some digging here has unearthed the same user making the same types of vandalism Distinguishing features include quotes from Scrubs South Park Adam Sandler movies and other similar types of shows and movies as well as making edits regarding general dissatisfaction with the United States economy and president A lot of time and energy goes into reverting the vandalism from this range I would imagine most of us have blocked a few of the offending IPs An admin on SE Wiktionary contacted Kent State with no response so we recently did a few range blocks covering the main ranges of vandalism Id like to suggest doing so here as well Tygrrr 2035 26 February 2008

To give an example of edits

7 users in this range have been blocked in the last month with edits going back to November 2007 The user often stops just short of being blocked so the amount of time and energy spent on reversions not just blockings is much higher than what it shown in the block logs I would consider this to be long term abuse and thus think a long term soft block may be warranted Tygrrr 2120 26 February 2008

Ive only warned 3 users from this range in the past month This to me says that there isnt enough information honestly to warrant a range block at this time I think we should wait and see if more users from this range vandalize and if thats the case then we can consider a range block at that time This is just my thoughts on this Razorflame 2042 26 February 2008

Further update 1311230016 soft blocked for one year Tygrrr 2056 27 February 2008

I have noticed this range has been vandalising alot recently so I went through the block log and found the ips in the range of 2032080016 while doing this I had noticed that they were close to the IPs that me and Cometstyles have been blocking as open proxies which might explain this Going back further I noticed that this IPs from this range were being blocked close to the times that attack username where being created for admins and the JEW BOT names and going back even further I noticed that some of them were school IPs These go back to January 2005 I feel that a range block is needed here because the range has been vandalizing since 2005 most of the are probably open proxies and some of them have been blocked for long term vandalism What are your thoughts Oysterguitarist 0351 27 February 2008

Some of the blocked IPs on this range

Please remember to check CATUNBLOCK I checked there today and there were some that needed to be taken care of Oysterguitarist 0135 29 February 2008

All right I have been going over all of the users that I have warned throughout my time here at the Simple English Wikipedia and I noticed a trend with this IP Address range 82198250xxx is the range that I am talking about Almost every single address of this range has been warned at least once Some examples of how they edit can be found by checking out these addresses

are just some examples of the users that have been abusing their privledges here on the Simple English Wikipedia

Further investigation of the reversions made by administrators UserCreol UserBarliner and UserTygrrr have turned up another 15 addresses that have all been warned at least once Investigation of the block log has revealed that even though none of the addresses have been blocked the warnings given and the amount of addresses warned should prove long term abuse to this site

An investigation of each users contributions in the range 82198250xxx have revealed that almost 90 of these users have been warned at least once in the past Although I do not think that this is enough evidence to warrant a long term vandalism block I just wanted to bring it to peoples attention that I have found a trend in vandalism Thank you for reading this long message Razorflame 2057 29 February 2008

I dont mean any offense but I would really like to see a response to all my work that I put into this post  I want to know if it was appreciated and if I should do it again or I want to know if it is not something I should do again in the future Thanks Razorflame 1631 3 March 2008

This message that I am leaving here will touch base on a huge number of topics that I want to discuss here so I have added the inuse template to the topic of this page so that nobody will edit conflict me while I talk about the 15 issues that I am going to bring up to the AN Some of them dont fit here but since the majority of them did I decided to make this post here Please bear with me whilst I write an extremely long message Razorflame 1649 4 March 2008

The first issue that I would like to bring up is the fact that I think that it should only be administrators or bureaucrats that are able to close PGAPVGAPADs like in the RFA page This would provide some amount of control over what articles are allowed to become GAVGAs and what articles arent allowed to Razorflame 1649 4 March 2008

While I do commend the Simple English Wikipedia for getting 11 GAs in the past month I still wish that there were more GAs and VGAs Currently I think that if there were about 20 GAs and 10 VGAs that that would be a sufficient number of articles to have in each category I would therefore like to ask all editors here if they could please write some more articles that would be good possible GAVGAs in the future Thank you Razorflame 1649 4 March 2008

I am puzzled as to why there isnt a test1 or test4 template for removing content warning templates Obviously there should be as we use a 4 level warning system but for some reason they dont exist I hereby suggest that both of these templates should be created as soon as possible so that people who warn vandals can warn them better Razorflame 1649 4 March 2008

I am very disappointed that neither of these important jss work anymore I would like to take the time to ask that if there are any JavaScript people out there if they could correct both of these JavaScripts to make them work on the newest version of MediaWiki Thanks Razorflame 1649 4 March 2008

I am also very disappointed to see that there are people out there who would abuse the unblock tool This probably isnt that big of a deal as administrators can easily protect the page to prevent them from abusing the unblock tool but I think that we should stop it before it happens Those are just my two cents

Now to tackle the first big topic that I am going to bring up to the AN Lately I have been trying to devise ways of promoting ourselves so that we can get more active editors onto this site I came up with a few ideas

Both of these options are good choices and both of these I think would be beneficial to this site more than they would harm the site 

Alright thats one big topic down Razorflame 1649 4 March 2008

This reminds me of bug 12827 Oysterguitarist 0023 5 March 2008

The next big topic that I would like to bring to the administrators notice in particular is of this whole issue surrounding Benniguys latest unblock request The request can be found here People from around the site have been answering the call to this unblock request and now I believe that it is time that we provide a serious discussion about what is going to happen now Ben claims that he is on better medication and therefore is in better shape to be editing this Wikipedia He has posting up some very mature apologies and all of his answers on this page have been very mature I am in favor of letting him be unblocked but I still have some issues with Benniguy

Looking at some of my concerns above and reading some of the other peoples concerns at the unblock request page I would therefore like to propose that we vote for him to be unblocked now It has been about 15 weeks since Barliner proposed that we wait 2 weeks before voting for him to be unblocked and now I think it is time Razorflame 1649 4 March 2008

Excuse me Creol but I believe that your comments towards me above are unjust But I shall say no more on the matter as we are not discussing me As I have said a few times already I know it will be hard to believe me for alot of you because Ben is my Friend and I very well could be lying for all you know But I believe that here I am becoming a helpful and valuble editor to the team here and I would like to believe that you can trust me I can assure you that if I knew that Ben wanted to come back with ill intention then I would cast my vote for him to stay blocked because I am now into reverting vandilism and if ben came back and played up I would have to be one of the users here to help set things strait again  and I really would rather that not be done Getting onto Bens treatment He had been on a waiting list for about a year to recieve this treatment and has finnally been put through to recieving it and I am grateful to the lord that it is having a posative effect on him althpough it did not have an effect for the first week or so it is all in full swing now At school he has been cheerful and enthusistic as well as persistantly hard working in the classes I take with him He has also been quite the perfectionist  being hard on himself when he gets questions wrong or doesnt understand something He seems to take more time and care over his work and his mood swings havnt been seen at any time infact he goes to school all five days a week now which used to be quite the achievement before I have been told that I should not participate in this vote  so you dont have to worry about me swinging the vote in Bens favor But to be honest Im neutral in this vote anyway it wont really make a difference to me either way because Im just here to edit now Thank you I hope you take on board all that I say but i completely understand if you choose toignore what I have said because of my closeness to the situation But as the only one who knows ben in real life I have to say that I have seen a dramtic change in him for the better since the beginning of his treatment Ben tells me that he will be scanning his medical certificate of treatment into the computer and uploading onto commons for those who are not nsure about wheather or not they belive him about his treatment Thnank You again IuseRosary 1638 5 March 2008

He said he doesnt mind but ill pass the message that you dont think its a good idea the certificate doensnt have to many details just his name DOB and aload of medical mumbo jumbo IuseRosary 1915 5 March 2008

I would like to ask administrators if they think that we should be protecting high risk templates like enWP does Do any of the current administrators here support this idea If thats the case then the following is a list of templates that I think should be protected because they are high risk templates

If you think up of any more templates that you think need to be protected feel free to add them to the list Razorflame 1649 4 March 2008

There are several users that have been fairly inactive from this Wikipedia that I would like to propose that we remove their permissions due to inactivity

Even though this user has been fairly active on this Wikipedia however the last checkuser thing he did was back in November of last year I would therefore like to request that he be put up for removal of his Checkuser status due to inactivity Razorflame 1649 4 March 2008

Following up on the last post I would therefore if the community decides to demote M7 to nominate Tygrrr to succeed him Tygrrr is much more active on this Wikipedia than M7 and therefore I think he would be a better choice for Checkuser Razorflame 1649 4 March 2008

Blockinblox even though he has done a great job of being a bureaucrat in the past has not been very active recently Even though he does have some amount of activity the last time that he did any bureaucrat work was back in November of last year I would therefore like to propose to the community that he is replaced with someone more active Razorflame 1649 4 March 2008

Following up on the last post I would therefore if the community decides to demote Blockinblox from bureaucrat to nominate Creol to succeed him Creol is much more active has done many great things for this Wikipedia and is a very very very good candidate for becoming a bureaucrat I would therefore like to say that Creol is a better choice for a bureaucrat Razorflame 1649 4 March 2008

Finally I would like to suggest to the community that both of these sysops be desysopped from this Wikipedia due to inactivity Both have done no edits since late 2006 which is just ridiculous Just having them retain their sysop status would endanger us if a hacker got into their accounts Razorflame 1649 4 March 2008

I am sorry for bringing this up but I just have to bring this up I disapprove of anyone that is banned on the regular English Wikipedia from coming here to edit I see of it as though we are both a testing grounds for banned users to rejoin the regular English Wikipedias community afterwords and as a way for those banned users to evade their ban I am sick and tired of all the stress that it has caused our community in the past and I want to prevent this from happening in the future I would therefore like to suggest to this Wikipedia that all banned accounts from enWP that create accounts here get blocked for the reasons that I have stated above I would like to also ask all the administrators on here to talk in detail about this problem as I believe that it is one that needs to be fixed Cheers Razorflame 1649 4 March 2008

The Swiss Federal Council is the group of seven people who are the federal government of Switzerland As Switzerland does not have one person as President the Federal Council is also the head of state 

The whole council is responsible for leading the federal administration of Switzerland but each Councillor runs one of the seven federal ministries The current members of the Federal Council for 2011 are

The Federal Council was set up by the 1848 Federal Constitution as the supreme executive and directorial authority of the Confederation 

When the Constitution was written constitutional democracy was still in its infancy and the founding fathers of Switzerland had little in the way of examples Switzerland has a long tradition of being governed by a council of representatives instead of one powerful ruler so while they drew heavily on the US Constitution for the organisation of the federal state as a whole they opted for the council rather than the presidential system for the executive branch of government 

Today only three other states Andorra Bosnia and Herzegovina and San Marino have more than one person act as head of state at a time The collegial system of government is often used for government Many countries have a form of cabinet government with collective responsibility

After the 1959 elections a Zauberformel or magical formula was invented The formula works out how many members of the Federal Council each political party has and showed that the Federal Council is always a voluntary grand coalition 

Based on their strengths in the Federal Assembly the seats were distributed as follows

The FDP and CVP have been getting less popular and more people have supported the SVP and SPS After the 2003 elections the SVP asked for a CVP Council seat for their leader Christoph Blocher and threatened to otherwise leave the government After the 2007 elections Blocher was replaced by another member of the CVP so the strength of the parties is still

Women did not get the federal vote until 1971 The first woman to be an official candidate was Lilian Uchtenhagen in 1983

In total only six out of 109 Councillors have been women

Each year one of the seven Councillors is elected by the Federal Assembly as President of the Confederation The Federal Assembly also elects a Vice President By convention the positions of President and Vice President rotate annually each Councillor thus becoming Vice President and then President every seven years while in office The same person cannot be President two years in a row or be elected Vice President in the years after he has been President

According to the Swiss order of precedence the President of the Confederation is the highest ranking Swiss official He or she presides over Council meetings and carries out certain representative functions that in other countries are the business of the Head of State In urgent situations where a Council decision cannot be made in time he or she is empowered to act on behalf of the whole Council Apart from that though he or she is a primus inter pares having no power above and beyond the other six Councillors

The President is not the Swiss head of state this function is carried out by the Council acting together However the President acts and is recognized as head of state while conducting official visits abroad as the members of the Council never leave the country at the same time More often though official visits abroad are carried out by the head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs Visiting heads of state are received by all the Federal Council together

The Federal Council meets each Wednesday at the Bundeshaus in Bern the seat of the Swiss federal government 

Apart from the seven Councillors the following officials also attend the meetings

After the meetings the Councillors always take lunch together The Council also meets regularly in broken wikt linkConclaveconclave to discuss important topics at length and annually conducts what is colloquially referred to as its school excursion a day trip to some attractions in the Presidents home canton In that and other respects the Council operates not unlike a board of directors of a major corporation

Each Federal Councillor heads a government department much like the ministers in the governments of other countries Colloquially and by the press they are often referred to as ministers For example the head of the Federal Department of Defence Civil Protection and Sportsis often called the minister of defence However as Council members they are not only responsible for their own department but also for the business of their colleagues departments as well and for the conduct of the government and the federal administration as a whole

The meetings of the Federal Council and the result of the votes taken are not open to the public and the records remain sealed for 50 years This has lately been the subject of some criticism In particular the parties at the ends of the political spectrum argue that this secrecy is contrary to the principle of transparency However the Council has always said that secrecy is necessary to reach consensus and to preserve the collegiality and political independence of the individual Councillors

Despite the secrecy rule details of the votes and the arguments in Council are sometimes leaked to the press resulting in investigations and criminal prosecutions of the leaking staff member

Due to the Federal Councils unique nature as a voluntary grand coalition of political opponents its operation is subject to numerous constitutional conventions Most notable is the principle of collegiality that is the Councillors are supposed not to publicly criticise one another even though they are often political opponents In effect they are expected to publicly support all decisions of the Council even against their own personal opinion or that of their political party In the eye of many observers this convention has become rather strained after the 2003 elections

The members of the Federal Council are elected for a term of four years by both chambers of the federal parliament sitting together as the Federal Assembly Each Councillor is elected individually by secret ballot by an absolute majority of votes Every adult Swiss citizen is eligible but in practice only Members of Parliament or more rarely members of Cantonal governments are nominated by the political parties and receive a substantial amount of votes The voting is conducted in several rounds in the first two rounds anyone can enter their name but in subsequent rounds the person receiving the least votes is removed from the race until one candidate gains an absolute majority

With Council seats allocated to parties by unwritten agreement Federal Council elections generally are unexciting pleasant affairs Usually the party which has a seat to fill presents two candidates with mainstream viewpoints to the United Federal Assembly which then chooses one This was not so however during the 2003 election which was the most controversial in recent memory

Once elected Councillors remain members of their political parties but hold no leading office with them In fact they usually maintain a certain political distance from the party leadership because under the rules of collegiality they will often have to publicly promote a Council decision which does not match the political conviction of their party

Once elected for a four year term Federal Councillors can neither be voted out of office by a motion of no confidence nor can they be impeached Re election is possible for an indefinite number of terms and it has historically been extremely rare for Parliament not to re elect a sitting Councillor This has only happened four times  to Ulrich Ochsenbein in 1854 to Jean Jacques Challet Venel in 1872 to Ruth Metzler Arnold in 2003 and to Christoph Blocher in 2007 In practice therefore Councillors serve until they decide to resign and retire to private life usually after three to five terms of office

Unlike most senior members of government in other countries the Federal Councillors are not entitled to an official residence Mostly they have chosen to rent apartments or hotel suites in Bern the only contemporary exception being Moritz Leuenberger who daily commutes by train from Zrich to Bern However they are entitled to use the Federal Councils country estate Lohn for holidays this estate is also used to host official guests of the Swiss Confederation 

Councillors can have an Army security detail if they need personal protection But often one can meet them without any escort at all in the streets restaurants and tramways of Bern Councillors are also entitled to a personal bailiff who accompanies them in a colourful uniform to official events This tradition goes back through the republican governments of the ancient Swiss cantons right back to the lictors of the ancient Roman Republic

The spouses of Councillors do not play an official part in the business of government apart from accompanying the Councillors to official receptions

Federal Councillors draw a yearly remuneration of about CHF 400000 After completing a full term of office they are entitled to a perennial yearly pension of half that amount after leaving office

While Councillors are forbidden by law to hold any other post during their term of office it is not unusual for them to accept lucrative business engagements after leaving office eg on the board of directors of major Swiss corporations

Federal Councillors like Members of Parliament enjoy absolute legal immunity for all statements made in their official capacity

For crimes not relating to their official capacity they can be prosecuted only with the permission of the Federal Council as a whole while in office The prosecutor can appeal a refusal to grant permission to the Federal Assembly 

Prosecution for crimes and misdemeanors that do relate to the Councillors official capacity requires the assent of the Federal Assembly In such cases Parliament can also suspend the Councillor in office

According to statements to the media by a Federal Chancellory official in none of the few cases of accusations against a Federal Councillor has the permission to prosecute ever been granted Such cases usually involved statements considered offensive by members of the public However one unnamed Councillor involved in a traffic accident immediately prior to his date of resignation was reported to have voluntarily waived his immunity and Councillor Elisabeth Kopp decided to resign upon facing an inquiry over allegations of secrecy violations

Historically the collegial government of Switzerland has been assessed both internationally and nationally as exceptionally competent and stable The Federal Council as a whole has consistently maintained public approval and confidence rates in excess of sixty percent possibly also because under the Swiss system of direct democracy voters can vent their displeasure with government decisions when deciding individual issues at the ballot box

However lately there has been a growing contention that the Federal Council is often too slow to respond to the needs of the moment too resistant to change and too weak to lead the powerful federal bureaucracy Various changes have been proposed to address these issues including expanding the powers of the presidency expanding the Federal Council itself or adding a second layer of ministers between the Council and the departments None of these proposals has yet borne fruit however

Ertls research laid the foundation of modern surface chemistry which has helped explain how fuel cells produce energy without pollution how catalytic converters clean up car exhausts and even why iron rusts the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said 

His work has paved the way for development of cleaner energy sources and will guide the development of fuel cells said Astrid Graslund secretary of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry 

The Nobel academy said Ertl provided a detailed description of how chemical reactions take place on surfaces His findings applied in both academic studies and industrial development the academy said Surface chemistry can even explain the destruction of the ozone layer as vital steps in the reaction actually take place on the surfaces of small crystals of ice in the stratosphere the award citation reads 

Ertl and his wife Barbara have two children and several grandchildren His hobbies include playing the piano and also playing with his cats

Professor Ertl is an editor of the Handbook of Heterogeneous Catalysis

Professor Ertl studied physics at the Technical University of Stuttgart from 1955 to 1957 He studied at the University of Paris from 1957 to 1958 and then at Ludwig Maximillians University in Munich from 1958 to 1959 He returned to the Technical University of Stuttgart where he got a diplom of physics in 1961 Then he studied at the Technical University of Munich and got a PhD in 1965

After getting his PhD he stayed in Munich as an assistant and a lecturer between 1965 and 1968 Then he moved to the Technical University of Hannover where he worked as Professor and Director from 1968 to 1973 In 1973 Professor Ertl returned to the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich to work as a professor at the Institute of Physical Chemistry He worked there until 1986 and during this time was a regular visitor to the California Institute of Technology the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee and the University of California in Berkeley where he worked as a visiting professor In 1986 he became professor at the Free University of Berlin and the Technical University of Berlin He was director at the Fritz Haber Institute of the MPG from 1986 and was also a professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin from 1996 Professor Ertl retired in 2004

Professor Ertl studied the broken wikt linkmoleculemolecules of ammonia iron carbon monoxide and palladium to help make modern catalytic converters He studied platinum to learn about its atoms

Professor Ertl helped to develop new ways of using microscopes One was called low energy electron diffraction used at the beginning of his career and later he worked on ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscope

Professor Ertl and Gabor A Somorjai won the Wolf Prize for Chemistry in 1998 for outstanding results in surface science and for discovering how crystals react to experiments 

Professor Ertl was awarded the Nobel prize for chemistry in 2007 for more studies of surface science

John William Waterhouse was an English painter in the Pre Raphaelite style He worked after the breakup of the Pre Raphaelite Brotherhood and so was called the modern Pre Raphaelite He was also influenced by his contemporaries the Impressionists His artworks were known for their depictions of women from both ancient Greek mythology and Arthurian legend

Born in Italy to English parents who were both painters he later moved to London where he enrolled in the Royal Academy of Art He soon began exhibiting at their annual summer exhibitions focusing on the creation of large canvas works depicting scenes from the daily life and mythology of ancient Greece Later on in his career he came to embrace the Pre Raphaelite style of painting despite the fact that it had gone out of fashion in the British art scene several decades before 

Although not as well known as earlier Pre Raphaelite artists such as Dante Rossetti John Millais and William Holman Hunt Waterhouses work is currently displayed at several major British art galleries and the Royal Academy of Art organised a major retrospective of his work in 2009

The Semantic Web is a project of the W3C that uses metadata to let computers understand the information on the internet This would make computers able to do more of the work involved in finding sharing and combining information on the internet

The Semantic Web is an idea of the inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners Lee He wants to make the web more intuitive about how to meet a users needs The semantics of information and services is defined in Web Ontology Language and RDF Schemas These are used to give a formal description of concepts terms and relationships within a given area of knowledge

Tim Berners Lees Idea was as follows

The World Wide Web is based on HTML documents The semantic web involves using Resource description Framework that has data that computers use The layout used in HTML will be stored separately such as in a CSS file RDF and OWL can either supplement or replace the content of web documents

In this way a machine can use the knowledge itself By using the information in ways similar to human reasoning it can create more meaningful results

Hypersonic speeds are speeds that are highly supersonic

Hypersonic can be any of the following

In aerodynamics hypersonic speeds are speeds that are highly supersonic The word hypersonic came from a word used in the 1970s Mach 5 or 5 times the speed of sound Everything about the plane changes greatly when the airplane that is flying at those speeds reaches supersonic speeds 

Though the definition for hypersonic speeds is not very clear and is a subject of debate among scientists they have come up with a possible definition A hypersonic flow may be characterized by certain things that can no longer be discounted in analysis Some of these things include

As the plane goes faster and mach numbers increase the density behind the shock also goes up This happens in concert with a decrease in volume behind the shock wave because of the conservation of mass theory Because of this the shock layer is thin at high mach numbers

As a plane goes faster and mach numbers go up the entropy change across the shock also goes up This results in a strong entropy gradient and highly vortical flow that mixes with the boundary layer

Some of the big kinetic energy found with flow at large mach numbers becomes internal energy in the fluid because of viscosity The increase in internal energy makes the temperature go up Because the pressure gradient normal to the flow within a boundary layer is zero the increase of temperature through the boundary layer causes the density to fall This causes the boundary layer over the body of the airplane to grow This in turn causes the temperature to go up

Hurwicz works as Regents Professor of Economics at the University of Minnesota Professor Hurwicz believes that game theory is very important Hurwicz shared the 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Eric Maskin and Roger Myerson for their work on ways mechanism design

Professor Hurwicz was born in Moscow Russia to a Jewish family a few months before the October Revolution His family is Polish and had lived in Congress Kingdom but they moved to Russia to escape World War I Soon after Professor Hurwicz was born the family returned to Warsaw in Poland Hurwicz and his family were treated very badly by the Bolsheviks and Nazis because they were Jewish He became a refugee again when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939 His parents and brother ran away to Warsaw where they were arrested by the Soviets and sent to labor camps Hurwicz was forced to move to Switzerland then to Portugal and finally in 1940 he moved to the United States His family joined him there after some time

Hurwicz hired Evelyn Jensen to help him teach during the 1940s She grew up on a Wisconsin farm and was studying economics at the University of Chicago Leonid and Evelyn got married in 1944 and later lived on the Mississippi River parkway in Minneapolis Minnesota They have four children called Sarah Michael Ruth and Maxim 

He has interests in linguistics archaeology biochemistry and music He has researched for meteorology and is a member of the National Science Foundation department for trying to control the weather When Eugene McCarthy ran for president of the United States Hurwicz was a Minnesota delegate to the Democratic Party Convention and a member of the Democratic Party Platform Committee

Professor Hurwiczs father wanted him to study law and he did In 1938 Hurwicz got a degree from Warsaw University He enjoyed studying in economics class and went to the London School of Economics with Nicholas Kaldor and Friedrich Hayek In 1939 he moved to Geneva where he studied at the Graduate Institute of International Studies and studied Ludwig von Mises teaching After moving to the United States he studied more economics at Harvard University and the University of Chicago Professor Hurwicz does not have a degree in economics but he won the Nobel prize for economics in 2007 He said Whatever economics I learned I learned by listening and learning

In 1941 Hurwicz was helping Paul Samuelson to teach at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and helping Oskar Lange to teach at the University of Chicago At Illinois Institute of Technology during the war Hurwicz taught electronics to the US Army Signal Corps Then from 1942 to 1944 at the University of Chicago he was a member of the faculty of the Institute of Meteorology and taught statistics in the Department of Economics His advisors in 1942 were Jacob Marschak and Tjalling Koopmans of the University of Chicago who now work for the Cowles Foundation at Yale University

Hurwicz received a Guggenheim Fellowship for 19451946 In 1946 he became a professor of economics at Iowa State College From January 1942 until June 1946 he was a researcher for the Cowles Commission He worked full time for the Cowles Commission until October 1950 until January 1951 he was a visiting professor teaching at classes that were taught before by Professor Koopman in the Department of Economics and he was a very important professor there He was also a research professor of economics and statistics at the University of Illinois a consultant to the RAND Corporation for the University of Chicago and a consultant to the US government Hurwicz continued to be a consultant to the Cowles Commission until about 1961

Hurwicz was given a job by Walter Heller at the University of Minnesota in 1951 where he became a professor of economics and mathematics in the School of Business Administration Most of his work for the rest of his life was in Minnesota but he studied and was a teacher elsewhere in the United States and Asia In 1955 and again in 1958 Hurwicz was a visiting professor and a fellow on the second visit at Stanford University and there in 1959 he published Optimality and Informational Efficiency in Resource Allocation Processes on making rules for buyers and sellers and governments share wealth He taught at Bangalore University in 1965 and during the 1980s at Tokyo University Peoples University and the University of Indonesia In the United States he was a visiting professor at Harvard in 1969 at the University of California Berkeley in 1976 at Northwestern University twice in 1988 and 1989 at the University of California Santa Barbara in 1998 the California Institute of Technology in 1999 and the University of Michigan in 2002 He was a visiting Distinguished Professor at the University of Illinois in 2001

In the University of Minnesota in 1961 Hurwicz became chairman of the Statistics Department Regents Professor of Economics in 1969 and Curtis L Carlson Regents Professor of Economics in 1989 He taught subjects ranging from theory to welfare economics public economics rules for large companies and mathematical economics Although he retired from full time teaching in 1988 Hurwicz taught graduate school as Professor Emeritus in the autumn of 2006 In 2007 his ongoing research was described by the University of Minnesota as comparison and analysis of systems and techniques of economic organization welfare economics game theoretic implementation of social choice goals and modeling economic institutions Professor Hurwiczs published works in these fields date back to 1944 Professor Hurwicz is known internationally for his good work researching economic theory specially with rules for big businesses and governments using mathematical economics In the 1950s he worked with Kenneth Arrow on non linear programming Kenneth Arrow became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Economics prize in 1972 Hurwicz helped Daniel McFadden who won a Nobel prize in 2000 

Hurwiczs work was important to help show how large economic systems should be studied Some of these systems are capitalism and socialism Professor Hurwiczs ideas of how to share wealth are also very important The theory of incentive compatibility that Hurwicz developed changed the way many economists think about sharing in the future explaining why centrally planned economies may fail and how rewards for certain people make a difference when making decisions

A virtual private network or VPN for short is a way of connecting two computers through a network Most people using computers connect to the World Wide Web using a normal network  they use dial up or broadband VPN is a little bit different it is used by some workers to connect using a laptop to do work  they can check their work email and see work websites which can not be seen on the normal internet

Dial up internet access usually just called Dial up is a slow way of connecting to the Internet by using a telephone line A modem is connected between a computer and a telephone line and then the modem is instructed to dial the phone number of an Internet service provider to connect to the Internet The ISP must be a dial up service provider with several dial up modems waiting to accept dial up calls This kind of internet is slower than DSL It is not widely used in the United States where only one out of every ten people still use it

iPass is a company that lets business users connect to the Internet when they are not in work or even on holiday A laptop is usually used and can be used to connect from another city or country or even when at home

The main benefit of iPass is that a single account can be used without setup almost anywhere in the world It is possible to do the same thing by signing up for local services but this can be quite hard to do But it is not free to use and it is usually expensive compared to normal internet connections

The offices are in two parts which face each other across a cortyard One end opens onto the town square and the other opens onto the River Arno Varsari designed a sort of screen like a backdrop in an Ancient Greek theatre It has arches through which the view of the river can be seen 

Duke Cosimo had a plan to arrange that finest works of art in the Medici families collections on the upper floor This was not done until the time of Francesco I He also commissioned Buontalenti to design the most the famous room in the Uffizi an octagonal room called the Tribune of the Uffizi This room contained many of the best paintings Rich people would often send their sons on a Grand Tour of Europe The Tribune of the Uffizi was one of the important sights on the tour At first people could only see the gallery by request The last Medici heiress Anna Maria Lodovica made an agreement with the city of Florence In 1765 the Uffizi Gallery was officially opened to the public

Mosaic is the art of decorating a surface with pictures and patterns made of little pieces of stone glass or tiles of different colours Mosaics can be used indoors on walls floors and ceilings Mosaics are sometimes used outdoors on pavements 

Making mosaics Mosaics are made by setting coloured pieces into mortar which sets hard and holds the pieces in place Some mosaics are made of round pebbles and have only two or three colours Other mosaics are made of marble Many mosaics particularly in Italy are made of terracotta tiles Terracotta tiles come in many colours and can be used for colourful pictures as well as patterns 

Some tiles look as if they are made of pure gold These tiles are actually made of glass and have a very thin leaf of gold stuck to one side The side with the gold gets put into the mortar Then the gold can be seen through the glass but cannot be scratched off

Mosaics often last for a very long time There are still plenty of mosaics which were made by the Ancient Romans They can be seen in Italy England France as well as other countries that were once part of the Roman Empire 

Many beautiful mosaics date from the Early Christian and Byzantine eras from about 300 AD to 1400 in Italy Greeceand other countries The mosaics in churches usually have pictures which tell Bible stories

Mosaics were a popular way to decorate churches in Italy in the Medieval period They were not popular in England France Germany and countries of Northern Europe because they preferred to use stained glass windows as decoration In Italy the most famous church with its interior decorated with mosaics is St Marks Basilica Venice At Westminster Cathedral in London the mosaic decoration which was started more than 100 years ago is still continuing bit by bit Many of the mosaics at St Marks and Westminster Cathedral have gold backgrounds 

Nowadays mosaics are still used in all sorts of ways Mosaics are most often used to brighten up public places in cities Modern mosaics are made of all sorts of materials mosaic tiles bathroom tiles broken roof tiles broken dishes broken mirrors bits of metal and old bricks

Odilon Redon was a Symbolist painter and printmaker born in Bordeaux Aquitaine France

Redon started drawing as a young child and at the age of 10 he was given a drawing prize at school At age 15 he began official study in drawing but he later on switched to architecture because his father told him to His failure to pass the entrance exams at Paris cole des Beaux Arts ended any plans for a career as an architect although he would later study there under Jean Lon Germe

Back home in his home town of Bordeaux he took up sculpture and Rodolphe Bresdin instructed him in etching and lithography However his artistic career was halted in 1870 when he joined the army to serve in the Franco Prussian War

At the end of the war he moved to Paris working almost only in charcoal and lithography It would not be until 1878 that his work gained any recognition with Guardian Spirit of the Waters and he published his first album of lithographs called Dans le Rve in 1879 Still Redon remained unknown until the appearance in 1884 of a cult novel by Joris Karl Huysmans titled rebours The story featured a decadent aristocrat who collected Redons drawings 

In the 1890s he began to use pastel and oils which featured in most of his works for the rest of his life In 1899 he exhibited with the Nabis at Durand Ruels In 1903 he was given the Legion of Honor His popularity increased when a catalogue of etchings and lithographs was published by Andr Mellerio in 1913 and that same year he was given the largest single representation at the New York Armory Show 

In 2005 the Museum of Modern Art launched an exhibition called Beyond The Visible a comprehensive overview of Redons work showcasing more than 100 paintings drawings prints and books from The Ian Woodner Family Collection The exhibition ran from October 30 2005 to January 23 2006

Pinnipeds are a group of semi aquatic marine mammals the seals and their relatives The Pinnipedia is in the Order Carnivora There are three Pinniped families Odobenidae Otariidae and Phocidae So seals and walruses are both pinnipeds 

Pinnipeds are typically sleek bodied and barrel shaped Their bodies are well adapted to the aquatic habitat where they spend most of their lives Pinnipeds have flippers for hands big bulky bodies doggish faces and big eyes Unlike cetaceans pinnipeds have their noses on their face and each nostril of the nose closes when the pinniped goes under water Like cetaceans pinnipeds have a thick layer of blubber just under their skin this blubber keeps them warm in cold waters and keeps them fed during times when food is not easily found When they cannot find food they live off the fat in the blubber

Pinnipeds are carnivorous This means they eat only meat and not plants However almost all pinnipeds can be eaten by sharks or orca whales

Pinnipeds are often trained in zoos or aquariums to put on shows but in Sweden it is illegal to train a seal to balance a ball on its nose

The Trojan asteroids are asteroids which orbit round the Sun in the same orbit and time as a planet

The largest group of asteroids known to move around the Sun are those with the planet Jupiter There are two groups of Jovian Trojans one group on each side of Jupiter 

In 1772 the French mathematician and astronomer Joseph Louis Lagrange identified two spots in a planets orbit which were gravitationally stable If put there an object would stay there Lagrange predicted the existence of a group of small bodies in each of the two stable points in Jupiters orbit 

The term originally referred to the Trojan asteroids orbiting around Jupiters Lagrangian points which are by convention named after figures from the Trojan War of Greek mythology By convention the asteroids orbiting Jupiters L4 point are named after the heroes from the Greek side of the war while those at L5 are from the Trojan side The two exceptions the Greek themed 617 Patroclus and the Trojan themed 624 Hektor were actually assigned to the wrong sides

In 1904 Edward Emerson Barnard was the first person to see a Trojan asteroid Barnard thought it was a moon of the planet Saturn In February 1906 a German astronomer named Max Wolf saw a Trojan asteroid and named it 588 Achilles Wolf was the first person to see a Trojan asteroid and know what it was Since that time more than 2000 Trojan asteroids have been seen The biggest Trojan asteroid is named 624 Hektor 624 Hektor is 370 km across Astronomers think that Trojan asteroids are made of ice and dust 

Later objects were found orbiting the Lagrangian points of Neptune Mars and Earth Asteroids at the Lagrangian points of planets other than Jupiter may be called Lagrangian asteroids

Astronomers have found a Trojan asteroid not far from Earth moving in the same orbit around the Sun It sits in one of the Lagrange points which are 60 degrees ahead of or behind the planets in their orbits These are points of gravitational stability

Called 2010 TK7 the rock is about 80 million km from Earth and should come no closer than about 25 million km The team says its orbit appears stable at least for the next 10000 years

It took an orbiting telescope sensitive to infrared light to pick up 2010 TK7 Wise the Wide field Infrared Survey Explorer launched in 2009 examined more than 500 Near Earth objects 123 of which were new to science Follow up work on the Canada France Hawaii Telescope confirmed the status of 2010 TK7refAmos Jonathan 2011 Trojan asteroid seen in Earths orbit by Wise telescope BBC Science News ref

Aquaman is a fictional comic book superhero published by DC Comics Aquaman was created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger and first appeared in More Fun Comics 72 in November 1941

During the Silver Age of Comic Books Aquaman was a founding member of the Justice League of America

Aquamans biography and origin has been reinvented several times since 1941

Aquaman has several superhuman powers He can breathe underwater and swim at very high speeds Aquaman has super strength and is very hard to injure

Green Lantern is the name of several fictional superheroes that appear in comic books published by DC Comics 

The first was Alan Scott and was created by writer Bill Finger and artist Martin Nodell in All American Comics 16 in July 1940

The most famous is Hal Jordan and was created by John Broome and Gil Kane in Showcase 22 in October 1959

Each Green Lantern wears a power ring that allows the Green Lantern to control the physical world by strength of will

Alan Scott was the Golden Age Green Lantern and his ring was powered by magic

All of the Green Lanterns since then have worn rings that were not magic but advanced technology The Guardians of the Universe created the power rings and granted them to worthy candidates throughout the galaxy These individuals make up the Green Lantern Corps an intergalactic police force

Alan Scott was a young engineer when he found a metal lantern that glowed with a magical green flame The flame told Alan how to build a ring Alan used the power of the ring to fight crime Alan was a founding member of the Justice Society of America

Alan Scotts power ring had to be recharged every 24 hours and did not work on wood

Hal Jordan was an airplane test pilot Jordan was given his power ring by a dying alien named Abin Sur whose spaceship had crashed on Earth Jordan was a founding member of the Justice League of America and also a member of the Green Lantern Corps

Hal Jordans ring initially did not work on anything the color yellow

Hal Jordans hometown Coast City was destroyed in the early 1990s and he went insane Jordan destroyed the Green Lantern Corps and renamed himself Parallax Jordan later died sacrificing himself to reignite a dying Sun only to return from the grave as the Spectre the divine Spirit of Gods Vengeance

Hal Jordan was eventually revived and once again became a Green Lantern He also made an oath to recharge the power ring In brightest day in blackest night No evil shall escape my sight Let those who worship evils might Beware my powerGreen lanterns light

Guy Gardner

Guy Gardner was the second choice of Abin Sur and the backup to Hal Jordan

John Stewart

John Stewart an architect was chosen by the Guardians to replace Guy Gardner as the backup Green Lantern for Hal Jordan

Kyle Rayner

August Kopff was a German astronomer who found many comets and asteroids

He found some comets such as the periodic comet 22PKopff and the non periodic C1906 E1

He found many asteroids such as the notable Trojan asteroids 617 Patroclus and 624 Hektor

A crater on the Moon is named after him see Kopff

Great Yarmouth often known to locals as Yarmouth is an English coastal town in Norfolk It is situated at the mouth of the River Yare

Even though later astronomers tried to find it again it has not been reliably seen since Notably an imaging sequence covering an entire orbital period at 4 km resolution taken on 15 November 2004 failed to find the object This suggests that it was a clump of material that had disappeared by that time

Another object S2004 S 4 was seen nearby 5 hours later but this time just inside the F Ring Because of the different location of the second object it was given a fresh designation although their interpretation as a single object on a F ring crossing orbit is also possible Such an object might also be orbiting at a bit different inclination to the F ring thereby not actually passing through the ring material even though it was being seen both radially inward and outward of it

If a solid object after all S2004 S 3 would be 35 km in diameter based on brightness and might be a shepherd satellite for the farther edge of Saturns F ring

Even though astronomers tried to find it again it has not been reliably seen since Notably an imaging sequence covering an entire orbital period at 4 km resolution taken on 15 November 2004 failed to find the object This suggests that it was a clump of material that had disappeared by that time

An interpretation where S3 and S4 are or were a single object on a F ring crossing orbit is also possible Such an object might also be orbiting at a bit different inclination to the F ring thereby not actually passing through the ring material even though it was being seen both radially inward and outward of it

If a solid object after all S2004 S 4 would be 35 km in diameter based on brightness 

It was first seen by scientists in pictures taken by the Cassini Huygens probe on October 28 2004 and announced on 8 November that year It appears to be the best tracked object in this area with at least five possible sightings in the period till late 2005 In comparison two objects in the F rings area that were first seen months earlier have not been found again with any confidence Nevertheless it continues to be unclear whether there is a solid core to S2004 S 6 or whether it is just a dust clump that will disappear in years or months Notably an imaging sequence covering an entire orbital period at 4 km resolution taken on 15 November 2004 failed to find the object while it has been seen again later The lighting conditions in S2004 S 6s part of the orbit were different during these two sightings however with the discovery being made when the area was strongly backlit by the sun A suggested resolution of the absence in November is that S2004 S 6s visibility is primarily due to a diffuse cloud of fine dust that is much brighter in forward scattered light and that the solid core is small

The dusty halo seen in pictures is big being around 2000 km in lengthwise extent The solid object if any would be no bigger than 35 km in diameter based on brightness

Joel Hastings Metcalf was an American astronomer

Metcalf graduated from Harvard Divinity School in 1892 He served as a Unitarian minister in Burlington Vermont and then later in Taunton Massachusetts Winchester Massachusetts and Portland Maine

He found or co found many comets such as 23PBrorsen Metcalf and 97PMetcalf Brewington he also found many asteroids

Grfendorf is a municipality in the district of Main Spessart in Bavaria in Germany near Wrzburg Aschaffenburg and Frankfurt As of 2006 1411 live in Grfendorf

The square root of a negative number presents a problem for mathematicians The square root of 9 is three but the square root of 9 is not 3 This is because 3 x 3 9 not 9 For a long time it seemed as though there was no answer to the square root of 9

This is why mathematicians invented the imaginary number i and said that it is the square root of 1 The square root of 1 is not a real number so this definition creates a new type of number just like fractions create numbers like 23 that are not counting numbers like 4 or 10 and negative numbers let us have numbers less than 0 Sometimes mathematicians seem rather comfortable using a number that is so unusual but the name imaginary should not fool you because i is as valid a number as 3 or 145329

It may seem that a number that was basically made up by mathematicians would have no use in the world However many branches of science and engineering have found uses for this number Sometimes electrical engineers need i to understand how an electric circuit will work when they are designing it Certain branches of physics such as quantum physics and high energy physics use i as often as they use any other regular number Many equations in the world simply cannot be solved without i 

Imaginary numbers can be mixed with numbers we are more familiar with For example a real number such as 2 can be added to an imaginary number such as 3i to create 23i These kinds of mixed numbers are known as complex numbers

Maskin was born in New York City New York on December 12 1950 to a non religious Jewish family and grew up in Alpine New Jersey He graduated from Tenafly High School in Tenafly New Jersey in 1968 and then studied at Harvard University where he received his AB and PhD After he got his PhD Maskin went to the University of Cambridge in 1976 where he was a research fellow at Cambridge College He taught at Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1977 1984 and from 1985 2000 at Harvard where he was the Louis Berkman Professor of Economics In 2000 he moved to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton New Jersey

He has studied a wide range of subjects in economic theory such as game theory the economics of incentives and contract theory He is particularly well known for his work on mechanism designimplementation theory and dynamic games His current research projects include comparing different rules for elections the causes of inequality and studying coalition formation He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Econometric Society and the European Economic Association and a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy He was president of the Econometric Society in 2003

 Software patents  Maskin suggested that software patents make new inventions difficult Software semiconductor and computer industries have made many inventions in the past when patent laws have been weak he argued In the 1980s when patent protection was extended to software wrote Maskin Arguments predicted that productivity should have increased among patenting firms Maskins ideas that this would not happen were correct These increases did not occur 

Roger Myerson was born on March 29 1951 to a Jewish family He attended Harvard University where he received his AB SM and PhD all in applied mathematics From 1976 to 2001 he was a professor of economics at Northwestern Universitys Kellogg School of Management Currently he is the Glen A Lloyd Distinguished Service Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago

Among his scientific contributions to game theory and mechanism design the following are noteworthy

Myerson has worked on economic analysis of political institutions and written several major survey papers

His recent work on democratization has raised critical questions about American policy in occupied Iraq

Myerson has published the following books

Mario Renato Capecchi is an Italian born American molecular geneticist He won the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Sir Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies 

Capecchi is Distinguished Professor of Human Genetics and Biology at the University of Utah School of Medicine which he joined in 1973

Mario Capecchi was born in the Italian city of Verona in 1937 His father Luciano Capecchi was an Italian airman who was reported as missing in action in the Western Desert Campaign His mother was called Lucy Ramberg Lucy was an American born daughter of Impressionist painter Lucy Dodd Ramberg and German archaeologist Walter Ramberg During World War II his mother was sent to the Dachau concentration camp as punishment for handing out pamphlets and belonging to an anti Fascist group Before her arrest she had sold her belongings and gave the money to a poor family near Bolzano to give her son a place to live After one year the money was all spent and the family was unable to care for him At four and a half years old he was left to live on the streets of northern Italy for the next four years living in various orphanages and roving through towns with groups of other homeless children

He almost died of hunger His mother had been freed from Dachau and began a year long search for him She finally found him in a hospital bed in Reggio Emilia ill with a fever and living one bowl of chicory coffee and bread crust each day She took him to Rome where he had his first bath in six years

In 1946 his uncle Edward Ramberg an American physicist at RCA sent his mother money to return to the United States Mario and his mother moved to Pennsylvania to live at a cooperative community which had been started by his uncle  

In 1960 Capecchi came to MIT as a graduate student to study physics and mathematics but he soon became interested in molecular biology He moved to Harvard to join the laboratory of James D Watson co discoverer of the shape of DNA Capecchi received his PhD in biophysics in 1967 from Harvard University

In 1973 he joined the faculty at the University of Utah Since 1988 Capecchi has also been an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences He has taught for Duke Universitys Program in Genetics and Genomics

After the Nobel committee announced that Capecchi had won the Nobel prize an Austrian woman named Marlene Bonelli claimed that Capecchi was her long lost half brother which he acknowledged was true

Mario Capecchi is known for his new work in gene targeting of the mouse embryonic stem cells which helped him study other transgenic technologies such as cloning and genetic changing The work on gene targeting and knockout mice won the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded jointly with Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies

Dr Capecchi has also pursued a systematic analysis of the mouse Hox gene family This gene family is used to control embryonic development in all multicellular animals

Warp Technology is fictional technology created within science fiction It is a way of moving objects faster than the speed of light There are many examples of how this idea is used A well known one is found in the Star Trek universe where faster than light travel is needed to tell the story 

Current technology does not allow anything or anyone to go at or faster than the speed of light Unless the current theories are proven wrong this will always be true However warp technology as a fictional idea has been an interesting way of shaping the story line to let spaceships move at speeds greater than 186000 miles per second

Warp technology allows ships move at warp speed In the Star Trek universe for example the actual speed the ship is moving is called the warp factor Warp speed ranges from warp factor 1 up to warp factor 999 In some circumstances Star Trek spaceships can go faster than warp 10 although rare 

Warp factor is a science fiction idea It is mainly based in the Star Trek universe Warp factor is a measurement of the speed of a spaceship Warp factor 1 is equal to the speed of light Star Trek spaceships can go as fast as warp factor 999 There have been a very small number of examples of Star Trek spaceships reaching warp factor 10 and over some even reaching warp factor 13

Christian Heinrich Friedrich Peters was a German American astronomer and one of the first to find asteroids 

He was born in Schleswig Holstein then part of Denmark but later part of Germany and later studied under Carl Friedrich Gauss He spoke many languages and spent time in Italy and Ottoman Turkey before going to the United States in 1854

Working at Hamilton College in Clinton New York he was a good finder of asteroids finding 48 of them beginning with 72 Feronia in 1861 and ending with 287 Nephthys in 1889

He was involved in litigation in 1889 with his old assistant Charles A Borst and the Great Star Catalog Case Peters v Borst went before the Supreme Court of New York The judge sided with Peters but many astronomers and newspapers sided with Borst Peters died not long after After his death the judgement was ultimately reversed on appeal and a new trial was ordered but it never took place

Besides asteroids he co found the periodic comet 80PPeters Hartley and also found different nebulae and galaxies

Soest is a city in North Rhine Westphalia Germany It is the capital of the Soest district

Soest is along the Hellweg road about 50 kilometres east of Dortmund and about 50 kilometres west of Paderborn

Due to the fertile soil the area around Soest was used long before 836 when the village is first mentioned in the Dagobertsche Schenkung although the origin of this document is historically unknown But there is no doubt that Soest has been lived in for a long time excavations in the last two decades have uncovered signs of people living in Soest more than 4000 years ago In the 11th and 12th century Soest grew a lot making it one of the biggest cities in Westphalia with some 10000 citizens It was also an important member of the Hanseatic League until 1609

A self confident Soest from 1444 to 1449 freed itself from the Bishop of Cologne who controlled Westphalia Being no longer capital of Westphalia the city aligned itself with the Duke of Cleves This was a Pyrrhic victory however the city had shown itself strong enough to defy the powerful Archbishop of Cologne but lost much of its trade the freed town was two thirds surrounded by territories with other rulers When the last Duke of Cleves died in 1609 that dukedom was taken by Brandenburg and after a short siege Soest was added into it During and after the Thirty Years War Soest lossed a lot of people and influence at the lowest point in 1756 it had only 3600 citizens

With the start of the Soest district in 1817 its influence slowly rose However the industrialization of the Ruhr area did not reach Soest which continued to be a small city

From about 1953 to 1971 there was a big garrison of Canadian soldiers and their families stationed at Soest as well as Werl and Hemer Iserlohn and Deilinghofen to the south west There were also many Belgian Kasernes located in Soest itself 

From 1971 1993 the old Canadian properties such as the Married Quarters along Hiddingser Weg south of the B 1 were used by British military and families Upon the closing out of Belgian and British army facilities many of these military facilities either became used for civilian purposes or were not used againdestroyed The old Married Quarters area was changed to civilian housing The old CANEX was changed to a NAAFI under the British and was finally demolished in 2006

In 960 Bruno I Archbishop of Cologne moved St Patrocluss relics from Troyes and buried them in 964 at St Patrocluss Cathedral in Soest where he is still today honoured

The Cathedral is a beautiful example of early medieval Romanesque architecture fashioned from the local greenish sandstone Its big squared bell tower or steeple can be seen for many kilometers rising up out of the city centre of the old city and a landmark of the Soester Boerde

The coat of arms shows a key which is the symbol for Saint Peter the patron of Cologne The coat was not changed even after Soest no longer fell within the jurisdiction of Cologne

The history of Europe means all the time when humans lived in the European continent up to the present day 

The first evidence of Homo sapiens in Europe dates back to 35000 BC Europes antiquity dates from Homers Iliad in Ancient Greece of around 700 BC The Roman Republic was established in 509 BC which was usurped by Octavians new Roman Empire at its first century peak The Christian religion was adopted in the fourth century and in the sixth was organized within the Empire by Emperor Justinian I with five most important cities Rome Constantinople Antioch Jerusalem and Alexandria The fall of the Western Roman Empire was followed by a decline of Western Europe The Byzantine Empire kept civilization in the East A schism within the churchs authority in 1054 was added to the earlier division that had persisted since 451 and was followed by Crusades from west to rescue the east from Muslim invasion Feudal society began to break down as the Mongol invaders carried the Black Death with them Constantinople fell in 1453 yet the new world was discovered in 1492 Europe awoke from the medieval period through rediscovery of classical learning The Renaissance was followed by the Protestant Reformation as German priest Martin Luther attacked Papal authority The Thirty Years War the Treaty of Westphalia and the Glorious Revolution laid the basis for a new era of expansion and enlightenment

The Industrial Revolution beginning in Great Britain allowed people for the first time to break from material subsistence The early British Empire split as its colonies in America revolted to establish a representative government Political change in continental Europe was spurred by the French Revolution as people cried out for libert egalit fraternit The French leader Napoleon Bonaparte conquered and reformed the social structure of the continent through war up to 1815 As more and more small property holders were granted the vote in France and the UK socialist and trade union activity developed and revolution gripped Europe in 1848 The last vestiges of serfdom were abolished in Austria Hungary in 1848 Russian serfdom was abolished in 1861 The Balkan nations began to regain their independence from the Ottoman Empire After the Franco Prussian War Italy and Germany were formed from the groups of principalities in 1870 and 1871 Conflict spread across the globe in a chase for empires until the search for a place in the sun ended with the outbreak of World War I In the desperation of war the Russian Revolution promised the people peace bread and land The defeat of Germany came at the price of economic destruction codified into the Treaty of Versailles manifested in the Great Depression and the return to a Second World War After this war Communism spread to Central and Eastern Europe Yugoslavia Bulgaria Romania Albania North Vietnam and North Korea This led to the Cold War a forty year argument between the United States the Soviet Union and their allies Each country wanted to promote their type of government The Soviet Union wanted to spread communism and the United States wanted to spread democracy People across the world feared a nuclear war because of the tension 

Communism became less attractive when it became clear that it could promote economic growth less effectively than then Western states and that it was not suited for a reform that allowed freedom of speech for everybody Therefore the Soviet Union forced in Hungary to give up its reform in 1956 it favoured the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and it stopped reform in Czechoslovakia in 1968 When in 198889 Gorbachev made clear that he would not force the countries of the East block to stick to Communism the Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989 and the Soviet Union collapsed Then the United States was the only superpower left Europe signed a new treaty of union which included 27 European countries in 2007

The Peace of Westphalia refers to the pair of treaties the Treaty of Osnabrck and the Treaty of Mnster signed on May 15 and October 24 of 1648 which ended both the Thirty Years War and the Eighty Years War The treaties involved the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III Habsburg the other German princes Spain France Sweden and representatives of the Dutch Republic The Treaty of the Pyrenees signed in 1659 ending the war between France and Spain is also often considered part of the overall accord

The peace negotiations were held in the cities of Mnster and Osnabrck which lie about 50 km apart from each other in the present day German states of North Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony Sweden had favoured Osnabrck due to its Protestant background France chose Mnster due to its Catholic background In any case two locations were required because Protestant and Catholic leaders refused to meet each other The Catholics used Mnster while the Protestants used Osnabrck

The power which Ferdinand III had taken for himself against the Holy Roman Empires constitution was stripped That meant that the rulers of the German states were again able to determine the religion of their lands 

There were also territorial adjustments

The Battle of Antietam was a battle fought on September 17 1862 It happened near Sharpsburg Maryland It was the first major battle in the American Civil War to happen in the northern states It was the bloodiest single day battle in American history Around 23000 soldiers were killed or wounded in this battle

After pursuing Confederate General Robert E Lee into Maryland Union Army Maj Gen George B McClellan launched attacks against Lees army in defensive positions behind Antietam Creek At dawn on September 17 Maj Gen Joseph Hookers corps mounted a powerful assault on Lees left flank Attacks and counterattacks swept across Millers cornfield and fighting swirled around the Dunker Church Union assaults against the Sunken Road eventually pierced the Confederate center but the Federal advantage was not followed up In the afternoon Maj Gen Ambrose Burnsides corps entered the action capturing a stone bridge over Antietam Creek and advancing against the Confederate right At a crucial moment Maj Gen AP Hills division arrived from Harpers Ferry and launched a surprise counterattack driving back Burnside and ending the battle Although outnumbered two to one Lee committed his entire force while McClellan sent in less than three quarters of his army enabling Lee to fight the Federals to a standstill During the night both armies consolidated their lines In spite of crippling casualties Lee continued to skirmish with McClellan throughout September 18 while removing his battered army south of the river

Despite having superiority of numbers McClellans attacks failed to achieve concentration of mass allowing Lee to counter by shifting forces along interior lines to meet each challenge Despite ample reserve forces that could have been deployed to exploit localized successes McClellan failed to destroy Lees army Nevertheless Lees invasion of Maryland was ended and he was able to withdraw his army back to Virginia without interference from the cautious McClellan There is now an Antietam Memorial Illumination sponsored by volunteers It is a project where they light a candle for every casualty The union had a strategic win over the Confederates

Council of Trent was the 19th Ecumenical council of the Roman Catholic Church Important members of the Catholic Church met in Trento three times between December 13 1545 and December 4 1563 as a reaction to the Protestant Reformation It stated current Catholic doctrines on salvation the sacraments and the Biblical canon it answered all Protestant disputes 

The council often could not meet when they wanted to and sometimes could not meet at all because of resistance from the popes and revolt against the emperor Emperor Charles V wanted the council to meet and Pope Paul III summoned the council in 1537 but the plans fell through In 1538 ideas for a council again failed The pope asked for the council to meet in 1542 but it did not actually meet until 1545 The council was not active from 1547 and 1551 It again met from 1551 to 1552 when it was suspended due to a revolt against the emperor Pope Paul IV strongly disliked Protestant ideas and the council could not start again until his succesor took office The council met for the last time from 1562 to 1563

The Council of Trent was part of the Counter Reformation It would be over 300 years until the next Ecumenical Council

Objects were

1 To stop the ideas and practice of Protestantism and to support the Catholic Churchs ideas

2 To change the parts of the church and actions of church leaders that damaged or hurt the Catholic Churchs ideas and image 

The results were

1 The churchs interpretation of the Bible was final Any Christian who did not agree with the interpretation was a heretic Also the Bible and Church Tradition had equal authority

2 The relationship of faith and works in salvation was defined following disagreements over Martin Luthers doctrine of justification by faith alone

3 Catholic practices such as Indulgences pilgrimages the veneration of saints and relics and the veneration of the Virgin Mary were strongly reaffirmed

The doctrinal decisions of the council are divided into decrees which contain the positive statement of the conciliar dogmas and into short canons which condemn the differing Protestant views with the concluding anathema sit

Original verses by Richard Dybeck

The lyrics in English

The Gospel of Matthew is a book of the Bible It is one of the four gospels of the New Testament that tell the story of the life and teachings of Jesus Matthews Gospel is placed first because thats how God wanted it to be However it is not believed to be the first one that was written It is believed that it was written by the Apostle Matthew who was also called Levi Matthew was one of the Twelve apostles of Jesus The Gospel of Matthew is called one of the synoptic gospels because it has some of the same stories and language as the Gospels of Mark and Luke

Matthew wrote the Gospel mainly for the Jewish people to show them that Jesus is really the Messiah Matthews gospel is similar to both Marks gospel and Lukes gospel and contains many stories about Jesus life which are very alike Matthews gospel has many references to Jewish scripture 

The Gospel of Mark is a book of the Bible It is the second book of the New Testament and comes after the Gospel of Matthew even though it may have been written before it The writer is believed to have been John Mark a friend of Simon Peter who was one of the Twelve apostles of Jesus 

The four gospels tell the story of the life of Jesus The word gospel means good news The Gospel of Mark moves quickly and the story shows how much Jesus worked during his short 3 year ministry Marks gospel tells many things about Jesus which are also found in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke 

The Gospel of Luke is a book of the Bible Like the other gospels the Gospel of Luke tells the stories of the life and teachings of Jesus It is the third book of the New Testament and comes after the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Mark The gospel is believed to be written by Luke who was a friend of the Apostle Paul 

Luke was a doctor He wrote his gospel for a man called Theophilus Luke wrote another book which is fifth in the New Testament the Acts of the Apostles which tells what Jesuss disciples did after his rise back to Heaven

Unlike the gospel writers Matthew Mark and John Luke was probably not Jewish but was Greek He wrote the gospel mainly for non Jewish people Luke wrote to prove that Jesus is the Son of God Lukes gospel contains many similar stories of Jesus He tells more about the birth of Jesus than the other gospel writers 

The Gospel of John is a book of the Bible It is one of the four gospels at the beginning of the New Testament The four gospels tell the story of the life of Jesus The Gospel of John is the fourth book of the New Testament after the gospels of Matthew Mark and Luke

In the gospel it is says that the book was written by the disciple whom Jesus loved It is believed that John the Apostle the son of Zebedee wrote the gospel He was probably the youngest of the Twelve apostles of Jesus John lived a long life and was imprisoned on the Island of Patmos in his old age He also wrote the last book of the New Testament called the Book of Revelation 

The Gospel of John tells many of the stories of Jesus life that are in the other three gospels but also contains a lot of different information The Gospel begins by calling Jesus the Word It says In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God In Johns Gospel the writer shows that Jesus was part of God who came to live among humanity so that they could hear His voice and have the power to become true children of God 

According to the gospel the accounts are written so that the reader may believe that Jesus is the Messiah the Son of God and that by believing you may have life in His name

There is some disagreement over whether the John who wrote the letters of John the John who wrote The Gospel of John and the John who wrote the Book of Revelation are the same person

The Epistle to the Romans or Letter to the Romans is one of the letters written by Apostle Paul to a church elsewhere Here the letter is addressed to the early Church in Rome

Paul wrote the letter to the Romans to explain a very important point in Christianity He proves by quoting the Old Testament that all humankind is guilty of sin before God People whom God calls righteous can only do so by trusting in Gods ways and not by their own effort 

Only by believing in Jesus who is the Christ and who died for humanity for their sins can people be saved

Once this belief is had the believer receives the Holy Spirit who helps the believer live a new life Paul asks the Romans to observe Christian ethics and submit themselves to authorities

The letter remains very influential in explaining to non Christians and new Christians what their Christian belief is all about

The First Epistle to the Corinthians or the First Letter to the Corinthians is a long letter written by the Apostle Paul to the church in Corinth

Paul wrote to the Corinthian church for a number of reasons He realizes the church at Corinth is divided and explains that although himself and a few disciples had helped start the church the church was really headed by Christ Jesus Himself I planted the seed Apollos watered it but God has been making it grow 

Paul scolds the church members there for sexual immorality and asks for these immoral people to be thrown out of the church 

He gives instructions for marriage against worshipping worthless idols for spiritual gifts like prophecy Paul praises the superior way of love and urges the church to be united 

At the end Paul states that the resurrection of Christ is true He supports it with testimonies from more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters and it is this very truth which makes certain the believers will have eternal life

Finally Paul tells of his plans to visit the Corinthians and that Timothy his co worker is coming to their church very soon

The Epistle to the Hebrews or Letter to the Hebrews is one of the letters of the New Testament Although it is believed by many to be written by the Apostle Paul many others think it might have been written by one group of early Christians to a general group of Jews or to a church with Jewish members

The letter explains that Jesus Christ the Son of God is the perfect sacrifice for human sinners He is superior to angels and is our High priest in the order of Melchizedek Jesus is the Messiah whose coming gives us the superior New Covenant as compared to the Old Covenant of Abraham The writers state that if the Old Covenant was faultless God would not have sent his Son to start a new one

By stating that people are called righteous through their faith and belief in Gods ways the writers urge the readers to receive Gods grace by accepting Jesus Christ

Alan Kuo is a Taiwanese rock singer and actor

C rock is short for Chinese rock music C rock can be performed in any dialect of Chinese language Some people consider C rock a subgenre of C pop

The history of C rock before the 1980s is very unclear though it is believed to have existed in the 1970s or even the 1960s

The first clear sign of Chinese rock was the Xi Bei Feng Xi Bei Feng is style of folk influenced punk music originating from the northwestern area of China such as the Shanxi and Gansu provinces The new style was triggered by two new songs Xin Tian You and As time passed Xi Bei Feng became stronger more fast tempo and aggressive In contrast to the mellow C pop style XBF songs were sung loudly and forcefully

Many XBF songs chanllenged political views reflected unhappiness among Chinese youth and individuality and self empowerment Both music and lyrics articulated a sense of pride in the power of the northwests peasantry Songs such as came to represent an earthy primordial masculine image of China as opposed to the soft sweet polished urban gang tai style

 also known as Prison songs or Prison rock became popular in the late 1980s Prison rock was more folk like than the XBF style Prison rock was led  created by Chi Zhi Qiang who wrote lyrics about his time in jail and set them to folk melodies from northeast China In contrast to Northwest Wind songs prison songs were slow and weepy and were characterised by the rudevulgar language and lyrics showing pessimism despair anticonformity and cynicism

The birthplace of Chinese rock was Beijing Rock and roll was not common until the late 1980s Some rebellious trends from punk XBF were revived In 1989 and 1990 rock and roll came into mainstream music as a combination of the Northwest Wind and prison song fads 

After the protests in Tiananmen Square rock and roll became part of general urban youth culture in China Its popularity growth celebrated on 17 and 18 February 1990 when Beijings largest rock concert was held in the Capital Gymnasium The concert featured six rock bands

Chinese rock and rolls peak popularity was between 1990 and 1993 Many rock bands were established and rock music was performed regularly Rock and roll was not approved of by the Chinese government because many performers had anti conformist behaviour The government made sure that rock and roll was not to be broadcast on CCTV so the main venues remained to be informal underground rock parties Some fans and performers had characteristics such as long hair for males jeans silver metal ornaments black leather coats and hippie style behaviour

By 1994 rock and roll slowly began to decline One of the reasons is because of the censorship by the Communist Party of China such as the banning of rock from television and restrictions on performances The main reason however is the general lack of interest in anti conformist and anti Government thoughts and behaviour In the mid 1990s people became more interested in C pop and newer stars at the time such as Andy Lau and the Four Heavenly Kings of Cantonese pop

From 2000 to 2004 rock in China grew in popularity again influenced by Japanese rock trends including pop rock Visual kei and Gothic Lolitta and some American rock music styles such as light rock soft rock piano rock post grunge and alternative rock

Another important step in the development of Chinese rock music is the Beijing Midi School of Music in Beijing Established 1993 by Zhang Fan it was the first school in China offering classes specialising in jazz and rock music Started as a festival in 1999 the Midi Modern Music Festival became the largest rock music festival in China Both the school and the festival supported the underground scene in China and allowed foreign bands in 2006 to perform at the festival and throughout the country including Alev Monokino YMA and The Wombats 

In addition to the Midi school the goth rock magazine Painkiller Magazine brought bands such as Edguy Lacrimosa and Hatesphere to fame in China

A mold consists of two plates and alighment pins for a sure fitThe upper and lower plate each having grooves and recesses for the actual product and the excess material Products such as o rings and tires are made using such molds Molds can vary greatly in sixe from a few inches across the several feet across and weighing thousands of pounds They are usually made of hardened steel for wear resistance

Compression molds work by taking the empty mold and placing a piece of unshaped rubber inside The mold is then pressed shut using high heat and pressure forcing the rubber to liquify and flow into the recess created for the part while excess rubber is forced into the molds dump groove It is important when making a mold to keep in mind that when the part cools it will shrink slightly

Injection molds work under the same principle as compression molds except that instead of pressing the mold together on the rubber the mold is first closed and the liquid rubber is then injected into a fill hole drilled into the mold This is used more for plastic products

The Reformed churches are a group of Christian Protestant denominations that are historically related by a doctrine that is identical or similar to Calvinism It developed in the Swiss Reformation led by Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin but soon afterwards appeared in nations throughout Western Europe Each nation in which the Reformed movement was originally established had its own church government Several of these local churches have expanded to worldwide denominations and most have experienced splits into multiple denominations 

The first Reformed Churches were established in Europe in the 1500s in the wake of the Protestant Reformation

Reformed doctrine is expressed in various texts Some of them are used by many denominations Different denominations use different confessions usually based on historical reasons Some of the confessions still commonly in use are

Brainin was released after a few months but Schidlof remained in the camp where he met Nissel Finally Schidlof and Nissel were released and the three of them were able to study with violin pedagogue Max Rostal who taught them free of charge It was through Rostal that they met cellist Martin Lovett and in 1947 they formed the Brainin Quartet which was renamed the Amadeus Quartet in 1948

The Amadeus was one of the most celebrated quartets of the 20th Century and its members were awarded numerous honours including

The group gave its first performance as the Amadeus Quartet in the Wigmore Hall London on Jan 10 1948 They were soon performing in concerts festivals and masterclasses all over the world The quartet made about 200 recordings among them the complete quartets of Ludwig van Beethoven Johannes Brahms and W A Mozart They also performed works by such 20th century composers as Bla Bartk and Benjamin Britten

Transport Layer Security Protocol and its predecessor Secure Sockets Layer are cryptographic protocols that provide security and data integrity for communications over TCPIP networks such as the Internet Several versions of the protocols are common in applications such as web browsing electronic mail Internet faxing instant messaging and voice over IP

The TLS protocol allows applications to communicate across a network in a way designed to prevent eavesdropping tampering and message forgery TLS provides endpoint authentication and communications confidentiality over the Internet using cryptography Most of the time only the server is authenticated while the client remains unauthenticated this means that the end user can be sure with whom it is communicating The next level of security is known as mutual authentication Mutual authentication requires public key infrastructure deployment to clients unless TLS PSK or the Secure Remote Password protocol are used which provide strong mutual authentication without needing to deploy a PKI

SSL and TLS have been widely used in several open source software projects Programmers may use the OpenSSL NSS or GnuTLS libraries for SSLTLS functionality Microsoft Windows includes a usage of SSL and TLS as part of its Secure Channel package Delphi programmers may use a library called Indy

King Features Syndicate a cartoon publisher produced an animated series featuring the Beatless broken wikt linklikenesslikenesses and songs The Beatles had a contract with United Artists to make three movies for them but had not liked the way their second movie Help had turned out They did not want to appear in another movie When George Dunning and Al Brodax who directed and produced their cartoon series asked the Beatles for permission to make a cartoon based on Yellow Submarine they agreed mostly because the cartoon would help them finish their movie contract

More Beatles songs would be featured in the movie Along with using songs they had already recorded the Beatles were expected to make new music especially for the cartoon They did not put much effort into making this music Instead they set aside broken wikt linkleftoverleftover songs or songs that had not turned out as well as they had hoped to give to the producers In all only four new songs were set aside for the movie Two were written by George Harrison

The band helped more with ideas for the movies story adding jokes and things they thought would make an audience laugh Erich Segal who later became famous for his novels Love Story and Olivers Story helped write the screenplay for Yellow Submarine The Beatles speaking voices in the movie were not their own but were provided by actors

The broken wikt linkanimatoranimators working on the movie did their best to make it entertaining and interesting George Martin who was the Beatless music producer composed orchestral music to play behind the dialogue He also worked hard to make the music fit well with the broken wikt linkimageryimagery of the cartoon

The Beatles themselves produced a broken wikt linktelevision specialtelevision special Magical Mystery Tour which was shown on British TV over the Christmas holidays in 1967 It was strange and did not have a normal broken wikt linkstorylinestoryline Many people who saw it did not like it and ABC in the United States cancelled their plans to show Magical Mystery Tour in America The failure of the show hurt the Beatless reputation even though the soundtrack still sold well Yellow Submarine was scheduled to appear in cinemas during 1968 and many hopes were placed on it to be a success

When the Beatles saw an unfinished version of the cartoon they were very pleased and impressed with it They decided to appear in a broken wikt linklive actionlive action broken wikt linkepilogueepilogue to finish the movie Yellow Submarine made its public debut on June 6 1968 and became an instant hit with audiences especially with children and families Most of the people who saw the movie did not know how little the Beatles had really been involved with making it or even thought to ask Many of their later memories of the Beatles were based on what they saw in Yellow Submarine

Even though one song Hey Bulldog had been recorded specially for the movie its sequence was edited out of the American version The title still appeared in its credits however

Much of the movie is set in Pepperland an broken wikt linkunderseaundersea country filled with happiness music kindness and peace The Blue Meanies who hate anything that is positive invade Pepperland taking it over and doing their best to destroy everything that the Pepperlanders love Old Fred a servant of Pepperlands broken wikt linkLord MayorLord Mayor escapes the invasion in a yellow submarine and seeks help

He finds it in Liverpool England in the form of the Beatles whom he brings back to Pepperland They pass through the Sea of Time the Sea of Holes the Sea of Monsters and the Sea of Green finally reaching Pepperland Disguised as Sergeant Peppers Band they bring music back to the country and are able to defeat the Blue Meanies Rather than chase away or destroy the Blue Meanies they instead invite them to the victory celebration The Meanies change their ways and learn to enjoy the things that make Pepperland a happy place

The movies soundtrack album did not appear until months after the movie was first shown Another album The Beatles came out first The first half of Yellow Submarine featured the four new songs the title song and All You Need Is Love which played a major part in the storyline The other half featured George Martins orchestral broken wikt linkmusic scorescore broken wikt linkrecording tapeTape versions of the album also included Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds between the two halves

Some critics and fans noticed that only a few Beatles songs appeared on the album and were disappointed Most did not care and bought copies to hear the music The album became another hit for the band

Yellow Submarine was still popular years later even after the Beatles disbanded in 1970 It appeared on television many times during the 1970s and 1980s and also in small second run theaters During the 1970s John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono had a son together named Sean Sean did not know his parents were famous One day he saw the movie on television at his broken wikt linkbabysitterbabysitters house and came home full of questions about his fathers Beatle past Lennon told Sean that he gave up being a famous musician so he could be a family man

In 1998 Yellow Submarine was broken wikt linkremasterremastered for a re release thirty years after it first appeared Movie and recording technology had improved greatly over the years and both the producers and Apple Corps the Beatless company did not want the movie to seem old or outdated They put much work into the remastering The original version had been in broken wikt linkmonophonicmonophonic sound Most movie theaters now had broken wikt linkSurround SoundSurround Sound and the producers wanted to broken wikt linkupgradeupgrade the sound if they could

For many years the Beatles had not allowed any broken wikt linkremixingremixing of their music They made an exception for Yellow Submarine though Technicians went back to the original recordings using new machines and ideas to make them sound better than ever before John Lennon had died in 1980 but the surviving former Beatles all approved the new mixes Ringo Starr was impressed most of all and was pleased that parts of the music could be heard that had never been heard before

Along with a broken wikt linktheatricaltheatrical re release the remastered Yellow Submarine was also issued on videotape and DVD A new soundtrack album was also issued that included the new mixes of all the songs used in the movie

A discrete cosine transform is a math process that can be used to make things like MP3s and JPEGs smaller It does this by breaking the sound or picture into different frequencies

One way to calculate a discrete cosine transform is to use the Fourier transformation Discrete means that it works on discrete time signals

For sounds frequencies are the same as simple tones You can make any sound by playing several tones at the same time The discrete cosine transform is a way to find out which tones to play in order to make a given sound The only difference between the tones is their pitch

Human ears are good at hearing low pitches but bad at hearing high pitches If you use the DCT to break a sound into tones you do not need to be as careful when playing the higher tones because people cannot hear them as well MP3 encoders use this fact to make the sound smaller

With pictures frequencies are like stripes and checker patterns Just like with sound you can make any picture out of different frequencies Also like sound peoples eyes are not as good at seeing high frequencies as low frequencies JPEG encoders use this fact almost exactly the same way as MP3 encoders do

French polishing is a way of giving a high standard of finish to wood

The careful and skilled multiple layering of shellac polish on properly prepared wood when completed results in a lusterous perfectly flat shine of an exceedingly high standard Indeed when applied correctly a french polished application can rarely be matched for sheer quality of finish

Normally practiced by highly skilled craftsmen and women one might normally fine excellent examples of this superb finish in some of our stately homes although plenty of other examples exist The advent of lacquered wood finishes has tended to make french polishing less needed in todays world

The Round Table was a table used by King Arthur and his knights in the legends about him The Round Table was in Camelot the castle where King Arthur and his knights lived In the legends they met at the table to talk about the safety of Camelot and the kingdom and about what adventures and quests they could go on This got them the name The Knights of the Round Table

The shape of the table was very important Most tables are rectangular and have a place called the head of the table This is the narrow part at the top where the leader usually sits Because the table was round it meant that the people who sat around it were all seen as equal

The table is used by King Arthur and his knights King Arthurs wife Guinevere did not have a seat at the table but King Arthur did take her advice on occasion In some versions of the legend the wizard who lived in Camelot called Merlin also had a seat at the table He was seen by King Arthur as a good friend and adviser 

Some legends also note a special chair at the Round Table called the Siege Perilous or Dangerous Chair Legend says that the seat could only be used by a knight who had a pure heart A person with a pure heart was seen as someone who had committed no crimes or done any wrong In the tale anyone who sat in the chair but did not have a pure heart would die instantly It was kept free by Merlin for the person who would one day find an object called the Holy Grail This was a magical cup that was supposed to have been the one that Jesus drank out of during the Last Supper In the story this person was either Sir Gallahad or Sir Perceval depending on what version of the story is told

She was shown in art as a scorpion or as a woman with a scorpion on her head Serket did not have any temples but she had many priests

Many people in ancient Egypt who were bitten by poisonous animals died from the poison Because of this Serket was also known as a protector of the dead She was associated with fluids that cause stiffening during embalming This caused her to become known as a protector of embalmers tents and of the canopic jar for the intestine The intestines canopic jar was the one associated with poisons 

Because she was a protector of canopic jars Serket was associated with Aset and Nebet Het and Neith Later Serket began to be known as Isis Serket came to be known as a part of Isis instead of a separate goddess

Tempera is a type of artists paint It was the main medium used for panel painting and illuminated manuscripts in the Byzantine world and the Middle Ages in Europe until it was replaced by oil painting as the most popular medium for large paintings It is still used for Orthodox icons Some modern painters use tempera 

In modern times some manufacturers call ordinary poster paint by the name of tempera Poster paint is not really tempera It is a different type of paint called gouache 

Egg yolk dries and sticks very firmly It is used to mix and set the paints in a tempera painting The colours are ground up into dry powders that must be mixed by the artist In earlier times some of the paints were very poisonous and the artist had to be careful not to breathe in the powdered paint The paints are generally mixed with equal parts of egg yolk and water If there is too much egg the paint is gooey If there is too much water it is runny Neither of these things are good Some artists like to mix some of the egg white as well for a different effect Sometimes some oil is added In ancient times other things were added which might include honey milk and plant gums

The painting must be done over a ground that has already been prepared The ground is smooth flat paint on a strong board that does not bend The paint must be put on in thin layers with tiny brush strokes that dry very quickly Because the paint is transparent the artists use a special technique They often paint the shadows on the figure before they paint the skin colour and colour of the clothing over the top 

When the painting is finished it is not very brightly coloured until it has been varnished This makes the colours bright and shiny The good thing about tempera painting is that the colours do not change over the years whereas oil paintings change get darker and go more yellow Tempera paintings can last well for at least two thousand years Because tempera paintings take a long time to do many of them are small Sometimes artists painted large altarpieces in tempera One of the biggest tempera paintings is Duccios picture of the Madonna and Child in the Uffizi Gallery It is about 15 feet high Another very famous large tempera painting is Botticellis Birth of Venus which is also in the Uffizi

Some of the oldest paintings in tempera are funeral portraits of dead people done is Egypt during the time of Ancient Rome Tempera continued to be used for Christian religious paintings It was the medium for Greek icons and was used in Italy and many other countries until oil painting came into use in about 1500 Most of the famous Italian Renaissance painters used tempera This includes Duccio Giotto Fra Angelico Botticelli and Michelangelo In Northern Europe they used oil paint This started to become popular in Italy in the 1570s Leonardo painted the Mona Lisa in oil paint Nowadays although oil paint and vinyl paint are much more common some artists paint in tempera One of the most famous tempera painters of the 20th century is Andrew Wyeth

Tempera is a form of art painted using water soluable and glutinous materials Such as goats cheese cows milk egg yolk goats milk and etc It was mixed with pigments of colours like bark and natural resources

Decision making is the mental process that leads to the selection of an action among several alternatives Every decision making process produces a final choice The output can be an action or an opinion 

Trichotillomania or trich as it is commonly known is a disorder causing a person to take out hair from anywhere on the body sometimes ending in notable areas without hair Trichotillomania is listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as an impulse control disorder but there are questions about how it should be listed At different times it may seem to be a habit an addiction a tic disorder or an obsessive compulsive disorder

Terror is a state of fear an overwhelming sense of imminent danger

Terror could also mean

The Reign of Terror or simply The Terror was a period of about 11 months during the French Revolution During this time French people who did not support the revolution were executed at the guillotine

The Reign of Terror started on 5 September 1793 The violence happened more and more often in June and July of 1794 a period called la Grande Terreur which ended 27 July 1794 when several important leaders of the Reign of Terror were executed including Saint Just and Robespierre The Terror took the lives of between 18500 to 40000 people

After the Reign of Terror Napoleon Bonaparte rose to be the emperor of France

Faction or factionalism can refer to

A political faction is a grouping of individuals especially within a political organisation such as a political party a trade union or other group with a political purpose  It may also be called a power bloc or a voting bloc 

The individuals within a faction are united in a common goal for the organisation they are a part of They stick together to achieve this goal and improve their position within the organisation

A political faction could be described as a party within a party But political factions are not limited to political parties they can form within any group that has some sort of political aim or purpose

The French Constitution of 1791 was the very first written Constitution of France It was an important result of the French Revolution and adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen as its introduction

This Constitution meant the creation of a French constitutional monarchy The main controversy was the level of power to be granted to the King of France in such a system After very long negotiations the long expected first Constitution was brought in September of 1791 

Although it helped make the Constitutional Monarchy the King flew to Varennes due to the radicalism of Jacobins

The principle of Separation of powers was the basis for the Constitution The National Convention was the legislative body the King and the Ministers made up the executive branch and the judicial branch was independent from the other two However the French Revolution still continued after this document was signed 

The constitution attempted to establish a liberal bourgeois constitutional monarchy but this did not work out On 10 August 1792 the monarchy of France ended 

Executive may mean

The Knights of the Round Table were characters in the legends about King Arthur They were the best knights in King Arthurs kingdom and lived in King Arthurs castle Camelot They were called the Knights of the Round Table because of a special table in Camelot that was round instead of rectangular This meant that everyone who sat around it was seen as equal

In order to become a Knight of the Round Table a knight had to prove he was chivalrous enough In the legend the knights swore a Code of Chivalry which is much like an oath is today This meant that they promised to uphold the rules given to them once they became a Knight of the Round Table

Sir Thomas Malory was an English writer who wrote a book based on the legend of King Arthur It was called Le Morte dArthur In it he wrote his version of the Code of Chivalry

In different stories there are different numbers of knights ranging from 12 to more than 150 The Winchester Round Table says there were 25 Knights However the most commonly listed Knights of the Round Table are these

This is a list of other knights mentioned as being Knights of the Round Table

In political science and constitutional law the executive is the branch of government that is responsible for the day to day management of the state 

In many countries one simply speaks of the government but this usage can be confusing in an international context The executive branch contains the head of government who is the head of this branch Under the doctrine of the separation of powers the executive is not supposed to make laws nor to interpret them their purpose is to enforce them in practice this separation is rarely absolute The executive is identified by the head of Government In a presidential system this person may also be the head of State where as in a parliamentary system he or she is usually the leader of the largest party in the legislature and is most commonly termed the Prime Minister In France executive power is shared between the President and the Prime Minister and this system has been reproduced in a number of former French colonies Switzerland and Bosnia and Herzegovina have similar collegiate systems for the role of head of state and Government The Head of Government is assisted by a number of ministers who usually have responsibilities for particular areas and by a large number of government employees or civil servants

The IPCC shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President of the United States Al Gore who won for working on the same problems

A lot of IPCC work is publishing reports about the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change an international agreement that human inventions and chemistry may make the Earth too warm to live on The UNFCCC was the beginning of the Kyoto Protocol Members of the IPCC read write and calculate as much as they can Only member states of the WMO and UNEP may be members of IPCC A lot of professors trust the IPCC work

The first IPCC report was published in 1990 More was added to that report in 1992 The second report was published in 1995 the third was published in 2001 and a fourth in 2007 Each report is in three books called Working Groups 1 2 and 3 Most times the IPCC report means the Working Group I report which is about basic climate change

The Fourth Assessment Report was completed in early 2007 Like earlier IPCC reports it contains four reports three of them from its working groups

Working Group 1 was about the Physical Science Basis of Climate Change  The Working Group 1 report was published on February 2 2007 and revised on February 2007 There was also a February 2 2007 press release The full Working Group 1 report was published in March The main report says

The Summary for Policymakers for the Working Group 2 report was published on April 6 2007 The Summary for Policymakers for the Working Group 3 report was published on May 4 2007

The Third Assessment Report contains four reports three of them from its working groups

The headlines from the Summary for Policymakers in The Scientific Basis were

The estimate for the climate sensitivity was 15 to 45 C and the average temperature was predicted to increase by 14 to 58 Celsius degrees between 1990 and 2100 and the sea level was predicted to rise between 01 and 09 meters The range of predictions is based on different levels of human carbon dioxide production Each perdiction has different possible outcomes

IPCC used the best predictions and their reports were watched by important scientists The IPCC believed they needed better predictions and better understanding of climate Some scientists claim the IPCC do not know enough about greenhouse gases to make good predictionsFactdateJuly 2007

MIT professor Richard Lindzen who works for the IPCC Working Group 1 claims some of the IPCC reports are wrong He told the US Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation that he was unhappy about the Executive Summary based on his work in May 2001 He said that he told the IPCC they were making mistakes and the Working Group 1 report said that meant they were making improvements

Professor Lindzen said

The summary does not reflect the full document For example I worked on Chapter 7 Physical Processes This chapter dealt with the nature of the basic processes which determine the response of climate and found numerous problems with model treatments including those of clouds and water vapor The chapter was summarized with the following sentence Understanding of climate processes and their incorporation in climate models have improved including water vapor sea ice dynamics and ocean heat transport

The Working Group 1 report said

Climate Change 1995 the IPCC Second Assessment Report was finished in 1996 It was made in four parts

Each of the working groups was made by its own working group and each has a Summary for Policymakers that is a list of agreements by governments The Summary for Policy Makers of the Working Group 1 report says

Three scientists involved in climate research believe that the IPCC reports do not accurately summarize the state of knowledge

On December 20 1995 Reuters news agency claimed a British scientist Keith Shine one of IPCCs most important authors talking about the Policymakers Summary said We produce a draft and then the policymakers go through it line by line and change the way it is presented Its peculiar that they have the final say in what goes into a scientists report Keith Shine did not say what differences the changes make

Physicist Frederick Seitz the President Emeritus of Rockefeller University said the IPCC report was not good writing I have never witnessed a more disturbing corruption of the peer review process than the events that led to this IPCC report He opposed it in the Leipzig Declaration of S Fred Singers Science and Environmental Policy Project

Professor Seitzs comments were opposed by the presidents of the American Meteorological Society and University Corporation for Atmospheric Research who wrote about an effort by some people make it seem that humans had not changed the climate 

S Fred Singer said that 

Benjamin D Santer Lead Author of Chapter 8 of 1995 IPCC Working Group 1 report said 

The Second Assessment Report was the only one with a chapter on the economic effect of climate change This part of the report was thought to be unfair because the value of life in poorer countries was less

The 1992 supplementary report was an update of the 1990 report requested for the Framework Convention on Climate Change at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992

It did not make any important changes to the 1990 report It claimed the prediction methods in the First Assessment Report were now improved but did not include aerosol or ozone changes

The IPCC first assessment report was completed in 1990 and used to make the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change

The Working Group 1 report says

The Chairperson of the IPCC is Rajendra K Pachauri elected in May 2002 before that Robert Watson headed the IPCC The chairperson is helped by an elected Bureau including vice chairpersons Working Group co chairpersons and a Secretariat 

The IPCC Panel is made of people from governments and other groups Scientific experts are preferred Meetings of the IPCC and IPCC Working Groups are held by members of governments Non Governmental and Intergovernmenta Organizations may be allowed to attend as observers Meetings of the IPCC Bureau workshops experts and lead authors are by invitation only 350 government officials and climate change experts visited the 2003 meeting The meeting report says there were 322 persons in attendance at meetings with about seven eighths of visitors being from governments

There are several major groups

The IPCC receives funding from UNEP WMO and its own Trust Fund which gets money from governments

People from over 130 countries contributed to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report over 6 years These people included more than 2500 scientific expert reviewers more than 800 contributing authors and more than 450 lead authors

The Working Group 1 report of 2007 included contributions by 600 authors from 40 countries over 620 expert reviewers a large number of government reviewers and representatives from 113 governments 

The IPCC activities are controlled by the WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council to support the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change

In April 2006 the IPCC released the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report or AR4 Reports of the workshops held so far are available at the IPCC website

The AR4 Synthesis Report was finalized in November 2007 Documentation on the meetings for the AR4 are available the outlines for the Working Group 1 report PDFlink115 KiB and a provisional author list PDFlink108 KiB

The IPCC also supports other activities such as the Data Distribution Centre and the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme This involves estimating greenhouse gas based on the levels of fuel used industrial production and so on

The IPCC also answers questions from the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice

The IPCC reports are a collection of peer reviewed and published science Each IPCC report explains improvements to the previous report and also explains where more research is needed

There are usually three stages in the review PDFlink557 KiB

Review comments are open to the public for at least five years

There are several ways to agree what goes into the reportsPDFlink557 KiB

The Panel controls what the IPCC agrees on to meet standards The Panels approval process has been criticized for changing what the experts put in the Reports

Each chapter has a lot of authors who are responsible for writing and editing the material A chapter usually has two Coordinating Lead Authors who control what words go in their chapter ten to fifteen Lead Authors and a larger number of Contributing Authors The Lead Authors put together the work of the other authors and report to the Working Group chairs Lead Authors write sections of chapters Contributing Authors prepare text graphs and data

Authors are chosen from a list of researchers prepared by governments other important groups the Working GroupTask Force Bureaux and other experts The group of Coordinating Lead Authors and Lead Authors for a section or chapter of a Report is expected to have many different views and to have people from different parts of the world

In December 2007 the IPCC was awarded the The Nobel Peace Prize 2007 for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change The award is shared with Former US Vice President Al Gore for his work on climate change and the documentary An Inconvenient Truth

In January 2005 Christopher Landsea resigned from work on the IPCC AR4 saying that it was both being motivated by pre conceived agendas and being scientifically unsound because of Kevin Trenberths idea that global warming was contributing to recent hurricane activity Roger A Pielke who published Landseas letter writes How anyone can deny that political factors were everpresent in the negotiations isnt paying attention but says that Despite the pressures on tropical cyclones they figured out a way to maintain consistency with the actual balance of opinion in the community of relevant experts He continues So there might be a human contribution but the human contribution itself has not been quantitatively assessed yet the experts using their judgment expect it to be there In plain English this is what is called a hypothesis and not a conclusion And it is a fair representation of the issue

The IPCC Third Assessment Report showed a graph labeled Millennial Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction from a paper by Mann Bradley and Hughes often called the Hockey Stick Graph This graph was different to the IPCC First assessment report which showed global temperature for the past 1000 years and higher temperatures during the Medieval Warm Period The graph was thought to show that temperatures between 1000 and 1900 were very different This was criticized in an article by Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick In a 2006 letter to Nature Bradley Hughes and Mann claimed the original article had said that they could not be exact

Some critics say the IPCC reports underestimate dangers understate risks and report only the lowest risks

On February 1 2007 the night before publication of IPCCs report on climate a study was published saying that temperatures and sea levels have been rising at or above the speed the IPCC reported in 2001 The study compared IPCC 2001 predictions of temperature and sea level change with what actually happened Over the six years the actual temperature rise was near the top end of the range given by IPCCs 2001 prediction and the actual rise was more than the top of the range the IPCC predicted

An example of scientific research which has indicated that predictions by the IPCC have uderstated risks is a study on rises in sea levels

Political influence on the IPCC has been shown by the release of a memo by ExxonMobil to the Bush administration and its effects on the IPCCs leadership The Bush administration at the request of ExxonMobil wanted rid of Robert Watson a climate scientist and IPCC chairperson and to have him replaced by Pachauri who was seen at the time as more friendly to industry

In 2005 the UK House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs produced a report on the economics of climate change It commented on the IPCC process

We have some concerns about the objectivity of the IPCC process with some of its emissions scenarios and summary documentation apparently influenced by political considerations There are significant doubts about some aspects of the IPCCs emissions scenario exercise in particular the high emissions scenarios The Government should press the IPCC to change their approach There are some positive aspects to global warming and these appear to have been played down in the IPCC reports the Government should press the IPCC to reflect in a more balanced way the costs and benefits of climate change The Government should press the IPCC for better estimates of the monetary costs of global warming damage and for explicit monetary comparisons between the costs of measures to control warming and their benefits Since warming will continue regardless of action now due to the lengthy time lags

The Zimmermann Telegram was a telegram sent to Mexico from Germany on January 16 1917 It was what made America enter World War I It is named for the German man who sent it Arthur Zimmermann Zimmerman was the German Foreign Secretary Zimmermann sent it to the German ambassador in the United States Johann von Bernstorff Bernstorff then sent it to the German ambassador in Mexico Heinrich von Eckardt

The telegram told the Mexicans to join the war on the Germans side in the Central Powers The telegram told the minister to tell the Mexicans to attack America Germany promised to give Mexico back all the land the United States had taken from Mexico if they helped the Germans win the war America took Texas New Mexico and Arizona from Mexico Germany wanted America to enter the war so America would stop helping the enemies of Germany Germany wanted to get America to go to war with Mexico to distract America 

The British secretly got the telegram They were able to decode the telegram They held on to the telegram until February 24 1917 They gave it to President Woodrow Wilson of the United States of America President Wilson published the telegram The telegram made the American people angry Wilson asked Congress for a Declaration of War Congress accepted the request on April 2 1917 The United States of America announced war on Germany on April 6 1917 America did not want to join the war The telegram is what made America come into the war

The Battle of Stalingrad is a battle fought during the Second World War between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union They were fighting for control of the city of Stalingrad The battle was fought between 17 July 1942 and 2 February 1943 It was one of the most important battles of the Second World War

Stalingrad now Volgograd was a city on the Volga River It was an important industrial city If the Germans had won the battle then they would also have been able to control the Caucasus area of Russia which had a lot of oil Hitler also wanted to capture Stalingrad because it was named after Josef Stalin the leader of the Soviet Union

In June 1942 Adolf Hitler launched Operation Blue which was an offensive attack in southern Russia By the end of July the German army had reached Stalingrad and the German air force the Luftwaffe started bombing the city During the Summer and Autumn of 1942 the Germans dropped 1000 tonnes of bombs on Stalingrad A bombing raid on 23 August 1942 caused a huge fire The bombing turned the city into ruins However the rubble gave the Russians hiding places from which they could attack the Germans using snipers

Hitler and Stalin sent in large numbers of soldiers They ordered that there was to be no retreat

16 million casualties were reported in battle in total with more Russian deaths but it was a good morale victory for the Russians because they had defeated so many Germans

Stalingrad was known as Tsaritsyn until 1925 and is Volgograd since 1961 

World War I reparations means the payments and transfers of property and equipment that Germany was forced to make after its defeat during World War I

Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles declared Germany and its allies responsible for all loss and damage of the Allies during the war and set up the basis for reparations

In January 1921 the total sum due was decided by an Inter Allied Reparations Commission and was set at 269 billion gold marks about 236 billion or 32 billion This was a sum that many economists believed to be too much Later that year the amount was reduced to 132 billion marks which still seemed too much for most German observers both because of the amount itself as well as the terms

Germany stopped to pay the reparations after Hitlers Nazi Party took power in 1933 About one eighth of the reparations paid by then The final payments were made on the day exactly 20 years after German reunification

There was large debate about the justice and likely impact of the reparations decided John Maynard Keynes resigned form the British Treasury in 1919 to protest this high sum of money demanded

The 1924 Dawes Plan changed Germanys reparation payments In May 1929 the Young Plan reduced further payments to 112 billion gold marks In addition the Young Plan divided the yearly payment set at two billion gold marks into two parts one part equal to one third of the sum and could not be postponed and a postponable part for the remaining two thirds 

Because of the Great Depression there was an attempt to delay further payments It failed but in the Lausanne Conference of 1932 it was decided to cancel reparations By this time Germany had paid one eighth of the sum required under the Treaty of Versailles But Germany refused to continue paying upon Hitlers rise to power

Only a few German people accepted that they lost the war The German High Command blamed many civilian parts in the society especially socialists communists and Jews The idea was known as Dolchstolegende The Germans were unhappy with the sum of reparations which seems terrible partly because German leaders could not represent in the decision

The economic problems from the payments was said to be the important factor that led to the end of the Weimar Republic and the beginning of dictatorship of Adolf Hitler John Maynard Keynes a British economist said that this would weaken German economy as well as German politics However many historians disagreed with him Margaret MacMillan a Canadian historian showed her idea that Germany could have paid all the payments if they wanted to She said that the problem was Germany would not like to pay

Sally Marks an American historian also thought that Germany could pay the reparations She said that the Germans paid the reparations in full and on time as long as the French occupied Dsseldorf in 1921 but stopped after the French were no longer stationed there in 1922 Later that year the problem became more serious as French and Belgian representatives urging to occupy Ruhr Area and forced Germany to pay while the British urging to lower the reparations Occupation of the Ruhr began in January 1923 The Allies was quite sure that the German government intended to refuse paying to test if the Allies willed to enforce reparations

As a quiet fight in the Ruhr the German government began the hyperinflation that destroyed the German economy in 1923 In 2008 a British historain Richard J Evans said that the German government was responsible for the hyperinflation as they preferred this to paying reparations The Germans won the worlds pity and after that the French were forced to agree to the Dawes Plan of April 1924 which lowered the reparations Under this new plan Germany paid 1 billion marks in 1924 and reached the total of 225 billion by 1927 After that year Germany was able to pay 25 billion marks per year However the Germans still stop paying the reparations To deal with this the Allies met in a conference in London in July August 1924 and was the first time that Germany challenged the Versailles Treaty

The Germans complained further that payments under the Dawes Plan were too high the Young Plan of 1928 was set up and the Germans were not required to pay higher than 25 billion until 1988 Gustav Stresemann demanded that Rhineland must returned to Germany in order that Germany accept the plan Under strong pressure the French left Rhineland in June 1930

The British historain A J P Taylor wrote that the reparations was harsh enough to be seen as a punishment but not enough to stop Germany from regaining its great power status and can be blamed for the rise of Adolf Hitler

Richard III is a history play written by William Shakespeare It is one of Shakespeares most famous and popular plays Shakespeare probably wrote Richard III around the year 1593 The play was first printed in a book in 1597

Like other history plays written by Shakespeare Richard III is about people and events from earlier in English history The real Richard III was king of England from 1483 to 1485 Shakespeare used the history books of his own time to create his play though many modern experts do not think those early histories or Shakespeares play are accurate and free of bias

Richard III is different from many plays because its leading character is a villain not a hero In his play Shakespeare shows the king as a cruel tyrant who does many evil acts before he is defeated in battle and killed by Henry Tudor Tudor then becomes Henry VII of England the next English king and the first of the Tudor dynasty

Shakespeare lived and wrote before modern ideas of freedom of speech and freedom of the press had become accepted The English government of Shakespeares day practiced censorship of books and plays Elizabeth I of England who has queen from 1558 to 1603 was the granddaughter of Henry VII and the last Tudor ruler Her government saw Richard III as a villain and the man who replaced him Henry VII as a hero and censored any other point of view If Shakespeare had wanted to write a play with Richard III as a hero he would not have been allowed to do so

A famous movie version of Richard III was made in 1955 Laurence Olivier directed the movie and played the leading role Other movie and television versions and many modern stage productions have also been done

Lojban is a made up language that some people speak It is an unusual language because there is no country where everyone speaks Lojban People from all countries learn and speak Lojban only if they want to A person who speaks lojban is called a lojbanist It was first made up by a man called James Cooke Brown in 1955 but the Lojban that people speak now is from a book written by a man called John Cowan in 1997

Lojban is a language that was made after looking at how people speak It works with how people think too to try to make a language that makes it easy to understand what people say

Lojban came from the language Loglan another invented language

The people who created Lojban wanted it to be simple and easy to learn so it only has 1300 main words To make more complex words all you have to do is put main words together If you speak Lojban correctly there is no way for someone else to be confused by what you are saying One of the problems with normal languages like English is that many words have different meanings For instance the English word bat can mean a baseball bat or a type of animal In Lojban each word only means one thing so everyone understands

Here are some examples of words and sentences in Lojban

mie is used when you are telling somebody your name There is no country where everyone speaks Lojban so nobody is born with a name in Lojban But some Lojbanists make up lojban names for themselves that they use Because they know most other people do not speak lojban they usually keep their real name as well and only use their lojban name when speaking to other lojbanists If someone is telling you their real name they usually say mie laoi followed by the name

Oil painting is a way of painting pictures with pigments that are held together by the medium of oil The most usual type of oil that is used in paint is linseed oil A picture that is painted using oil paint is called an oil painting Oil paint takes a long time to dry Artists find this useful because they can keep working on the painting for a long time People say that Leonardo da Vinci worked on his painting of the Mona Lisa for four years even though it is not a very big picture Oils paints and oil paintings are often just called oils for short If someone talks about painting in oils they mean that the painting is done in oil paints

History 

No one knows when oil paint was first used Caves in Afghanistan are decorated with ancient paintings in paint mixed with oils It is believed that this type of paint was used in other countries of Asia as well 

It is believed that oil paint was used in Europe in the Middle Ages at first for decorating shields because oil paint lasted better than the traditional paint of tempera when it was in the weather or if it was roughly treated In 1125 a writer called Theophilus gives instructions for how to make oil paint in his book called On Diverse Arts 

The Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari said that the art of oil painting came from Northern Europe and the person who invented it was the famous Flemish painter Jan van Eyck Artists from the areas of modern Belgium and the Netherlands were the first artists to make oil painting their usual method of painting This trend spread to other parts of Northern Europe A famous painting called the Portinari Altarpiece by Hugo van der Goes arrived in Florence in the 1470s at a time when Leonardo da Vinci was young Oil paintings at this date were usually done on wooden panels in the way that tempera pictures were 

Another influence on oil painting in Italy was an artist from Sicily called Antonello da Messina who had learnt to paint in oils He travelled the length of Italy from Sicily to Venice and did many small paintings including portraits and pictures of the Madonna and Child and Jesus He influenced many artists particularly in Venice Giovanni Bellini who was one of a family of well known painters was one of the first painters in Italy to paint very large pictures in oil paint Artists from other parts of Italy visited Venice and soon the new method of painting spread 

By 1540 there were very few painters who still worked in tempera the previous method for painting on panels In Italy many artists continued to decorate walls and ceiling with fresco However it was discovered that oil paint unlike tempera was flexible This meant that it could be used on flexible surfaces like cloth without breaking away and falling off Once painting on canvas became usual artists were able to do enormous pictures If the painting was too big to fit through a doorway the artist could just roll it up 

Since the 1500s oil painting has remained the favourite technique for artists who want to paint a picture that will last for a long time The gallery below shows works by some of the most famous artists who have worked in oil paint The famous artists of the 20th century are not shown here because their works are copyright Famous Modern artists who have painted in oils include Picasso Matisse Mondrian Chagall Kandinsky Salvador Dali Francis Bacon Lucien Freud Jackson Pollock and Brett Whiteley 

Linseed oil which is the main type of oil used for oil painting comes from the flax seed Flax has been an important crop for thousands of years because linen cloth is made from it This means that the oil for painting and the cloth for painting on both come from the same plant To get different effects artists would use mixtures of different oils These include pine resin frankincense poppy seed oil walnut oil and in more modern times safflower oil 

Artists use turpentine or mineral spirits to thin the paint if they wanted to make a fast drying sketch that they can then paint over in more detail The oil paint on the artists brushes is cleaned out with turpentine after use Modern chemists have made oil paints that can be used with water This makes the clean up job at the end of painting much easier and less smelly Oil paint is usually dry to the touch in a day to two weeks depending on how much oil and turpentine is in it An oil painting is generally varnished when it is finished which gives a slight shine to the surface and protects it A painting should dry for several months before it is varnished An oil painting is not completely dry until it is 60 to 80 years old Varnishing used to be considered an important part of finishing a painting Many modern artists do not varnish their pictures at all

Linen canvas is the traditional surface for an oil painting Cotton canvas can also be used and is cheaper The canvas must be stretched tightly over a frame called a stretcher and fixed into place with little tacks or staples Then it must be treated with a sort of glue called size This is often made from boiled rabbit skins Some artists like to paint on board rather than canvas

Painting an oil painting 

Before an artist can paint on a board or canvas they must prepare it with a ground or undercoat of plain white paint Then the artist can sketch a picture onto the surface using charcoal or paint that is made thin and quick drying with turpentine or mineral spirits The artist often works in a brownish or bluish colour to suggest where the tone will be in the finished painting Then the colours and details are put on in layers 

The good thing about oil paint is that it can be used in all sorts of ways that most other types of paint cannot be used 

Because oil paint can be used in so many different ways it is better than any other type of paint for painting different textures 

The first European artists to use oils liked to make the surface very smooth By the middle of the 1500s some artists like Tintoretto were painting in a much streakier way Rembrandt in the 1600s used the oil paint in all sorts of ways to get different effects He used every technique that is described in the list above After Rembrandt there were always some artists who liked to work in a smooth way and others who used many different ways of putting on the paint This has continued through to Modern times

The Edicts of Ashoka are a collection of 33 broken wikt linkinscriptioninscriptions on the Pillars of Ashoka as well as on large stones and cave walls made by the Emperor Ashoka of the Mauryan dynasty during his reign from 272 to 231 BCE The broken wikt linkedictedicts describe in detail the first wide expansion of Buddhism According to the edicts the extent of Buddhist proselytism during this period reached as far as the Mediterranean and many Buddhist monuments were created

Ashoka did not completely forbid the killing of animals he wanted restraint in the number that had to be killed for consumption protected some of them and in general condemned violent acts against animals such as castration

Proselytism is the practice of attempting to convert people to another opinion and particularly another religion 

The word proselytism comes from the Greek language prefix pros and the verb erchomai Historically in the New Testament the word proselyte meant a person who had converted to the Jewish religion Though the word proselytism was originally used in Christianity it is also used to refer to other religions attempts to convert people to their beliefs or even any attempt to convert people to another point of view religious or not Today the connotations of the word proselytism are often negative

An armistice is the effective end of a war when the parties agree to stop fighting The word comes from the Latin arma meaning weapons and statium meaning a stopping 

A truce or ceasefire usually refers to a temporary stop of hostilities for an agreed limited time or within a limited area A truce may be needed in order to negotiate an armistice An armistice is not the same as a peace treaty which may take months or even years to agree on The 1953 Korean War armistice  is a major example of an armistice which has not yet been followed by a peace treaty 

The United Nations Security Council often demands cease fire of parties in modern conflicts Armistices are always negotiated between the parties themselves and are thus generally seen as more binding than UN cease fire resolutions in modern international law 

The most famous armistice is the Armistice with Germany at the end of World War I on 11 November 1918 signed near Compigne France and effective at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month 

The armistice treaty between the Allies who fought Germany during World War I and Germany was signed in a railway carriage in Compigne Forest on November 11 1918 and marked the end of the First World War on the Western Front Marshal Ferdinand Foch the Allied Commander in chief and Matthias Erzberger Germanys representative were the most important persons who signed it

The Armistice was agreed at 5 AM on November 11 to come into effect at 11 AM Paris time 

Acting German commander Paul von Hindenburg had requested arrangements for a meeting from Ferdinand Foch via telegram on November 7 He was under pressure of imminent revolution in Berlin Munich and elsewhere across Germany 

For the Allies the personnel involved were entirely military

For Germany

General Weygand and General von Gruennel are not mentioned in the document

The peace between the Allies and Germany that followed this armistice was the Treaty of Versailles in 1919

The first SmackDown set was different as it had an oval shaped TitanTron entrance and stage which made it stand out from the RAW set and its rectangular TitanTrons An added feature to the first set was the ability for the OvalTron to be moved to either the left or right of the stage Throughout the shows early existence top WWF superstar The Rock routinely called SmackDown his show in reference to the fact that the name was derived from one of his catchphrases Laying the smackdown In August 2001 as part of celebrating SmackDowns second anniversary the show got a new logo and set The last SmackDown to use the previous television set saw Alliance member Rhyno Gore WWF member Chris Jericho through the center screen destroying part of the set

The Beatles is a 1968 album by the band of the same name The Beatles Its cover included no photographs but was a simple white jacket with the bands name broken wikt linkdie stampdie stamped onto the paper Early copies also included a broken wikt linkserial numberserial number The plain white cover led fans and listeners to call the record the White Album In time even the band and their company Apple Corps began to use this name

The Beatles was the bands twelfth album of new recordings and was released in November 1968 While most albums of the time included ten to fourteen songs The Beatles included thirty four songs and was sold as a two disc set

The Beatles began writing songs for the album while they were in India taking a teaching course in broken wikt linktranscendental meditationTranscendental Meditation taught by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh They planned to become gurus or spiritual teachers and use their music to spread Transcendental Meditation to a wide audience Their helpers back in England looked after their business matters so the Beatles could have time to study and to think about what they learned They released a new single Lady Madonna just before they left for India so they would not be missed by their fans while they were away

Between classes and meditation sessions the Beatles had plenty of free time They brought some instruments with them including acoustic guitars and began to write new songs We wrote tons of songs in India John Lennon later told Playboy magazine Their wives and girlfriends also came along to India Lennon and his wife Cynthia did not spend much time together He would leave alone in the morning to pick up the mail It turned out he was receiving letters and postcards from Yoko Ono a Japanese artist friend and did not want Cynthia to know He said later that while he was in India he began to think about Ono as a woman not just an broken wikt linkintellectualintellectual woman and that he might want a broken wikt linkromanticromantic relationship with her

In the end none of the Beatles finished the course and returned home to England Ringo Starr did not like the spicy food served at the broken wikt linkashramashram where the Maharishi lived and taught and it made him ill He also missed his children Paul McCartney became tired of the long sessions and wanted to return home Lennon and George Harrison heard stories that the Maharishi had broken wikt linkflirtflirted with Mia Farrow and other women at the ashram They did not think this was right for a holy man to do They broken wikt linkconfrontconfronted the Maharishi and later left with their wives to go home deciding the Maharishi was a fraud

The Beatles had formed their own company Apple Corps before they went to India When they returned they went to work full time to make Apple Corps and especially its record label Apple Records a success To raise money the Beatles had signed a new recording contract with EMI the company who owned Parlophone Records which made and sold their records They also made an agreement with EMI for them to market Apple Records

The Beatles needed to record seventy new songs within nine years between 1967 and 1976 to complete their contract They believed that once they delivered those seventy recordings they would be free to go to another record company Between all the songs they wrote in India and their broken wikt linkbacklogbacklog of older songs they knew they could finish the job They recorded demoes of many of the songs at George Harrisons house using his four track tape recorder then began work on the album at Abbey Road Studios in London

The Beatless record producer George Martin thought they should take the best of the India songs and make one especially good album The Beatles instead decided to make a double album with as many songs on it as possible to help finish their contract quickly

The lives of the individual Beatles changed greatly during 1968 and the making of the White Album Paul McCartney was engaged to actress Jane Asher but she came home early one day and found him with another woman Francine Schwartz an American who worked for Apple Corps She and McCartney fought then made up but decided to break up later McCartney also began to use cocaine The drug made him hard to get along with Later in the year he met another woman Linda Eastman an American photographer who had a daughter named Heather McCartney loved children and wanted to start a family while Jane Asher wanted to put her acting career first Linda boasted that she would be proud to have McCartneys children She and McCartney became very close very quickly

John Lennon invited Yoko Ono to his house while Cynthia was away on a vacation with friends one weekend in May The two spent a night together in Lennons attic studio listening to his avant garde recordings and finally making one of their own Lennon discovered Ono was as barmy as I was and that they connected personally in a way he and Cynthia never had They finished the recording and had intercourse as the sun rose that morning They woke up late the next day in love with each other and decided to stay together from then on even though they were both married to other people Lennons wife Cynthia and Onos husband Anthony Cox both took the news very hard with their children caught in the middle

George Harrison had grown as a musician and songwriter and as a celebrity He was the youngest member of the Beatles and always felt under the thumb of Lennon and McCartney They and George Martin limited how many of Harrisons songs the Beatles recorded and turned down many of his songs that other bands would be happy to record This broken wikt linkfrustratefrustrated Harrison Almost nobody outside the Beatles knew about the situation Friends like Ravi Shankar who was Harrisons first real music teacher and Eric Clapton a phenomenal guitarist himself treated him differently Most of the public saw Harrison as an equal with Lennon and McCartney Harrison began to think about making his own music away from the Beatles

Back at Abbey Road Ringo Starr felt out of place during the recording sessions and that he was not needed Paul McCartney had not liked Starrs drumming on a song and re recorded the part himself when Starr was not there This hurt Starrs feelings and he decided to leave the band He stayed home for a week playing with his children and deciding what he should do next with his life The other Beatles missed him and invited him back When Starr returned McCartney and Harrison had covered his drums with flowers and welcome back messages Starr felt loved by his bandmates and stayed

The changes in the bands personal lives showed in their new recordings Instead of sounding like a band working together the songs sounded like solo artists working with a backing group They also began to have problems getting along Lennon brought Ono to the studio whenever he came breaking a rule they had never to bring wives or girlfriends to sessions Ono who was also a musician spoke her mind about how the music sounded and it took everyone else by surprise Harrison also began to speak up more for himself when the band played together

Outside the studio people who worked for the Beatles and the Beatless fans in England did not like Onos influence on Lennon and let the couple know often and sometimes loudly When they attended a play based on Lennons writings the audience broken wikt linkharassharassed the pair asking Wheres your wife John Some members of the public made racist comments about Ono or called her ugly 

Onos new presence in Lennons life even drove a wedge between him and McCartney When the couple stayed at McCartneys house McCartney left Lennon a note that insulted Ono greatly He admitted later it had only been a joke but Lennon felt like he no longer even knew McCartney if he could make such an insult

Neither Lennon nor Ono could believe the way they were treated by the public by people who worked for the Beatles and even by Lennons friends They felt hurt and hated A friend suggested they try heroin to relieve the pain they felt Before long the two were addicted to the drug It caused problems with their health and with how they acted in public

Recording the White Album took much longer than the Beatles normally spent on an album Their label Apple Records was expected to make a big debut over the summer while the album would not be ready until at least that fall In the meantime they recorded songs for a single as their part of the debut Paul McCartney visited Cynthia and Julian at their new home He knew they were hurt by Lennons leaving Cynthia for Yoko Ono and he made up a song for Julian on the way to cheer him up Its words went Hey Jules its not so bad Take a sad song and make it better This turned into Hey Jude which became the Beatless biggest hit single ever and one of the first pop songs to last longer than three minutes

The broken wikt linkB sideB side of Hey Jude was Revolution a song by Lennon in reaction to the Soviet Unions broken wikt linkcrackdowncrackdown on student protests in Czechoslovakia the ongoing war in Vietnam and calls around the world for a revolution against the broken wikt linkstatus quostatus quo He hoped the bands first recording of the song would become their next single but it was rejected as too slow and too long He re recorded the song faster this time lying on the studio floor to give the vocals more punch Hey Jude was seen as a bigger potential hit though so Revolution became the B side The Beatles performed both songs live for an audience and the performances appeared on The David Frost Show in England and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in America

The songs appearing on the White Album included Back In The USSR McCartneys parody of songs by The Beach Boys and Chuck Berry McCartney normally played bass guitar and Lennon rhythm guitar on Beatles recordings but this time McCartney played piano with Lennon switching to bass guitar for the song

Dear Prudence was about Mia Farrows sister Prudence who was also at the ashram in India She spent long stretches of time meditating and almost never came outside Lennon wrote the song hoping to bring her out to spend time with everyone The guitar style he used on the song was the clawhammer a broken wikt linkfingerpickingfingerpicking technique he learned from Donovan another musician who went to India with them

Glass Onion referenced recent songs and events in the Beatless lives and gave a false clue The Walrus was Paul Lennon said later hed given the line as a joke and as a way to say hi to Paul McCartney The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill was about another of the Maharishis students who left the ashram to hunt tigers then returned to meditate Julia was about Lennons mother who had died ten years earlier with images of Yoko Ono whose name means Ocean Child in English

Sexy Sadie was about Lennons disappointment with the Maharishi You made a fool of everyone He changed Maharishi to Sexy Sadie in case the Maharishi really could use some kind of broken wikt linkspiritualspiritual or broken wikt linkcosmiccosmic power against him but later confessed to Rolling Stone magazine who the song was about

Ob La Di Ob La Da was a broken wikt linkretroretro song by McCartney His songs on the album varied from old fashioned to hard rock such as Helter Skelter which was about a broken wikt linkfairgroundfairground ride He also used fingerpicking styles on acoustic guitar and his songs Blackbird and Mother Natures Son included nature themes

While My Guitar Gently Weeps showed Harrisons growth as a songwriter and featured a guitar solo by Eric Clapton It was the first time a guitar solo was played by a non Beatle on a Beatles record Long Long Long was about Harrisons rediscovery of God and spirituality as he became older Savoy Truffle was about a box of Good News chocolate candies which Clapton loved but were harming his teeth

Ringo Starr had tinkered with writing songs but most were just broken wikt linkvariationvariations on songs written by other people Dont Pass Me By was one of his first efforts from years earlier and one of his first to sound original He went on to write many other songs in the years after the Beatles Most were written with a partner Vini Poncia

The strangest recording included on the album was Revolution 9 an avant garde picture of a revolution as it happens as Lennon described later George Harrison helped with ideas and broken wikt linknarrationnarration McCartney and George Martin did not want the track included on the album but Lennon insisted it be used

When the recordings were ready to be mastered Lennon and McCartney spent forty eight hours at Abbey Road Studios working out the running order for the songs on the album They took broken wikt linkstimulantstimulant drugs to help them get through the marathon session The band had done photo sessions during the year but could not agree on any photos to use for the cover They decided to go with a plain white cover which had never been done before They and their helpers made a broken wikt linkcollagecollage of different photos which was included as a poster with the album Portrait photos of each member were also taken Black and white prints appeared next to the song titles on the inner jacket and colour prints were included with the poster They did not appear together in the pictures and this was taken later as a sign that the band was growing apart

The album was completed and scheduled to be released during November 1968 Coming out at nearly the same time were two solo albums by Lennon and Harrison and this caused some problems Harrisons was Wonderwall Music a broken wikt linksoundtracksoundtrack album to the movie Wonderwall by director Joe Massot Harrison had recorded parts of the album in India and parts in England The only other Beatle involved with the album was Ringo Starr who played drums on a few songs and attended the movies broken wikt linkpremierepremiere with Harrison

Lennons album with Ono was Two Virgins edited down from the recording he made with Yoko Ono the first night they were together The cover was a pair of nude photos of the couple and it caused a lot of controversy EMI was willing to master and press the album but refused to print the cover or distribute any copies Apple Records arranged for Track Records a label owned by The Who to issue Two Virgins The album was sold in a plain brown wrapper like pornography and was not a hit Only a few copies were pressed in Britain and more copies were broken wikt linkimpoundimpounded in America than were sold Many people thought Lennon was trying to destroy his own public image releasing such an album In a way they were right He felt that the album was an honest statement of who he really was appearing naked with the woman he loved

Problems aside The Beatles sold well and was another hit for the band The Beatles held a release party and gave early copies of the album to people who attended Older people liked McCartneys traditional sounding songs Younger listeners liked the rock and acoustic songs on the album Many people noticed Harrison and Starrs growth as songwriters and that Harrisons voice sounded freer smoother and more confident than on earlier records

Charles Manson an American would be musician with a small group of followers heard the album in California and thought the songs Blackbird and Helter Skelter were calls for a racial war between African American and Caucasian people His beliefs resulted in a series of murders in Los Angeles during 1969 as he ordered members of his Manson Family to try to spark such a war by committing hate crimes Later during his trial his lawyers tried to get John Lennon or George Harrison to testify but this never happened Manson and four Family members were convicted of multiple murder They were sentenced to be broken wikt linkexecutionexecuted but when the US Supreme Court overturned the death penalty their sentences were changed to life imprisonment None have ever been paroled

During 1969 Allen Klein began to work for the Beatles and for Apple Corps He re read the Beatless recording contract and pointed out that even after the band turned in their seventy new recordings to EMI they were still under contract with them until 1976 and could not go to any other record company until then The fact that they were so close to meeting the requirement though made it possible for him to re negotiate their contract and get them higher royalty payments

The personal problems that had begun to show while the Beatles were making the White Album continued over the next year as did problems with Apple Corps McCartney stopped using cocaine while Lennon and Ono tried to stop using heroin but this did not help mend feelings between the Beatles They finished two more albums Let it Be and Abbey Road but the band broke apart soon afterwards with Paul McCartney announcing in 1970 that he was starting a solo career

In time budget cutbacks resulted in the albums cover no longer being die stamped or numbered but when it was re issued on compact disc early copies were again given serial numbers

Professor Albert Fert is a French physicist who was born on March 7 1938 He discovered giant magnetoresistance which was used to make gigabyte hard disks much easier to build He is a professor at Universit Paris Sud in Orsay and scientific director of a laboratory called Unit mixte de recherche The laboratory is part of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique and Thales Group He was awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics together with Peter Grnberg

Professor Fert graduated in 1962 from the cole Normale Suprieure in Paris He received his masters degree in 1963 at the University of Paris and earned his PhD in 1970 at the Universit Paris Sud

In 1988 Fert discovered Giant magnetoresistance in iron and chromium which began spintronics GMR was also discovered by Peter Grnberg from the Jlich Research Centre but Peter Grnberg did not work with Professor Fert Since 1988 Albert Fert has helped to improve spintronics

Professor Peter Andreas Grnberg is a German physicist who was born on May 18 1939 Professor Grnberg won the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of giant magnetoresistance which made gigabyte hard disk drives easier to produce Half the prize was given to Albert Fert who discovered giant magnetoresistance at the same time but Fert and Grnberg did not work together

Grnberg was born in Pilsen Bohemia which was controlled by the Nazis They called the country the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and it is known now as the Czech Republic Grnbergs father was called Fjodor Grinberg but he changed his name to Fjodor Grnberg in 1941

Professor Grnberg made important discoveries with ferrite and magnetism such as the Giant magnetoresistive effect in 1988 GMR has been used in many modern hard drives Another use of the GMR effect is in magnetic random access memory 

Apart from the Nobel Prize Professor Grnberg has been awarded with shared prizes in the APS International Prize for New Materials the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics Magnetism Award the Hewlett Packard Europhysics Prize the Wolf Prize in Physics in and the 2007 Japan Prize He won the German Future Prize for Technology and Innovation in 1998 and was named European Inventor of the Year in the category Universities and research institutions by the European Patent Office and European Commission in 2006
