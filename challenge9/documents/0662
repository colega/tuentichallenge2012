Geocaching was invented shortly after the removal of artificial error from GPS on May 2 2000 Accuracy of the GPS before this date was about 100m after this date is less than 3m Improved accuracy allowed to specify where the cache is

The first cache was placed on May 3 2000 by Dave Ulmer in Beavercreek It was found by Mike Teague of Vancouver on May 6 2000 The original name of the game is GPS stash hunt but it was changed on May 30 2000 after the discussion of several players to geocaching

The cache is usually in a waterproof plastic container with a logbook where geocachers write their registered nickname and date they find it Larger containers usually contain items for trading like plastic toys hockey cards or special trackable items called Travel Bugs or Geocoins Trackable items are logged on the website and moved from cache to cache

The coordinates of a hidden cache with the rating of the difficulty and terrain and information about size are placed by owner at the official website Geocachingcom After checking by a reviewer they are published and available for other geocachers

 Types of caches  Traditional cache The basic cache type hidden on the place defined by coordinates in header of listing

Multi cache The geocacher usually has to go over the stages find some information at every stage and at finish calculate coordinates of final cache

Mysterypuzzle cache The coordinates of the final cache are usually hidden in some cipher image or text and the geocacher has to discover it

Letterbox hybrid cache A combination of geocaching and letterboxing in the same container Instead of a classic cache there is a stamp which the finder can print to your diary

Webcam cache It is not a typical cache where the geocacher has to find a hidden box with a logbook Instead he has to find a webcam on the published coordinates and take a photo of himselfgranfathered

Virtual cache Similar to webcam cache there is no hidden box at the coordinates The geocacher only has to find out information such as the name on a monument and send it to the owner of the cachegranfathered

Earth cache Very similar to virtual cache but in geographically interesting place The geocacher has to find out answers for the questions in a listing take a photo here and send it to the owner of the cache

Event cache Meeting organized and attended by geocachers There is also special type of event CITO where geocachers have to clean up an area An event attended by more than 500 people is marked as a Mega event

The uncanny valley is a psychological theory about the effect involving art and robots and human emotions As something starts to look more human like there is a point at which people start to feel it look wrong At this point they have bad feelings toward the object These feelings keep getting worse as the object is made to look more human like At a certain point as the object starts to get very close to looking human like peoples feelings towards it tend to reverse and they have better emotional feelings towards it The theory was created by the robotics professor Masahiro Mori in 1970

One of the main points of the theory to explain this is that people are not as affected in an emotional way by the object if it is easy to tell it is not human After a certain point people start to feel emotionally about it but feel bad emotions because it is so nonhuman As it gets closer to looking human they start to feel more positive emotions towards it A graph of these feeling shows a valley This is part of the reason for the naming of the theory

Aggression refers to behavior between members of the same species that is intended to cause humiliation pain or harm

Ferguson and Beaver defined aggressive behavior as Behavior which is intended to increase the social dominance of the organism relative to the dominance position of other organisms

Aggression takes a variety of forms among humans and can be physical mental or verbal

There are two types of aggression  hostile affective aggression and instrumental predatory or goal oriented aggression

Reactive relational aggression is used in response to feeling attacked threatened or mad Usually the person who exhibits this type of aggression feels provoked to do so Instrumental relational aggression is used in order for an individual to get what they want

Predatory or defensive behavior between members of different species is not normally considered as aggression

Like most or even all behaviors aggression can be examined in terms of its ability to help an animal reproduce and survive Animals may use aggression to gain and secure territories as well as other resources including food water and mating opportunities

The most apparent type of aggression is that seen in the interaction between a predator and its prey An animal defending itself against a predator becomes aggressive in order to survive and predator in order to secure food Because aggression against a much larger enemy or group of enemies would be nearly certain to lead to the death of an animal animals have developed a good sense of when they are outnumbered This ability to gauge the strength of other animals gives animals a fight or flight response to predators depending on how strong they gauge the predator to be animals will either become aggressive or flee

Although humans share aspects of aggression with non human animals they differ from most of them in the complexity of their aggression because of factors such as culture morals and social situations

Prequel is a term in drama and literature it means the opposite of sequel When a story is told in several stages it is natural to tell it in order of time For example a series of books on the Second World War started with the 1930s and ended up in 1946 

For various reasons this does not always happen In the film series Star Wars the first film was Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope It was followed by three prequels which were Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones and Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith

For correct use the term prequel is only applied when work is part of a series and when the later publication refers to an earlier time It is an old idea but one which is often used today for drama on film and television The Cypria a work of Ancient Greek literature is a prequel to Homers Iliad A related idea is the back story which is the background story of a main story or character

Sandstone climbing is a kind of rock climbing It came from the Czech Republic This is because there are a lot of sandstone towers there Sandstone climbing has strong rules and tradition

Climbing on sandstone offers a lot of different types of climbing Old classic routes are in chimneys corners and cracks Modern hard routes are in smooth walls around the edges of them in slightly overhanging walls where the climber needs a lot of strength and very good technique in climbing on footholds

If the climber wants to stay alive they must be excellent in putting their own belay on Because sandstone rocks in the Czech Republic are quite soft the climber must use different types of knots on different types of ropes A specific type of knot is a money fist which the climber usually uses for belaying in off width cracks To put knots in cracks correctly the climber needs a branch The climber can put ropes around spikes or around sandclocks The climber can not use iron belays like cam friends or stoppers

The climber can not use chalk to dry their hands They can use the sand wooden sawdust or a mix of both of them

For measure difficulties of climbing in route we use specific grade which came from Saxon In old time this grade was closed This was problem because old routes with no ascent can be VIIc but also IXa and this is really different and very dangerous Now the grade is open so we can use for our routes higher grade up to XIIa But still is true that isnt important grade of route but who and when made the route and character and belay in route

Sandstone rocks we can find in Saxon around river Elbe and in Czech for example Czech paradise Elbe Sandstone or around Adrpach

The town was named after the Native American word for the Kaskaskia River The site of Kaskaskia had been a Native American village for thousands of years In 1703 French Jesuit missionaries started a mission They wanted to change the Illini peoples religion to Catholicism The first stone church was built in 1714 The French also had a fur trading post at the village French settlers came to farm and mine lead on the Missouri side of the river In 1718 Kaskaskia became the capital of Upper Louisiana and a fort Fort de Chartreswas built From its beginning Kaskaskia was a FrenchIndian settlement with a few French men and many Illinois and other Native Americans In 1707 the population was about 2200 Most were Illinois who lived somewhat apart from the Europeans From the French the Native Americans and their mixed race descendants at Kaskaskia came the voyageurs and coureurs des bois They explored and hunted in the Missouri River country The French wanted to trade with all the Prairie tribes and with the Spanish colony in New Mexico This idea horrified the Spanish The explorer Claude Charles Du Tisne set up trade relations with the Plains Indians in 1719

King Louis XV sent a bell to Kaskaskia in 1741 for its church During French rule Kaskaskia and the other farming settlements in the Illinois Country were important for supplying Lower Louisiana especially New Orleans with wheat and corn Farmers sent tons of flour south over the years These staple crops could not grow in Louisianas climate

At first the town had a good site where the Kaskaskia and Mississippi Rivers joined But from St Louis to the junction of the Ohio River the Mississippi became wider and more shallow with more severe flooding Much of Kaskaskia and other French colonial towns have been lost through flooding and erosion Following the Great Flood of 1844 Kaskaskia was rebuilt to the south The original site became an island surrounded by the Mississippi River The flood of 1881 destroyed the original town and the Mississippi shifted into the channel of the Kaskaskia River passing east instead of west of the town Parts of the town were rebuilt in the new area

A map projection is a way of showing the surface of a three dimensional sphere on a plane Such projections are necessary to create maps The problem with projections is that they change the surface in some way this is called distorsion Depending on the purpose of the map some distorsions may be acceptable For this reason there are different map projections that serve different purposes

Carl Friedrich Gauss showed that is not possible to project the surface of a sphere to a plane without distorting it This theorem is known as Theorema egregium today

To understand the projections it is easier to imagine a light source a globe and another geometric object The light source shines a shadow of each point of the globe onto the geometric object At the end the surface of the geometric object is unrolled this yields the map It is possible to tell the projections apart by the type of helper object used

Standard system gearing up or down is provided all its way by bowdens A bowden is special kind of wound steel cable which connects levers with the shifter derailleur or brakes As we pull or tap a lever the bowden reacts at the same time That causes the bicycle to change gear

Electronic shifting works a little like that but there are no bowdens The system is digital That means no wound steel cable but multiple combinations of 0 and 1 provides shifting A battery placed under the frame powers the whole system A battery should last for 1000km then it needs to be recharged Wires for data and powering are hidden inside the frame Parts of the shifting systems are connected together and are powered by the battery Shifting is done by servomotors The shifter and derailleur have a pair of servomotors built inside A microchip in the derailleur gives us freedom It is self adjustable It has its own logic which keeps the chain from dropping There is no need of maintenance because the derailleur adjusts itself thanks to a microchip

The function of 3D television is making a two dimensional screen look like its picture is in three dimensions This effect starts when we observe two shifted displays

Basic division of 3d technologies

3D televisions in shops and e shops are in 90 of cases stereoscopic so we have to use the glasses The glasses divide display into two components

If we want these two components to work we need the 3D transmitter in our TV It is very important for glasses because we need the perfect quality and synchronization 

3D TV can do anything as well as our classic 2D TV but can also play movies in 3D format The newest types of TV even can convert 2D into 3D but the quality is low

Movies in 3D format are still scarce and few people would invest their money into partially exploited machine And here is the question if is better to buy 3D TV today or wait

If we want to enjoy the best 3D image from television its good to get a larger diagonal

For 3D TV one thing is important If we are closer to the screen the experience is stronger Three dimensional image processing is also more difficult for our brains

Because the observation of 3D space in a 3D TV is so hard viewers should be sitting during the watching 3D TV

The peak of mining in Kutn Hora was reached in 14th century During ages there were lots of mines but only few of them have been preserved Last mine was closed during 17th century

Mines were formed by shafts pits going underground Their depth varied from 20 to 150 metres 

Miners worked with simple tools Only 50 dm3 of rock were extracted within a six hour shift This technology allowed them to reach depths ranging from 400 to 450 metres in 14th century The deepest mine in 16th century was the Osel mine which reached the depth of 600 metres

Mine was discovered in 1967 during a hydro geological exploration of the heart of the city Originally it was thought that the legendary Osel mine had been discovered But further exploration proved that it is St George mine

The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was the first successful attempt to establish a democratic and secular republic in the Muslim world The ADR was founded on May 28 1918 after the collapse of the Russian Empire that began with the Russian Revolution of 1917 by the Azerbaijani National Council in Tiflis Georgia Its borders were with Russia in the north Democratic Republic of Georgia in the north west Democratic Republic of Armenia in the west and Persian Empire in the south It had a population of 2 million Ganja was the temporary capital of the Republic as Baku which is the de jure capital was under Bolshevik control

Under the ADR a the government was a parliamentary system in which a parliament called the Milli Majlis elected on the basis of universal free and proportional representation was the highest political institution of state authority and the Council of Ministers was responsible before it Fatali Khan Khoyski became its first prime minister Besides the political party Musavat who had the majority in parliament other political parties were Ehrar Ittihad Muslim Social democrats as well as representatives of Armenian Russian Polish Jewish and German minorities gained seats in the parliament Some members supported Pan Islamist and Pan Turkist ideologies

Among the important accomplishments of the parliament was to give women the right to vote making Azerbaijan the first Muslim nation to give women equal political rights with men Apart from this accomplishment Azerbaijan made these reforms earlier than the United Kingdom and the United States Another important accomplishment of ADR was the establishment of Baku State University which was the first modern type university founded in Azerbaijan

By March 1920 it became clear that Soviet Russia would attack and invade Azerbaijan The Soviet Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin said that the invasion was justified by the fact that Soviet Russia could not survive without the Baku oil fields which was at that time the largest oil field in the world with more than half of the worlds oil reserves According to the common opinion in Moscow Russian Bolsheviks were to help the Baku proletariat in overthrowing the counter revolutionary nationalists meaning the government and the state of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic

After a major political crisis the Fifth Cabinet of Ministers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic resigned on April 1 1920 On April 25 1920 the Soviet Russian 11th Red Army crossed into Azerbaijan entering Baku on April 27 They demanded the closing of the Azerbaijani parliament and set up their own Bolshevik government headed by Nariman Narimanov To avoid bloodshed the members of parliament had to agree with the demand and the ADR officially ended on April 28 1920 giving way to the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic as its successor state The Red Army met very little resistance in Baku from the Azerbaijani army which was tied up on the Karabakh front The first Communist government of Azerbaijan consisted almost entirely of native Azerbaijanis from the left wing political factions of the Hummat and Adalat political parties

In May 1920 there was a major rebellion against the occupying Soviet Russian 11th Red Army in Ganja who wanted to restore the Musavatists to power The rebellion was crushed by government troops by May 31 Leaders of the ADR either fled to the Democratic Republic of Georgia which was the last independent Caucasian country that was invaded in 1921 by Soviet Russia then to Turkey and Iran or were captured by Bolsheviks like Mammed Amin Rasulzade who was later allowed to emigrate or were executed like Gen Selimov Gen Sulkevich Gen Agalarov a total of over 20 generals or assassinated by Armenian terrorists like Fatali Khan Khoyski and Behbudagha Javanshir Most students and citizens travelling abroad remained in those countries never to return again to their country Other important ADR military leaders like the former Minister of Defense General Samedbey Mehmandarov and deputy defense minister General Ali Agha Shikhlinski were at first arrested but then released two months later thanks to efforts of Nariman Narimanov Gen Mehmandarov and Gen Shikhlinsky spent their last years teaching in the Azerbaijan SSR military school

In the end the Azeris did not surrender their brief independence of 1918 20 quickly or easily As many as 20000 died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest However the founding of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic was made easier by the fact that there was a certain popular support for Bolshevik ideology in Azerbaijan among the industrial workers in Baku

Thunderstorms are small broken wikt linkintenseintense weather systems that make strong winds heavy rain lightning and thunder Thunderstorms can happen anywhere with two conditions the air near the Earths surface must be warm and moist and the atmosphere must be broken wikt linkunstableunstable 100 lightning bolts hit the earth every second and at any one moment about 1800 thunderstorms happen around the earth

Usually there are more clouds in the afternoon than in early morning This is because the ground has warmed up enough by the afternoon for strong winds to blow upward from the ground If there is very little moisture an updraft has to go much higher before the water vapor condenses into a cloud Sometimes the air can rise up as high as 5000 to 10000 feet before a small cumulus cloud can condense from the invisible water vapor

High puffy little clouds do not change until a lot of moisture is added This moisture helps the updraft Moisture can add heat which means the cloud will warm up inside and go up even faster The moisture makes the cumulus cloud mushroom upwards and turn into a tall cumulus cloud The winds inside this cloud are very strong Thunder and lightning begins when the top of the cloud is 25000 feet high The inside of the cloud is by this time cold enough so that the water drops are turned into ice crystals A cumulus cloud stops growing when it hits the warm stratosphere Some thunderstorms grow twice as high as Mount Everest

Strong upper winds in the stratosphere smooth and spread the top of the cloud This make the cloud look like the top of a mushroom or an anvil The ice crystals in the anvil cloud give it a fuzzy look As a thunderstorm grows water drops or ice crystals inside the cloud hit and mix with each other getting bigger The bottom of the cloud grows dark with water about to fall When the drops become so heavy that the winds inside the cloud cannot keep them up any more they fall from the cloud as rain or hail Even as they fall the water drops grow by mixing with the smaller drops and makes big raindrops Hail becomes bigger inside the cloud One thunderstorm cloud usually runs out of energy in about 30 to 50 minutes But supercell thunderstorms can last for hours until they dissipate by outflow

Thunderstorms are very active electrically Lightning is a large electrical broken wikt linkdischargedischarge that happens between two opposite charged surfaces

When lightning strikes energy is let out This energy moves to the air and makes air spread quickly and send out sound waves Thunder is the sound that comes from the rapid spread of air along the lightning strike Thunder is slower than lightning because light is faster than sound

Only about 10 of thunderstorms are thought severe Severe thunderstorms cause high winds of more than convert56mphkphfact hail flash floods and tornadoes Hailstorms damage crops damage the metal on cars and break windows Sudden flash floods that happen because of heavy rains is the biggest reason for weather related deaths

Lightning which happens with all thunderstorms makes thousands of forest fires each year in the United States Lightning also kills or injures hundreds of people a year in the United States

Regular thunderstorms begin when warm air near the ground mix with moist air which makes an updraft A severe thunderstorm needs a strong updraft and a strong downdraft A strong updraft is made when firstly the ground is very warm secondly when the air is very moist and thirdly the air above is very cold When the updraft gets stronger so does the thunderstorm

Flash floods happen when slow moving thunderstorms pour down much more water than usual in a small area It rains so hard that the water can not soak into the ground fast enough and the water rushes down the mountainsides or hills into streams and rivers These streams and rivers cannot carry all the water so it quickly floods The most severe flash flood makes the water level rise dangerously in streams dry places or canyons Flash floods can make terrible mud slides and can move very quickly They can roll big rocks tear out trees and destroy buildings and bridges

Flash floods can also happen when two or more thunderstorms hit the same spot one right after the other They can happen when a dam bursts open or ice breaks up Flash floods can also happen when it rains very hard on quickly melting snow

Thunderstorms do not do only damage however they can be a great help to man and all living creatures We get lots of water for many continents during the summer Plants receive lots of life giving rain when they need it Without the thunderstorms many continents would become dry Fish would die crops would fail and animals would perish

Thunderstorms are also our natural air conditioners Hot air at the surface rises up into the high atmosphere where it is put out into space Clouds give us shades and rain can cool down a hot day Without thunderstorms the earth would be as much as 20 F warmer In the summer dust haze and other pollutants come together in the lower atmosphere When the air rises either in cumulus clouds or in thunderstorms spreads the pollution higher up into the atmosphere Rain from thunderstorms washes away many of these pollutants out of the air

Lightning in thunderstorms also helps keep the electrical balance between the earth and the atmosphere Lightning is also fertilizer When it splits through the sky it changes nitrogen gas in the air to nitrogen compounds These fall to the ground and are added to the soil Nitrogen is one of the main ingredients in fertilizer Ten percent of the nitrogen fertilizer needed for farming is made by lightning

So even though thunderstorms are dangerous they can be a great help They give summer water cool the earth and clean the air Lightning balances the earths electricity and helps fertilize the soil And after a thunderstorm sometimes there is a beautiful rainbow

Sacagawea c 1788 probably December 20 1812 was a Lemhi Shoshone woman who went along with the Lewis and Clark Expedition as an interpreter and guide Lewis and Clark explored the Western United States with her travelling thousands of miles from North Dakota to the Pacific Ocean between 1804 and 1806 

Sacagawea is well remembered today When many people think about Lewis and Clark today they also think about Sacagawea

In 2000 the United States Mint issued the Sacagawea dollar coin in her honor showing Sacagawea and her son Jean Baptiste Charbonneau The face on the coin was made to look like a modern Shoshone Bannock woman named RandyL He dow Teton This was because nobody knows exactly what Sacagawea looked like

In 2001 she was given the title of Honorary Sergeant Regular Army by President Bill Clinton

Not much is known for sure about Sacagawea

At about thirteen years of age Sacagawea was taken as a wife by Toussaint Charbonneau a Quebecer trapper living in the village He had also taken another young Shoshone named Otter Woman as a wife 

Sacagawea was pregnant with her first child when the Corps of Discovery arrived near the Hidatsa villages to spend the winter of 180405 Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark built Fort Mandan They interviewed several trappers who might be able to interpret or guide the expedition up the Missouri River in the springtime They agreed to hire Charbonneau as an interpreter when they discovered his wife spoke Shoshone as they knew they would need the help of Shoshone tribes at the headwaters of the Missouri 

Lewis wrote in his journal on November 4 1804 

Charbonneau and Sacagawea moved into the expeditions fort a week later Clark nicknamed her Janey Lewis wrote about the birth of Jean Baptiste Charbonneau on February 11 1805

In April the expedition left Fort Mandan and headed up the Missouri River in pirogues They had to be poled against the current and sometimes pulled from the riverbanks On May 14 1805 Sacagawea rescued items that had fallen out of a capsized boat including the journals and records of Lewis and Clark The corps commanders who praised her quick action named the Sacagawea River in her honor on May 20

By August 1805 the corps had found a Shoshone tribe and was trying to trade for horses to cross the Rocky Mountains They used Sacagawea to interpret and discovered that the tribes chief was her brother Cameahwait

Lewis recorded their reunion in his journal

And Clark in his

The Shoshone agreed to trade horses to the group and to provide guides to lead them over the cold and barren Rocky Mountains The trip was so hard that they were had to eat candles just to live When they went down into the more temperate regions on the other side Sacagawea helped to find and cook camas roots to help them get their strength back

As the expedition approached the mouth of the Columbia River on the Pacific Coast Sacagawea gave up her beaded belt to let the captains trade for a fur robe they wanted to give to President Thomas Jefferson 

On the trip back they came near the Rocky Mountains in July 1806 On July 6 Clark wrote The Indian woman informed me that she had been in this plain frequently and knew it well She said we would discover a gap in the mountains in our direction which is now Gibbons Pass A week later on July 13 Sacagawea told Clark to cross into the Yellowstone River basin at what is now known as Bozeman Pass This was later chosen as the best route for the Northern Pacific Railway to cross the continental divide

While Sacagawea has been thought of as a guide for the expedition she probably only gave directions a few times Her work as an interpreter certainly helped the party to talk with the Shoshone However the most important thing she did for the group may have been being there during the hard journey which showed they did not want to attack any Native Americans they came across While traveling through what is now Franklin County Washington Clark noted The Indian woman confirmed those people of our friendly intentions as no woman ever accompanies a war party of Indians in this quarter and the wife of Shabono our interpeter we find reconsiles all the Indians as to our friendly intentions a woman with a party of men is a token of peace

After the expedition Charbonneau and Sacagawea spent three years among the Hidatsa before accepting William Clarks invitation to live in St Louis Missouri in 1809 

Sacagawea gave birth to a daughter Lizette sometime after 1810 According to Bonnie Spirit Wind Walker Butterfield historical documents say that Sacagawea died in 1812 of an unknown sickness 

As further proof that Sacagawea died in 1812 Butterfield writes An adoption document made in the Orphans Court Records in St Louis Missouri states On August 11 1813 William Clark became the guardian of Tousant Charbonneau a boy about ten years and Lizette Charbonneau a girl about one year old For a Missouri State Court at the time to designate a child as orphaned and to allow an adoption both parents had to be confirmed dead in court papers

Jawa started in 1927 Czechoslovak ammunition factory of Frantiek Janeek started find a new product program because army production was stopped Frantiek Janeek was a scientist inventor and constructor In Czechoslovakia was production of motorbikes only small lot or single part so new production program was chosen in this branch

The name JAWA comes from the first two letters of words Janeek name of the holder and Wanderer name of the Austrian factory which sold licence for first JAWA motorbike Wanderer 500 OHV

In 1932 Frantiek Janeek presented a new motorbike it was Jawa 175 Villiers Licence was bought from England from constructor GW Patchettem It was simple motorbike for today using In Czechoslovakia was very favourite for light weight To 1935 were produced some 3000 motorbikes of this type 

In 1935 the same frame used engine JAWA 350 OHV This motorbike was stronger and more luxury than previous type 175 Villiers There was more chrome parts and a built in speedometer 4000 motorbikes of this type were produced

Most small and youngest motorbike of season before World War II was the Jawa 100 Robot It was a small moped About 12000 were produced

In 1933 Jawa started to produce small cars Ing Janeek bought a licence from German Meisterklasse DKW It was called JAWA 700 To 1934 was produced some one thousand cars of this type because sale was full of small cars so JAWA produced more motorbikes than cars in season before war were motorbikes more favourite

The start of World War II meant the end of motorbike production Lots of motorbikes projects was created illegally but only one realized Jawa 350 Prk After war was produce of motorbikes started again Prk was first motorbike with Czech licence all parts of this motorbike were from Czechoslovakia It was technical a technology miracle of this season 

In 1952 was produced one of travelling motorbike Jawa 500 OHC there was used four stroke engine This motorbike is used by the police and the army 

To the 1960 JAWA cooperated with many countries for example India Turkey Egypt Firm IDEAL MOTORD in Majsur in India bought licences from Jawa mostly 

In 1970 were most produced motorbikes BIZON series and after that was created JAWA 634 which were modernized to model 640 JAWA produced a lot s of models of mopeds for example JAWA 50 types 2021 named pionr or paez This motorbikes were mostly sell in SSSR Jawa 638 640 has engine 350ccm it is robust and favourite motorbike in class motorbike

Today JAWA is sold in many European countries The newest models are JAWA 660 JAWA 125 and 50 Dandy JAWA 250 350 and Basic of motorbikes is really the same like 70 years ago but it is very modernized mainly motors Today stronger four stroke motors are used two stroke motors are used to 350ccm

A computer network is a group of more computers connected to each electronically This means that the computers can talk to each other and that every computer in the network can send information to the others Usually this means that the speed of the connection is fast  faster than a normal connection to the Internet Some basic types of computer networks include

Computers can be part of several different networks Networks can also be parts of bigger networks The local area network in a small business is usually connected to the corporate network of the larger company Any connected machine at any level of the organization may be able to access the Internet for example to demonstrate computers in the store display its catalogue through a web server or convert received orders into shipping instructions

Microsoft Windows Linux and most other operating systems use TCPIP for networking Apple Macintosh computers used Appletalk in the past but it uses TCPIP now

To set up a network an appropriate media is required This can be wired or wireless Twisted pair co axial or fiber optic are examples of cable and infra red blue tooth radio wave micro wave etc are wireless media used for networking When you are working with a mere LAN computers media and peripherals are sufficient But when you are working with a wider range you have use some additional devices like bridge gateway or router to connect different small or large networks And obviously a protocol must be maintained

To set up a network you have to select an appropriate topology to arrange the hardware devices using the media Topologies generally used are bus topology ring topology star topology tree topology object oriented topology etc Among these star topology and tree topology are most popular nowadaysfact

The network communication technology as one complet would be very difficult to implement To simplify it we must implement various layered network models such as ISOOSI All network models are based on the same principle The upper layer use services of the lower one and provide services for the upper one The specific layer can only communicate with the same layer on destination device

OSI is 7 layer network model specified by ISO norm and its widely used all around the world The concept of a seven layer model was provided by the work of Charles Bachman Honeywell information Services Various aspects of OSI design evolved from experiences with the ARPANET NPLNET EIN CYCLADES network and the work in IFIP WG61

 FileAmfm3 en degifthumbright200pxAnalog modulation FM  frequency

The physical layer defines electrical and physical specifications for devices It also specify modulated and baseband transmission

Is transmission of digital data in their raw form This allows very fast and reliable communication over short distance however due to realistic electrical properties of used media the range of baseband transmission is very limited and decreasing with increasing speed Baseband technology is frequently used on LAN

Typical technology Ethernet

In telecommunications modulation is the process of conveying a message signal for example a digital bit stream or an analog audio signal inside another signal that can be physically transmitted The device that provides modulation of baseband signal is called modulator device that provides demodulation of modulated signal back to baseband is called demodulator Today the modulator and demodulator are integrated into one device called Modem Frequently used on WAN WLAN WWAN

Typical technology WI FI ADSL cable TV connection

The data link layer provides the functional and procedural means to transfer data between network entities and to detect and possibly correct errors that may occur in the physical layer

The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences from a source host on one network to a destination host on a different network using the IP adress

An Internet Protocol address is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication At present there are two versions of protocols in use IPv4 and IPv6

The transport layer provides transparent transfer of data between end users providing reliable data transfer services to the upper layers The Transmission Control Protocol and the User Datagram Protocol of the Internet Protocol Suite are commonly categorized as layer 4 protocols within OSI

Commonly united into one layer in simplyfied network models its main purpose is to interact with application encrypting and establishing dedicated connections if necessary

Latency incorrectly called ping is a value that measures how much time packets need to travel to destination It is measured in miliseconds The tool that measures latency is called ping commonly using special ICMP packets which are smaller than standard data packets so they do not weight network by their own

Is value that measures transfer capacity of network and its measured in bits per second today commonly Mbps or Mbs It show us how much data units is transferred each second In present the average bandwidth is far higher than is necessary and it is not a limiting factor in most cases

Broadcast is a special transmission that is not addressed to a single device but to all devices in specific network It is mostly used to automatically issue IP addresses to devices by a DHCP server and to create ARP table that maps the network and speeds up a traffic

A water footprint is the amount of freshwater used by individuals or organizations in order to make goods or provide services used by the community These goods and services may be needed around the entire world A water footprint can be calculated for any well established group of users or producers and it is measured by dividing the total amount of water consumed by the polluted areawhat per unit time While the water footprint of an organization is a positive indicator for water consumption and pollution it does not indicate how other water sources are affected Further studies will need to be conducted in order to determine the effect of the water footprint on water sources

Etymology The water footprint concept was introduced in 2002 by AY Hoekstra from UNESCO IHE as an alternative indicator of water use2 The concept was refined and accounting methods were established with a series of publications from two lead authors AK Chapagain and AY Hoekstra from the UNESCO IHE Institute for Water Education now at WWF UK and University of Twente respectively The most elaborate publications on how to estimate water footprints are a 2004 report on the Water footprint of nations from UNESCO IHE 3 and the 2008 book Globalization of Water by AY Hoekstra and AK Chapagain published by Blackwell 2008 Cooperation between global leading institutions in the field has led to the establishment of the Water Footprint Network in 2008 that aims to coordinate efforts to further develop and disseminate knowledge on water footprint concepts methods and tools

where A is the activity of the chemical species A etc It is conventional to put the activities of the products in the numerator and those of the reactants in the denominator

This is a simple idea In an equilibrium atoms can combine or break apart because the reaction can work in both directions For the reaction to work all of the parts must be present to combine This is more likely to happen if the reactants have a higher concentration So the concentrations of all the necessary pieces are multiplied together to get the probability that they will be in the same place for the reaction Going the other way all of the concentrations of those necessary pieces are multiplied together to get the probability that they will be in the same place to react in the opposite direction The ratio between those two numbers represents how popular each side of the reaction will be when equilibrium is reached An equilibrium constant of 1 means that both sides are equally popular Chemists perform experiments to measure the equilibrium constant of various reactions

Numerical Control is a way to automate machine tools In numerical control the commands these machines get come from a storage medium they are not controlled and operated manually The first such machines were built in the 1940s and 1950s They used punched tape instructions Soon the tools were changed to use computers Numerical control with computers is known as Computerized numerical control or CNC

Nowadays it is possible to make a program that can run on such machine tools based on a CAD drawing of the piece to be produced 

The first attempts to automate machines were done in the 19th century using so called cams These are basically wheels that change the position of notches and can control a machine with this The basix difference to modern NC is that these cams only automated one given task modern NC and CNC machines can be programmed to a greater extent

The Mid Atlantic Ridge is where seafloor spreading takes place in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean It is part of a world wide system of mid ocean ridges These ridges make up the longest mountain range in the world all underwater except for short stretches like Iceland On Iceland the Mid Atlantic Ridge reaches the surface

The ridge separates oceanic tectonic plates and moves the plates apart at about 25 cm per year

The Mid Atlantic Ridge includes a deep rift valley which runs along the middle of the ridge along almost its entire length At the rift the boundary between tectonic plates magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor New magma emerges onto the ocean floor near the ridge axis The crystallized magma forms new crust of basalt and gabbro

The ridge was discovered during the expedition of HMS Challenger in 1872 A team of scientists on board discovered a large rise in the middle of the Atlantic They were planning the future location for a transatlantic telegraph cable The existence of such a ridge was confirmed by sonar in 1925 

In the 1950s mapping of the Earths ocean floors showed the Mid Atlantic Ridge to have valleys and ridges Its central valley is seismologically active and the epicentre of many earthquakes Ewing and Heezen discovered the ridge to be part of a 40000 km long essentially continuous system of mid ocean ridges on the floors of all the Earths oceans The discovery of this worldwide ridge system led to the theory of seafloor spreading and general acceptance of Wegeners theory of continental drift and expansion as plate tectonics

The ridge started forming in at the end of the Triassic period and was responsible for the separation of the Americas from Africa and Europe

The ridge sits atop a geologic feature known as the Mid Atlantic Rise which is a progressive bulge that runs the length of the Atlantic Ocean with the ridge resting on the highest point of this linear bulge This bulge is thought to be caused by upward convective forces in the asthenosphere pushing up the oceanic crust and lithosphere

Metabolism is a kind of architecture that began in Japan around 1960 This way of designing buildings came out of the rebuilding of Japan after World War II Members of the group include Kiyoshi Awazu Noboru Kawazoe Kiyonori Kikutake Kisho Kurokawa Fumihiko Maki Masato Otaka and Kenz Tange They wrote a short book in English and Japanese called The proposals for a New Urbanism for the World Design Conference in 1960 Many Metabolist projects or designs were very large city plans called megastructures The members thought of cities as living things that changed over long periods of time

These architects were interested in building housing for large numbers of people They often planned buildings that could be changed One example is the Nakagin Capsule Tower by Kurokawa Each apartment was a rectangular block with one round window These blocks could be added moved or removed as needed It was a plug in building Kurokawa planned for new better capsules to be added to replace old ones However people living in the tower plan to tear it down and rebuild a larger building 

The Nakagin Kapuseru Taw is a building designed by architect Kisho Kurokawa It has apartments and offices in it The tower is in Shimbashi Tokyo Japan Nakagin Capsule Tower is an example of the Metabolism style of architecture It was the first modular capsule building

The building is actually two towers One is eleven and the other is thirteen floors These towers are the utility cores They have the elevators stairs electric and water services in them They also support the whole building 140 capsules are attached to the two cores Each capsule unit is one apartment or office They are convert23mftabbron convert38mftabbron convert21mftabbron and have one round window Just four bolts connect each unit to a tower The units are lightweight steel They were built in Shiga Prefecture and brought to Tokyo on trucks The capsules are not connected to each other so any capsule can be removed or replaced without moving the others

The towers are the permanent part of the building and the capsules were temporary Kurokawa planned for new units to be built to replace old ones As building technology improved better units could be added Also units could be changed as people moved in or out Capsules could even be moved from one building to another This part of the plan never happened No new capsules were ever built

Residents plan to tear down the building They say there are problems with asbestos and that the building is too old and hasnt been repaired well Kurokawa and other architects want to keep the building as an historic example

Gas discharge lamps are a family of artificial light sources These lamps produce light by sending electricity through a ionized gas Most of these lamps use a noble gas or a combination of noble gases but they often contain other materials such as mercury sodium or metal halides The gases in these lamps are ionized in operation This means that there are free electrons When a electric current is sent through the gas electrons collide with atoms of the gas and the metals This will mean that some reach a higher energy state When they fall back into the lower energy state they will emit the energy in the form of light 

The fluorescent lamp is probably the best known gas discharge lamp

Gas discharge lamps have a long life and a high efficiency but they are more complicated to manufacture which makes them more expensive to buy than incandescent lamps Due to their greater efficiency gas discharge lamps are replacing incandescent lights in many lighting applications 

A charged particle also called an ion is an atom with a positive or negative charge This happens whenever something called an ionic bond forms Two particles that have different numbers of electrons start reacting to each other The particle that has the greater amount of electrons steals the other particles electrons One becomes positive because it lost an electron and the other negative because it got another electron The two particles become attracted to each other and mix together making a new kind of particle

A Germicidal lamp is a lamp that produces a special type of ultraviolet light This light can ionise oxygen and produce ozone Ozone can kill many types of germs There are different designs of such lamps some are very similar to compact fluorescent lamps

The Royal House of Pandolfi was founded in the middle of the ninth century AD by Count Landolfo I of Capua in the year 840 It would be by the fruits of his labor and bravery that would give rise to a powerful Italian and Mediterranean dynasty that would in under less than one hundred years after coming to power control politically and economically most of Southern Italy 

Originally the Pandolfis were of Lombard origin coming from what is present day Eastern Germany It is believed that the family had possibly migrated to Italy with the Lombard Army as it made its way down the Italian Peninsula during the time of late antiquity It was not until later that the family settled as lords of Capua most likely as vassals to the Lombard Duchy of Benevento The family first ruled in Capua as Counts and then finally in 887 AD as Sovereign Princes In the beginning of the tenth century AD the Pandolfi family under the grand leadership of Sovereign Prince Atenolfo I united most of the lands of Southern Italy into one state under one royal crown forming the Principality of Capua Benevento It could be said also that the Pandolfis are possibly one of the oldest royal familiesdynasties in Italy and in Europe They ruled as Sovereigns from the middle of the ninth century AD till the familys downfall and overthrow in 1098 AD at the hands of the Normans In all the Pandolfi family and dynasty ruled for a total of 244 years 

During this extensive period of time some of the most well known and notable members of the Pandolfi familyincluded Count Landolfo I of Capua Count Landolfo II of Capua Count Pandenolfo of Capua Sovereign Prince Atenolfo I of Capua Benevento Sovereign Prince Pandolfo I of Capua Benevento Blessed Pope Victor III of Rome papacy from and Sovereign Prince Landone IV of Capua 

It was during the reigns of Sovereign Princes Atenolfo I and Pandolfo I of Capua Benevento that the family and dynasty reached the peak of its splendor and power in the Mediterranean World The realm ruled by the Pandolfi family included what is today parts of Apulia Basilicata Calabria Campania and Molise In 909 AD as a gift of thanks for the familys diplomatic and military support against Islamic expansion into the Mediterranean Sea Basin the Eastern Roman Emperor Leo VI awarded the hereditary Byzantine titles of Anthpatos and Patrikios to the male members of the family and dynasty The family would officially hold these titles until the collapse of the Byzantine Empire in 1453 at the hands of the Ottoman Turks 

The Pandolfis were not only Sovereigns but also outstanding members of society with some members of the family and dynasty taking up religious and monastic aspirations such as Prince Dauferius who later became Blessed Pope Victor III of Rome However at the same time there were the Pandolfi Counts and Sovereign Princes of the family who were absolute monarchs and warriors and thus commanders of their vast armies Members of the Pandolfi dynasty not only bravely served their family but also fought to strengthen the State of the Principality of Capua Benevento and the other lands under their domain by fighting for their countrys independence The Royal House of Pandolfi did not just give Southern Italy extraordinary political stability during its 244 year rule but also military leaders statesmen and politicians who all made significant achievements in the areas of diplomacy

Throughout history the institution of monarchy has often stood as a testament to the common bond between the people and their Sovereign The monarch regardless of his title was a symbol of faith hope peace and prosperity and the Pandolfis where no less responsible to their people 

The Pandolfi dynasty lost its grip on power during the eleventh century AD when it was overthrown by the Norman Prince Richard II of Aversa in 1098 Even with the loss of all its territory at the hands of the Normans the Pandolfi family still somehow managed to stay afloat all the way into the modern era 

This Royal House still exisit today having branches in the modern Republic of Italy and in the United States of America The American branch of the Royal House of Pandolfi is currently headed by His Serene Highness Ernest Christopher Konstantine Pandolfi Titular Hereditary Prince of Capua Benevento and Salerno Duke of Camerino and Spoleto Count of Teano and Aquino Hpatos of Gaeta and Naples and Anthpatos and Patrikios of Byzantium

Hurricane Juan in 1985 was the most costly of all the storms of the hurricane season It killed around 24 people and caused about 15 billion in damage even though it was a weak hurricane Even though the damage was bad the name Juan was not removed from the list of hurricane names in the spring of 1986

Hurricane Hortense cut across Haiti the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico in September of 1996 The storm took next to 40 lives and did 139 million in damage The storm also affected portions of eastern Canada striking southeastern Nova Scotia as a Category 1 hurricane The name Hortense was later retired

In ballistics the ballistic coefficient of a bullet is a measure of its ability to overcome air resistance in flight A high BC means the object will slow down less It will have more of its speed left when it reaches the target BC depends on mass diameter and drag coefficient Ballistic coefficient has units of lbin or kgm BCs for bullets are normally stated in lbin by their manufacturers without referring to this unit The values for BC can be as low as 012 and as high as 100 for commonly used bullets

A bullet with a high BC will travel farther than one with a low BC since it will keep its speed better resist the wind better and shoot flatter

When hunting with a rifle a higher BC is good for several reasons A higher BC results in a flatter flight The effect of mistakes in estimating the distance to the target is smaller for bullet with a higher BC This is important when attempting an effective hit on a game animal If the target animal is closer than estimated then the bullet will hit higher than expected On the other hand if the animal is further than estimated the bullet will hit lower than expected Such a difference in bullet drop can make the difference between a clean kill and a wounded animal

This difference in flight path becomes more important at longer distances Sometimes the difference in two bullet designs fired from the same rifle can result in a difference between the two of over 30 cm at 500 meters A bullet with a high BC arrives at the target faster and with more energy than one with a low BC Since the higher BC bullet gets to the target faster it is also less affected by crosswinds

Sporting bullets have BCs in the range 012 to slightly over 100 with high being the most aerodynamic and low being the least Very low drag bullets with BCs 110 can be designed and produced on special lathes using mono metal rods These special bullets often have to be fired from custom made full bore rifles with special barrels

Bullet makers often offer several weights and types for a given size Heavy for caliber pointed bullets with a boat tail design have high BCs Lighter bullets with square tails and blunt noses have lower BCs 

In the United States hunting cartridges such as the 25 06 Remington the 270 Winchester and the 284 Winchester are used when high BCs are desired In the larger sizes the 338 Lapua Magnum and the 50 BMG are popular with very high BC bullets for shooting beyond 1000 meters They have very high BCs Other choices in the larger size are the 375 and 408 Cheyenne Tactical and the 416 Barrett

Differences in BC claims for exactly the same projectiles can be explained by differences in the air density used for these BC statements or differing range speed measurements on which the stated G1 BC averages are based The BC changes during a projectiles flight and stated BCs are always averages for certain distances and speeds Some more explanation about the transient nature of a projectiles G1 BC during flight can be found at the external ballistics article This article suggests that knowing how a BC was established is almost as important as knowing the stated BC value itself

To find the correct BC Doppler radar measurements are required The normal shooting or aerodynamics person however does not have this expensive equipment Weibel 1000e Doppler radars are used by governments professional ballisticians defense forces and a few ammunition manufacturers to get exact real world data on the flight behavior of projectiles of interest

Test results came from many shots not just a single shot Any single bullet can have a very different BC than another It is important to know the average behavior of a bullet How different speed regimes affect several rifle bullets made by Lapua can be seen in the 338 Lapua Magnum product brochure which states Doppler radar established BC data

Most ballistic mathematical models and hence tables or software assume that one specific drag function correctly describes the drag and hence the flight characteristics of a bullet related to its ballistics coefficient Those models do not have any differences for wadcutter flat based spitzer boat tail very low drag etc bullet types or shapes However some different drag curve models have been made for several standard projectile shapes

These free computer programs can be used to calculate ballistic coefficient if other information is known

Carmen Amaya was a flamenco dancer and singer of gypsy origin born in the Somorrostro slum of Barcelona Spain 

She has been called the greatest Spanish gypsy dancer of her generation and the most extrardinary personality of all time in flamenco dance

She danced from the time she was 4 years old Accompanied on the guitar by her father she danced in waterfront bars in Barcelona A young person who saw her dance as a girl was the Spanish guitarist Sabicas He later said I saw her dance and it seemed like something supernatural to me I never saw anyone dance like her I dont know how she did it I just dont know Sabica accompanied her for many years He recorded Queen of the Gypsies and Flamenco with Amaya

In 1929 she made her debut in Paris to warm acclaims and admiration of her dancing skill She moved to America in 1936 where she went on to act in several films that broke box office records including the Romeo and Juliet adaptation Los Tarantos and the short film Danzas Gitanas 

One thing was strange about her she often danced in trousers rather than the layered skirt traditional for female flamenco dancers One theory is that she did this to give more scope to her footwork which was exceptional and rather like a flamenco male dancer Apparently in early flamenco women did not do so much footwork and male dancers usde to fill in the steps while sitting on chairs unseen in the wingsp100 Her style has been described as repetitive because she always did the same dances Carmen was a fabulous dancer but limited

She was invited by Franklin Roosevelt to dance in the White House in 1944 and also by Harry S Truman in 1953

Amaya is buried in the Cementiri del Sud Oest on Barcelonas Montjuc

Zork was originally MIT hacker slang for an unfinished program The creators named the completed game Dungeon but changed it back to Zork after receiving a trademark violation notice from the publisher of Dungeons Dragons Zork has also been adapted to a book series

Three of the original Zork programmers joined with others to found Infocom in 1979 That company adapted Zork into Zork I III a trilogy of games for most popular small computers of the era Personal Software published what would become the first part of the trilogy under the name Zork when it was first released in 1980 but Infocom later handled the distribution of that game and their later games Part of the reason for splitting Zork into three different games was that at the time micros did not have enough memory and disk storage to handle the entirety of the original game In the process more content was added to Zork to make each game stand on its own A version of Zork I was issued as a hidden easter egg in Call of Duty Black Ops It has exactly the same text and rules as the original

Zork is set in the ruins of an ancient empire lying far underground The player is a nameless adventurer who is venturing into this dangerous land in search of wealth and adventure The goal is to return from the Great Underground Empire alive with the treasures ultimately inheriting the title of Dungeon Master The dungeons are stocked with many novel creatures objects and locations among them grues zorkmids and Flood Control Dam 3all of which are referenced by subsequent Infocom text adventures 

FrobozzCo International is a fictional monopoly from the game  FrobozzCo products are littered throughout all Zork games often with humorous effect

The neusis is a geometric construction method that was used by ancient Greek mathematicians At that time people did not have good rules to measure distances They did not know algebra So they studied geometry by moving fixed length sticks around on a piece of paper

The neusis construction fits a line element of given length in between two given lines in such a way that the line element or its extension passes through a given point P That is one end of the line element has to lie on l the other end on m while the line element is inclined towards P

A neusis construction might be performed by means of a Neusis Ruler a marked ruler that is rotatable around the point P In the figure one end of the ruler is marked with a yellow eye with crosshairs this is the origin of the scale division on the ruler A second marking on the ruler indicates the distance a from the origin The yellow eye is moved along line l until the blue eye coincides with line m The position of the line element thus found is shown in the figure as a dark blue bar

Point P is called the pole of the neusis line l the directrix or guiding line and line m the catch line Length a is called the diastema

Neuseis have been important because they sometimes provide a means to solve geometric problems that are not solvable by means of compass and straightedge alone Examples are the trisection of any angle in three equal parts or the construction of a regular heptagon Mathematicians such as Archimedes of Syracuse freely used neuseis Slowly the Greeks stopped using it

T L Heath the historian of mathematics thought that the Greek mathematician Oenopides was the first to put compass and straightedge constructions above neuseis Hippocrates of Chios may have spread the idea that mathematicians should avoid neuseis whenever possible He came from the same island as Oenopides and who wasas far as we knowthe first to write a systematically ordered geometry textbook One hundred years after him Euclid also said bad things about neuseis in his very influential textbook The Elements

The next attack on the neusis came when from the fourth century BC Platos idealism gained ground Under its influence a hierarchy of three classes of geometrical constructions was developed Descending from the abstract and noble to the mechanical and earthly the three groups were

In the end the Greek mathematicians thought that using a neusis was acceptable only when the two other higher groups of constructions did not offer a solution Neusis became a kind of last resort that was invoked only when all other more respectable methods had failed Using neusis where other construction methods might have been used was branded by the late Greek mathematician Pappus of Alexandria as a not inconsiderable error

The acute accent is a mark in many written languages It is usually added to the top a vowel to show how to say it Acute accents are sometimes added to consonants too Sometimes the acute accent changes the sound of the whole word by giving it stress in a sentence This accent is part of many modern languages that use Latin Cyrillic and Greek alphabets The acute accent is one of many similar marks called diacritics

The acute accent was first used in Ancient Greece It told the speaker when to say a syllable with a high pitch Another early accent mark was the apex In Latin the apex marked long vowels

The acute accent is mainly used to tell readers about the sound of vowels in words Sometimes it is very important to the meaning because it shows the difference between two similar words For example resume may mean to start again but rsum is a summary of someones work and school experience Some languages use the accent to show the same changes in sounds but others use it differently The acute accent may show

Some languages use the accent to actually make new letters Both Faroese and Icelandic add the acute accent to all of their vowels to make new letters These letters   and are separate letters with different pronunciations In Turkmen the letter is a consonant j

Many languages have borrowed words from French Many Norwegian words which came from French keep an acute accent Some examples are all kaf id komit Swedish examples include caf and resum Examples in English include attach canap clich communiqu caf dcor fianc pass toupe and touch However sometimes writers forget or choose not to use the accent mark

Some languages such as Arabic Persian or Japanese do not use alphabets Some writers use the acute accent to tell how the words should sound when words from these languages are written in English This is more common in older books and less common today

The ISO 8859 1 and Windows 1252 character encodings included    They also had how letters and accents looked when they were written as capital letters Unicode has many more letters with the acute accent

To make an accented letter in a Microsoft Office software users hold the ctrl key and press the apostrophe key once Then let the ctrl key go and press the letter they wantfactdateDecember 2011

On Apple Macintosh computers users press option e and then the vowel Vowels can also be capitalised For example users make by pressing option e and then a Pressing Option e and then Shift a makes 

On Wikipedia users make these symbols by clicking on a link in a box Some other websites work the same way

Sonitpur is a major district of Assam India

The name Sonitpur as well as Tezpur literally means the city of blood 

It reminds of the romantic legend of Usha and Anirudha  The legend revolves around Banasura the great Asura king of ancient Tezpur  his beautiful  daughter Usha  and her  friend Chitralekha The princess saw a handsome prince in her dreams and fell in love with him  Chitralekha a talented artist  not  only  painted  his  portrait  from  Ushas description  but recognised him to be Aniruddha the grandson of Lord Krishna and ruler of Dwarka Using her magical powers Chitralekha spirited Aniruddha away to the princess boudoir where the two married each other according to Gandharva rites without the knowledge of the king  When  Banasura  learnt  of the clandestine romance he imprisoned  Aniruddha which led to the arrival of Lord Krishna  to rescue his grandson A fierce battle followed and the entire city was drenched in human blood hence the name Sonitpur or Tezpur ie the city of blood                                            The story of eternal love between Usha and Aniruddha finds expression in many stories novels dramas dance dramas movies

Sir Edward A Gait had made reference to the nine line inscription of Harjjar Varma in his A History of Assam The inscription is the first recorded history of Assam and dates back to 829 AD The inscription was found engraved on a massive

stone some two kms away from Tezpur town situated near a temple called Rudrapad

Salastambha dynasty ruled Kamrupa from seventh to Tenth century AD The accurate boundary of their kingdom is debatable But the erstwhile Darrang was certainly a part of the kingdom They shifted their capital from Pragjyotishpur to Haruppeswara or Hatappeswara the present day Tezpur The famous King of the dynasty Harjjar Varma besides other things had excavated a large pond in 70 acres of land later came to be known as Hajara PukhuriPal dynasty ruled Haruppeswara till the 12th century The most famous ruler of the Pal dynasty was Brahmapal

After the Pal dynasty the royal dominance of the Koch Kings in the west and the Ahoms in the east started growing During the 14th and 15th century a large part of the western bank of Brahmaputra from Singri in the west and Sootea in the east was ruled by the Bara Bhuyans The great saint poet Sri Sri Shankardeva belonged to Bara Bhuyan family who settled at Rowta in Darrang District The Ahom King Suhungmung alias Dihingia Raja occupied the territories of the Bara Bhuyans on the north in 1505 ADThe Koch King Biswa Sinha rose to power in 1515 AD King Naranarayana who ascended the thorne in about 1540 A D divided his Kingdom into two parts He had given the eastern part to the son of his brother Chilarai and the western part of the kingdom to his own son Lakshminarayana But soon after their ascension as kings fatricidal war broke out and Lakshminarayana sought refuge with the Mughals which eventually led to invasion of Kamrup by the Mughals Balinarayana one of the brothers of Pariksitnarayana fled away to Gorgaon to seek the help of the Ahom king Swargadew Pratapsingha Pratapsingha christened Balinarayana as Dharmanarayana made him the king of Darrang and declared war against the the Mughals The Ahoms defeated the mighty Mughals in the Bharali war and re occupied Darrang from the Mughals King Dharmanarayana made supreme sacrifice in Singari war in 1638 His son Sundarnarayana ascended the throne and became the king of Darrang On the otherhand the Ahoms ruled the eastern part of Darrang through Kalia Bhomora Borphukan stationed at Kaliabor The Ahom Kings resettled many people in the southern part of Brahmaputra

The British annexed the then Assam into the Indian British Empire in 1826 After1826 the Lower Assam and the Central Assam were made one division which extended up to Biswanath The division was placed under one Administrative Officer designated as the Principal Assistant to the Commissioner The Upper Assam portion was left to the native rulers with supervisory control under a British political agent with political headquarters at Biswanath Captain Neufville was the political agent for Upper Assam Darrang Division was administered till 1833 from Guwahati

Darrang was converted into a district and Mangaldai was made the district Headquarter in 1833 But due to various reasons the British shifted the head quarter to Tezpur in 1835 The district comprised of two sub divisions Tezpur sadar sub division and Mangaldoi sub division with head quarter at Mangaldoi The District of Darrang was divided in to six Revenue Circles under one Sub Deputy Collector in each Circle There was one Transferred area in the district at Charduar An Asst Political Officer was posted at Charduar under the Deputy Commissioner who acted as Political Officer

Tezpur was a small township then The British developed Tezpur as a small garrison township Later tea gardens were set up throughout the district The old steamarghat at Jahajghat the Dak Bungalow the then Chummery compound at present Don Bosco School campus the Planters Club of Tezpur the Jahajghat Railway Station the Church of Ephiphany etc and many tea gardens are some of the examples of the contributions of the British

There is no specific information about the alignment of the people of the district in the earlier struggle for liberation waged by the princely and upper class people in Upper Assam from 1828 to 1857 But with the spread of western education during the last part of the 19th century a new awakening surcharged the patriots of the land

Few years before the birth of the Indian National Congress in Bombay in 1885 the Tezpur Ryot Sabha was formed by a group of enlightened people primarily to protest against the enhancement of land revenue and to ventilate other public grievances 

The Tezpur Ryot Sabha sent Kali Krishna Barkakoti to as its delegate to the National Congress in 1885 It had played an active role in early period of the freedom struggle

The All Assam Student Association formed in 1916 worked in the district under the leadership of Chandra Nath Sarma

In June 1921 the Tezpur District Congress Committee was formed under the presidency of Chandra Nath Sarma

In August 1921 Mahatma Gandhi visited Tezpur and recorded his impression of the visit in Young India in the article From the Bank of Brahmaputra 

In 1934 Mahatma Gandhi visited Tezpur again during the course of Civil Disobedience Movement

In the final phase of British Period the Quit India Movement gained momentum with the slogan Do or Die in places like Tezpur Sootea Gohpur Dhekiajuli and Jamuguri

On 10th September 1942 at Gohpur a young girl led a procession of unarmed villagers under Congress flag She was Kanaklata Barua  a girl from Barangabari village As soon as Kanaklata unfurled the flag she and her companion Mukunda Kakati were gunned down by the armed Police The saga of her heroic sacrifice is still remembered with pride

On the same day at Dhekiajuli Police Station eleven unarmed villagers were gunned down by the armed Police while trying to hoist the tri color at the Police Station  three of them were teen aged girls Tileswari Numali and Khahuli 

Finally the British era had come to an end on 15th August 1947 when India gained her Independence in the midnight of 14th August

The administration set up by the British continued even after Independence Darrang district with head quarter at Tezpur continued as an impotant district of Assam 

Towards 1961 Tezpur started to become a center of Trade and Commerce A year later in 1962 war broke out with China The Chinese Army advanced up to Sessa near Bhalukpung People started fleeing from their homes The war had left a bitter experience in the minds of the people of the district

In 1983 Darrang district was bifurcated Tezpur sadar sub division was named as Sonitpur district with an outlying Sub Division at Biswanath Chariali Mangaldoi sub division was named as Darrang district

On 15th August 2000 another Sub Division namely Gohpur Sub Division was carved out from the erstwhile Biswanath Sub Division

Two major events in the field of communication and education can be cited as landmarks in post independence history of the district The first one being the construction of Kalia Bhomora Bridge and its inauguration on 14th April1987 by Rajiv Gandhi the then Prime Minister of India The second one is the establishment of a Central University at Napaam named as Tezpur University

In the cultural front one can very well name the trio of Assamese culture who were born in the district The post independence era had seen their talents flourishing which had not only enriched the cultural horizon of the district but has also contributed to formation of a composite Assamese culture

Didcot Power Station refers to a combined coal and oil power plant and a natural gas power plant that supply the National Grid They are right next to one another in the civil parish of Sutton Courtenay next to the town of Didcot in Oxfordshire in the UK The combined power stations feature a chimney which is one of the taller structures in the United Kingdom and six hyperbolic cooling towers which can be seen from much of the surrounding area

This was the first power station here It is the biggest one with the big cooling towers that are in two groups One group is northwest the other group is southeast The power station can make up to 2000 megawatts at any one time Didcot A mainly burns coal but can also burn oil or in some cases gas This power station can use some biomass such as wood The fuel is first ground up in big mills if it is solid to give it a large surface area and is then blown into a large boiler with lots of air Here it is burnt to make very high pressure steam which is used to turn a large steam turbine This turbine is connected to a generator which makes the electricity that is then sent out on the Naitional Grid

This is the second power station in Didcot and is run only on gas It can put out almost 1500 megawatts and uses gas turbines and steam turbines together to be more efficient This is called combined cycle gas turbines It has smaller cooling towers that cant be seen as easily but that make a more obvious cloud that appers to come from the ground

Samgyetang is Korean ginseng chicken soup Its a very healthy food during the summer especially on the three days called bok days

Samgyetang is made of a whole young chicken stuffed with sticky rice ginseng jujube garlic and ginger The chicken is closed shut and cooked in a soup The richness of the broth depends on the style of the cook as is the added ingredients that may be added Some Samgyetang broths are cooked for hours This broth is added to the chicken cooking separately to create a very rich soup Other broths are lighter and clear Its a matter of preference

Samgyetang is usually served with salt and pepper which is put in a small separate dish to dip the meat Some people like to add the seasoning directly into the soup It is usually served with kkakdugi and some restaurants will offer regular kimchi as well

Sesame oil is a vegetable oil made from the sesame plant It is used a lot in Asian cooking

The English term sesame traces back to the Arabic simsim Coptic semsem and and early Egyptian semsent Semsent was listed in the Ebers Papyrus a 65 feet long scroll listing ancient herbs and spices discovered by the famous German Egyptologist Ebers The earliest recorded use of a spice  sesame seed  comes from an Assyrian myth which claims that the gods drank sesame wine the night before they created the earth Sesamum indicum is native to the East Indies Usage dates back to 3000 BC Over 5000 years ago the Chinese burned sesame oil not only as a light source but also to make soot for their ink blocks African slaves brought sesame seeds which they called benn seeds to America where they became a popular ingredient in southern dishes Through the ages the seeds have been a source of food and oil Sesame seed oil is still the main source of fat used in cooking in the Near East and Far East

Good sesame oil has a strong smell when it is opened The color should be bright brown or gold It should be kept at convert18to22CF If it is too cold the oil would be solid and lose its smell Sesame oil can go bad if it is exposed to air and sunlight Therefore it is better kept on a shelf or a sideboard A dark brown bottle is better than a plain one because the brown one can protect the oil from the sunlight better The bottle should be closed tightly to keep air out

Many things affect the price Oil content is the most important Usually a bottle of sesame oil has 4055 The more oil content it has the higher price it has Another element is country of origin Also if you buy it made from a factory it would cost less than oil made in a country house by a farmer

A grist mill consists mainly of a waterwheel and 2 stones for grinding grain into flour Water pushes the wheel causing it to spin This movement causes an axle inside to turn The axle is connected to a gear which causes the grinding stones to spin At the top there is a chute filled with grain The grain slowly falls through into the grinding stones

The painting The Kiss is the work painted by Gustav Klimt He began to paint it in 1907 and it is one of the famous works in his Golden Period The sterreichische Galerie Belvedere museum in the Belvedere palace in Vienna Austria is exhibiting the painting

The painting shows a couple embracing each other with gold leaf on canvas The man is kissing the woman who has green hair Klimt has said he had obsession for the woman with redheads and it was reflected in the woman in his painting

The man and woman are on a flowery grassland According to the psychoanalytical and biological distinction Klimt expressed them in different ways The man wearing a robe with black white and gray rectangles is described in a rough way while the woman is expressed with the smooth figures such as a circle a curve and flowery patterns Her hair is also combined with flowers it looks like she is surrounded with flowers On the contrary the part outside the couple in the painting is filled with flat patterning which has small gleaming dots 

The Kiss represents fin de siecle spirit because it shows a decadence through opulent and sybaritic images Also the painting has some styles recalling the arts of other period Of them by using gold leaf the painting reflects medieval gold ground paintings and earlier mosaics and the spiral patterns in the clothes recall Bronze Age art

In the Kiss Klimt portrays woman as the femme fatale who is a beautiful woman attracting men sexually but brings them unhappiness It is said that the woman modeled for the painting however his life companion Emilie Flgewho participated as the Viennese bohemian and fin de siecle circles like Klimt

Appendages are parts of animals attached the main body Many arthropods have appendages on each or most of their segments Millipedes for example have many segments and almost all carry two legs Insects have exactly six legs two on each segment of the thorax Antennae attached to their heads are another type of appendage

Wings parts of the tail legs some mouthparts external sex organs can all be described as appendages

Appendages may be uniramous as in insects and centipedes where each appendage comprises a single series of segments or it may be biramous as in many crustaceans where each appendage branches into two sections 

All arthropod appendages are variations of the same basic structure Which structure is produced is controlled by homeobox genes Changes to these genes have allowed scientists to produce animals with modified appendages such as legs instead of antennae

This is a list of political parties in Azerbaijan

Azerbaijan is a one party dominant state meaning that is a system of majority rule where one political party in this case the ruling New Azerbaijan Party has successively won election victories by a very large majority and is therefore the dominant ruling party which does not have to form coalitions with other smaller political parties as a result The one party dominant state differs from a one party state because opposition parties against the New Azerbaijan Party are allowed but are widely considered to have no real chance of gaining power 

The one party dominant state is a system of majority rule where one political party has successively won election victories by a very large majority and is therefore the dominant ruling party which does not have to form coalitions with other smaller political parties as a result 

The one party dominant state differs from a one party state because opposition parties against the dominant ruling party are allowed but have no real chance of gaining power 

Many one party dominant states are dictatorships where only one party can by law be in control but some one party dominant states are real democracies where there are no limits by law against other parties

A case of this was Mexico where Presidential candidates of the Institutional Revolutionary Party were popularly elected for more than 70 years

The neng Tensh means Heavenly Virtue

Oda Nobunaga suggested that a new era should begin in 1573 The general meaning of Tensh was heavenly righteousness

In 1589 1590 a diplomatic mission led by Hwang Yun gil was sent to Japan The Joseon ambassador was received by Hideyoshi

The fictional plot of the classic Akira Kurosawa film The Seven Samurai takes place in the 15th year of Tensh

Tensho may mean

Fray Marcos de Niza was a Franciscan friar He was born in Nice which was at that time under the control of the Italian House of Savoy He went to America in 1531 and explored the area above Sonora

In written Latin the apex is a diacritic It is close to the shape of an acute accent The apex is used to show that a vowel is long and not short That means that the vowel is pronounced for longer

The shape and length of the apex can be different It can even sometimes be different within the same writing While pretty much all apices are made up of a of a line sloping up to the right the line can be more or less curved and is different in length from less than half the height of a letter to more than the height of a letter Sometimes it is put at the top with a hook pointing out to the left Rather than being centered over the vowel it changes the apex is often drawn to the right

Later it developed into the acute accent which is still used in some languages to mark vowel length In particular Czech and Slovak Hungarian Irish and Icelandic

Although not really known by some modern Latinists the sign was actually used a lot during classical and postclassical times The reason why it is not usually noticed is probably because of its smallish size and the fact that it is usually quite thin People who look carefully will soon start to notice apices in the exhibits of any museum not only in many of the more formal epigraphic writings but also in handwritten palaeographic things

Forgetting the apex modern Latin spelling has recently started marking long vowels by using the macron The macron is a sign that had always been used and still is to mark metrically long syllables This has caused confusion between syllable and vowel length in Latin and most western dictionaries still cannot describe the nature of Latin vowels properly because of this To make even more confusion the acute accent is sometimes used in Latin to mark stressed syllables just like in Spanish when the macron is not used

The apex is often thought to be the opposite of another ancient Latin diacritic the sicilicus which is said to have been used above consonants to show that they should be pronounced as doubles However in his article Apex and Sicilicus Revilo P Oliver says that they are the same sign a geminationis nota This was used over any letter to show that the letter should be read twice 

If Revilo P Oliver is right the apex as a sign showing vowel length would have been made in the time when long vowels were written double Then when long vowels were not regularly written twice

Differential geometry is a field of mathematics It uses differential and integral calculus as well as linear algebra to study problems of geomery The theory of the plane as well as curves and surfaces in Euclidean space are the basis of this study Big discoveries were made in the 18th and 19th century In geometry the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees Carl Friedrich Gau wondered whether triangle bearings of ships really has a sum of angles of exactly 180 degrees with this question he was among the pioneers of modern differential geometry

A long time ago differential geometry was used for map projections Today it is used for fields as diverse as general relativity theory or satellite naviagation Grigori Perelmans proof of the Poincar conjecture uses differential geometry

Hanok is a type of house It is built in a traditional Korean style of architecture

The main feature of Hanok is that it has combination of ondol the Korean under floor heating system and wooden floor for heating and cooling This style is mainly used in Korea because of problems caused by the area having both a continental climate and an oceanic climate

Hanoks have different shapes in different parts of Korea In the northern part of the Korean peninsula Hanok have the structure of a house with several wings The wings are often built in either a square or the letter L This helps keep the wind out of the house in the colder northern places and helps keep the house warm These kind of house also has low roofs In the warmer southern Korean peninsula Hanok have a single wing and a wooden floor This helps let the air in and out

The Hanok is also different based on the class of the people who live it Hanok of Upper class people usually have tiled roofs while lower class houses have roofs made of rice straw Hanok for the upper class people are built not only to be homes but also to be very ornamental

A cappella music is music where people sing without instruments

In a choir there are up to 5 parts soprano alto tenor baritone and bass A cappella can also have those 5 parts A difference is with percussion With musical instruments percussion is done with musical instruments that you hit such as drums In an a cappella performance a person makes the percussion sound For a beatbox performance performers make sounds like electric drums synthesizer and electric guitar Another part of percussion in a cappella performance is making classical drum sounds for tapping the beat

For the first scores needed Especially scores for a cappella are needed If someone has an musical knowledge and ability Finale and NWC are programs for arrangement Through those programs you can also listen and practice the songs with ease 

Normally there should be at least 4 participants soprano alto tenor or baritone someone who can do bass and percussion at once By arranging differently you can perform only with men or women

General form of the team would need 6 participants 1 soprano 1 alto 1 tenor 1 baritone 1 bass and 1 percussion To prepare the performance there should be two kinds of practice individual and team one which means each performer memorize their each part at home and modify the harmony at meeting In these days there are additional performances like dancing storytelling which is also important and can make a cappella performance fun and interesting

There are several kinds of music in a cappella these days such as barbershop classical contemporary gospel doo wop jazz and world

A barbershop group has 4 people They usually sing religious and dynamic musiccn The name of this genre originated from the tradition that when many men who gathered in barbershop meet someone who can sing well they made team and just sang a song with no musical instruments

In classical a cappella people perform classical music such as a Turkish march Overture William Tell madrigal etc

Contemporary is the most popular kind of a cappella these days For this kind the bass line should be stronger and the chorus should have variety The percussion should make their sound more like drums This genre is similar to doo wop but the chorus part is more complex and has a variety of sound effects

Doo wop is also getting more popular because of its simple style Even though it has simple moto it can be interesting with great vocal and chorus

Boxers briefs are mens underwear They are tight like briefs but still have long legs like boxer shorts They are becoming increasingly popular and are worn by lots of teenagers and young men

Boxer briefs are usually made of soft material and can be made in different colours Some boxer briefs have an opening with buttons on the front Others just have an elastic waistband and can be pulled on or off like briefs The waistband is often a separate piece of elastic and is sometimes in a color Some boxer briefs have elastic at the end of the legs and stitching across the bottom

Spanking is hitting the buttocks of another person to cause them pain but without injuring them Spanking normally involves one person hitting the buttocks of another person with an open hand

Spanking is used to punish children and teenagers for unacceptable behavior Historically boys have been more frequently spanked than girls

Usually in a spanking the child lies across the parents lap and the parent brings their open hand down upon the childs buttocks Alternatively the youngster might be told to bend over or lie face down across a bed Spankings may be delivered over the trousers over the underwear or on the bare bottom People who approve of spanking say that the bottom is the safest place to hit the child since there is little danger of injury to this part of the body

Green chemistry is a type of chemical research and engineering It supports the design of products and processes that use as little dangerous substances as they can Environmental chemistry is the chemistry of the natural environment and of pollutant chemicals in nature But green chemistry wants to reduce and prevent pollution at its source In 1990 the Pollution Prevention Act was passed in the United States This law sought original and new ways to handle pollution It aims to avoid problems before they happen

Green chemistry applies organic chemistry inorganic chemistry biochemistry analytical chemistry and even physical chemistry While green chemistry seems to focus on just industrial applications it does apply to any chemistry choice Click chemistry is often said to be a style of chemical synthesis that has the same aim as green chemistry Green chemists reduce the hazards and increase the efficiency of any chemical choice It is distinct from environmental chemistry which focuses on chemical phenomena in the environment

1 Prevent waste

Create products without or with minimal wastes so that the wastes do not need to be taken care of afterwards

2 Design safer chemicals and products

Design chemicals to have little or no toxicity without affecting effectiveness

3 Design less hazardous chemical syntheses

Design a way of synthesising products without it being toxic to humans or the environment

4 Use renewable raw materials

Use renewable raw materials like plant materials other than depleting ones such as Fossil fuels

5 Use catalysts not stiochiometric reagents

Use of catalysts because of their ability to be able to be reused and that they are less harmful than reagents

6 Avoid chemical derivatives

Chemical derivatives generate wastes that can be avoided

7 Maximize atom economy

Make sure that a greater percentage of the atoms present in the reactants of a chemical reaction are used in the products that are also usable

8 Use safer solvents and reaction conditions

Avoid using harsh solvents but if that cannot be avoided then use benign chemicals

9 Increase energy efficiency

Use the normal ambient temperature and pressure wherever possible

10 Design for degradation

Design materials to breakdown into benign substances by bacterial or other environmentally sound ways

11 Analyse in real time to prevent pollution

Monitor and control the formation of by products during a reaction

12 Minimize the potential for accidents

Design chemicals to minimize the potential for accidents

Toastmasters International is a global educational organization which helps to improve English speaking skills and communication In each club members are led by the Toastmasters Manual to speak in front of an audience fluently to think quickly and to react confidently

The first Toastmasters club opened on October 22 1924 at Santa Ana California United States by Ralph C Smedley It was called Smedley Club Number 1 Today there are over 13000 clubs in 116 countries

A typical Toastmasters club is made up of 20  30 people who gather weekly throughout the year The club meetings last for about two hours and there are many roles The meetings generally consist of the following

Anyone age 18 and above and who pays a fee can join the club and improve hisher speaking and communication skills

Roles

The Competent Communication Manual is a basic manual for Toastmasters Members follow it to present ten speeches Each of the ten topics is dedicated to improving one of the speakers basic skills The skills are

Memristor is a shortcut for English words memory resistor It is described as one of the basic elements of electronic circuit because it cant be replace by any combination of these elements This element can change its resistivity acording the voltage but even afrer disconnection it remembers resistivity for unlimited time It can work like analogi memory or a resistive switch which can has infinity number of states

Professor Leon Chua mathematically described this element in 1971 In 90s scientists from HP labs discovered several materials that appeared to be good candidates to construct a hypothetical memristor by Leon Chua

The four element can change its conductivity by the voltage and after power interruption the size of the resistivity stays the same No combination of the other three circuit elements can replace a memristor Only the memristor allows reconfiguring properties so it allows changing a whole electronic circuit Analogy behaviour is similar to synapses in the brain

Memristor has a great potential by using in computer science For example today computers have to boot from hard drives because data are erased from operation memory immediately after shutting down the computer The process of booting takes a lot of time and energy Memristor could be used for quicker data loading because it remembers data even after power interruption Memristors could be used to speed the booting process

The first products using memristor technology are expected to become available in 2013

A geostationary orbit is a geosynchronous orbit directly above the Earths equator with a period equal to the Earths rotational period and an orbital eccentricity of approximately zero A person watching from Earth sees a object in a geostationary orbit as motionless at a fixed position in the sky Communications satellites and weather satellites often have geostationary orbits so that the satellite antennas that communicate with them do not have to move to track them The ground atennas can be pointed permanently at a fixed position in the sky With fixed 0 latitude and circularity of geostationary orbits satellites in GEO differ in location by longitude only

The notion of a geosynchronous satellite for communication purposes was first published in 1928 by Herman Potonik The idea of a geostationary orbit was first disseminated on a wide scale in a 1945 paper entitled Extra Terrestrial Relays Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage by British science fiction writer Arthur C Clarke published in Wireless World magazine The orbit which Clarke first described as useful for broadcast and relay communications satellites is sometimes called the Clarke Orbit Similarly the Clarke Belt is the part of space about convert35786kmmi 3abbron above sea level in the plane of the equator where near geostationary orbits may be implemented The Clarke Orbit is about convert265000kmmi 3abbron long

Weevils are herbivorous beetles They have a long snout at the front of their head called a rostrum Weevils are a family the Curculionidae which may be the largest beetle family with about 45000 named living species That makes it the largest family in the animal kingdom In addition the superfamily Curculionoidea has ten more families of closely related weevil type beetles

The family has some pests which damage plants of interest to humans The most famous weevil is the boll weevil which ruins cotton crops

The Ips genus feeding on Ponderosa pine introduces a fungus to the tree The fungus blocks resin canals which leaves the weevil free to eat Resin would normally wash the insects out it is a defence mechanism The fungus often kills the tree and groups of dead trees are a focus for forest fires In this way the insect is indirectly responsible for serious fires

The maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais is a major pest It attacks both standing crops and stored cereal products including wheat rice sorghum oats barley rye buckwheat peas and cottonseed

4D is an important idea in geometry

Three dimension space has length depth and height The fourth dimension is in relation to that three dimensions like a vertical dimension

In physics the time is considered as a fourth dimension but in real time people are not allowed to perceive it and it is used for modeling physical and social causes

In mathematics four dimension space is an abstract concept which has been studied by mathematics and philosophers for almost three hundred years

The mathematicians who studied four dimension space were Mbius Schlfi Bernard Riemann Charles Howard Hinton etc

In twentieth century the concept of spacetime was developed That connects space and time The difference is that spacetime is not a Euclidean space but it is called Minkowski continuum The four dimension space was mostly studied in the nineteenth century

Profiling is collecting information about someone in order to describe them andor predict their behaviour and actions It is often used for criminals or people believed to behaving illegally More recently used on employees in the work place to improve success

A basic profile consists of an APB and is a visual description based on eyewitness information 

A psychological profile is created in the absence of eyewitness information or in addition to using evidence to create a picture of the suspect and help the police force to understand how the suspect is behaving

Predictive profiling attempts to predict which people might commit crimes in the future

Criminal profiling criminal profiling is a tool used by police forces to create a picture or idea of a suspect based on eyewitness information and any other evidence they have

Some people fear profiling is taken too far by police forces and can lead to harassment and arrest based on skin colour religious beliefs culture nation of origin or any social type or group that can be stereotyped by characteristic behaviour 

Behavioural profiling is used in business to help recruit the right person for a job to understand how to improve morale and to drive down staff turnover pinpoint who is ready for development and in precisely which areas and boost people management abilities

Kula is a traditional trade method that takes place in the Milne Bay Province of Papua New Guinea

The Kula Exchange takes place on eighteen islands including the Trobriand Islands and involves thousands of people The traders involved travel by canoe over hundreds of miles to exchange their Kula valuables These valuables can be in the form of red shells that are traded to the North of the Islands or in the form of white shell armbands which travel to the South of the Islands Therefore creating a ring of moving valuables throughout the islands The terms of trade change in different regions For example some traders have to exchange a white armband for a necklace or must trade a red shell for a white shell armband There are also differences on who can take part in the trading process such as in the Trobriand Islands their chiefs mainly take part in the exchange process whereas in Dobu anyone can take part 

The Kula valuables are mainly traded for social status and recognition in the Island region The people that an individual trades with become trusted trade partners creating a strong potentially life long relationship between the exchange parties These relationships need trust to be provided on both sides of the trade and also a mutual agreement of safety and support for each other 

Kula valuables are usually passed on to their trade partners after a certain amount of time therefore the valuables are always moving around the Kula Ring The person who originally owned the valuable has full ownership and rights over the item so he can keep it sell it or even break it Every person who therefore receives the item does not fully own it as there is always a true owner This creates a sense of responsibility over how the object is handled by other traders toward the original owner However the original owner is sometimes unknown lost in the Kula Ring

The ability to take part in the Kula Exchange is not immediately given to just anyone An individual must buy into the system by getting involved in lower trade circles than the Kula 

The Kula valuables are rated by value and age and so are the relationships created through their exchange Traders will often try to collect valuable and notorious Kula objects that will boost the status of the traders name in the Kula Ring Kula Exchange is based on trust strong social obligations and the cultural value system Those who hold on too long to their Kula valuables gain a bad reputation in the system

The Kula Exchange system determines many social hierarchies and authoritative positions among the trade islands For example the chiefs living on the Trobriand Islands in the 1970s owned the most shells and also the most valuable shells Therefore they were responsible for most of the organization and direction of the trade systems in their region Also the ten most influential men among all the islands control about 90 per cent of the Kula items With this amount of control and competition relationships between traders become fragile and ruined by manipulation and deceit

The Kutchi people traditionally reside in the Kutch region of the northwestern Indian state of Gujarat and in the Sindh province of Pakistan

A faafafine is a boy who is raised as a girl all the way through adulthood Historically this has been classified as a third gender in the tradition of Samoan society

This usually occurs when there are too many sons and not enough daughters in a family They identify themselves as females in a males body People from societies that do not recognize a third gender may mistake them for being either homosexual or transsexual

They take on the role of both male and female in the society eg teaching construction and also domestic work They tend to have sexual intercourse with both sexes however rarely with another faafafine

Maslenitsa is one of the most popular and cheerful religious holidays in Russia It originated from pagan times before Russia was converted to Christianity At first this holiday was a symbol of the spring solstice but nowadays it is considered a Christian holiday which goes right before the Great Lent During Maslenitsa people enjoy almost any food except meat Usually Maslenitsa lasts for seven days and on the last day of this holiday people burn a doll which is made of branches and straw and dressed in bright clothes This doll is called Maslenitsa and it symbolizes the cold and severe winter By burning Maslenitsa people say goodbye to winter and greet a warm spring

Every day of Maslenitsa plays a great role On Monday people greet the holiday with games such as sledding snowballs riding on swings and so on Russian people believe that happiness and joy which they feel during this day will accompany them throughout a year On Tuesday people play games and bake pancakes which are called blini Blini are the most popular food which is made during this holiday These pancakes have a round form and symbolize the Sun and warmth On Wednesday people usually visit their friends and relatives and treat each other with blini On Thursday by tradition people try to drive away winter by riding on horses around the village or around the places they live Friday is usually called Mothers in law evenings because sons in law come to visit their mothers in law On merry Saturday everyone goes to visit their relatives All people drink and eat as much as they want and play different games Sunday is the last day of the holiday It is also called the Sunday of forgiveness because on this day everyone asks forgiveness from relatives and friends for offences and mistakes committed against them The most appropriate answer is God will forgive After that people usually sing songs dance and at the end of the day they burn the doll

Maslenitsa is also considered as a family holiday because spring is a symbol of new life People who marry during this time are considered as very strong and happy couples who will give a birth to many children During Maslenitsa some people even punish those who did not marry yet by throwing them into snow

Consternation is the feeling of anxiety or fear

In medicine an acute disease is a disease that has either or both of

This is an adjective It is part of the definition of many diseases Because of this it is in their name for example severe acute respiratory syndrome acute leukemia

The word acute may often be confused by the general public to mean severe This is different and something can be acute but not severe

Acute hospitals are hospitals which are meant for short term medical andor surgical treatment and care The related medical speciality is called acute medicine 

Subacute is described as between acute and chronic An example is subacute fever symptoms or subacute endocarditis Another example is subacute sclerosing panencephalitis This is a rare brain disease One of the symptoms of this disease is less intellectual function which means someones brain does not work as it should

Chronic is the opposite of acute Chronic means a long term condition for example chronic bronchitis Chronic may also be confused by people who do not work in medicine to mean severe Again this is a different thing medically and something can be chronic but not severe

Acute toxicity describes the bad effects of a substance that come either from a single exposure or from many exposures in a short amount of time To be known as acute toxicity the bad effects should happen within 14 days of the substance thouching something

Acute toxicity is different from chronic toxicity Chronic toxicity talks about the bad health effects from many exposures often at lower levels to a substance over a longer amount of time

It is widely thought to be wrong to use humans as tests for acute toxicity research However some information can be picked up from investigating cases when humans accidentally make contact with the substance Otherwise most acute toxicity data comes from animal testing or more recently in vitro testing methods and inference from data on similar substances

Pygmalion is a play by George Bernard Shaw

A street girl selling flowers Eliza meets Professor Higgins Higgins was writing down her pronunciation for his study but Eliza misunderstood him as a policeman and caused trouble Higgins says he can make her a duchess It was changing her pronunciation Later she remembers what he said and goes to learn pronunciation with a desire to be an upper class woman 

Higgins decides to do an experiment with her He deceives all the people at a party It was making them believe that she is a duchess After this success Higgins suggests two options for Eliza One is marrying based on her beauty The other is running a flower shop with money from Colonel Pickering who is a rich man Eliza refuses to do both of them and she leaves his home Higgins and Colonel Pickering look for Eliza as soon as they know that she left They find her in Mrs Higgins house but Eliza refuses to go back She says she would marry Freddy

George Bernard Shaw is famous for giving audiences a twist by not doing what they expect In comedy people expect someone in a bad situation to be in a better one at the end They expect a poor person to marry a rich man They expect a villain to be punished In Pygmalion the flower girl in the bad situation gets better in the end This girl selling flowers on the street rises to the upper class It was through changing her language

However contrary to the audiences expectation romance between flower girl and Professor Higgins doesnt happen She doesnt marry a rich men Also George Bernard Shaw reflected his beliefs to reform the society in this play 

In the 20th century there were many poor people on the street Especially little girls worked all day for a tiny amount of money The author had much interest in poor people and womens freedom And he believed speech was one of the things that separated rich and poor people That is the starting point of Pygmalion He used the change of language as a means to rise to the upper class 

In mythology Pygmalion was a sculptor who did not like women He couldnt find a woman to love And he decided to make a statue Galatea In the play Pygmalion is compared to Professor Higgins And Galatea is compared to Eliza Pygmalion made Galatea to be his ideal woman And Professor Higgins changed Eliza into a perfect upper class woman He taught her everything from how to talk to how to behave in front of people This process of making Eliza an upper class woman is criticized as playing with a live doll as though she didnt have her own soul Higgins treats her as an object

Also the common expectation of audiences that womens fate is determined by men is criticized It is becuase of Elizas reaction after the success of pretending to be a duchess She thought the two options suggested by Higgins would be selling herself 

When she was selling flowers at least she didnt have to sell herself She doesnt want to rely on a rich man but decides to marry a poor man Freddy She says she can make something of him She values love more than anything else

In genetics a mosaic means the presence of two different genotypes in an individual which developed from a single fertilized egg As a result the individual has two or more genetically different cell lines derived from a single zygote 

Mosaicism may result from

The phenomenon was discovered by Curt Stern In 1936 he demonstrated that recombination normal in meiosis can also take place in mitosis When it does it results in somatic mosaics These are organisms which contain two or more genetically distinct types of tissue

People who have mosaicism are often called chimeras This is easiest to see when it affects eye colour A chimera can have two different coloured eyes if the DNA difference between cells happens to be in an eye colur gene

However there are other possible reasons for having two different coloured eyes For example David Bowie has the appearance of different eye colours due to an injury that caused one pupil to be permanently dilated 

Anti fans are the group of people who are opposed to particular person system or idea This word is from a prefix anti which means opposed Anti fans gather and criticize particular thing which they hate

Anti fans activities are very diverse Anti fans usually work and share their views in online website They make anti fan page Eg anti fan website anti fan blog anti fan internet cafe etc And they criticise their target spread a rumor about the target and post malicious comments to Internet articles Anti fans also work when they are offline They sometimes boo and jeer at their target and even start a movement against the target 

Early their activities used to be constructive criticism but nowadays the movement of anti fans is changing to severe insult to their target with no specific reason The ruthless attack causes a lot of social problems now A lot of celebrities who are the anti fans target are suffering from their behaviors In some case they may accuse anti fans of personal insults 

Anti fans targets are various The most usual target is entertainer There are a lot of anti fans website for the entertainer who they dislike Eg Some anti fans oppose a form of music movie athlete politician political party TV series idea etc Surprisingly the number of anti fans tends to be proportional to the targets popularity Thus the number sometimes becomes a yardstick of stars popularity

Intelligent anti fan is one type of anti fans Intelligent anti fans act as if they are the targets real fan and do wrong and bad behaviors as the fan They intelligently create the targets bad image and gather more anti fan 

The Mountain Pygmy Possum is a small mouse sized nocturnal marsupial of Australia It is found high up in rock screes and boulder fields of southern Victoria and in Kosciuszko National Park New South Wales

This possum is a Lazarus taxon and the only living species in the Burramys genus It is also the only Australian mammal restricted to an alpine habitat Its prehensile tail at 14 cm is longer than its 11 cm head and body length Its diet consists of insects fleshy fruits nuts nectar and seeds 

The Mountain Pygmy Possum was first described as a Pleistocene fossil by Robert Broom in 1896 It was thought to be extinct until 1966 when a living specimen was discovered in a ski hut on Mount Hotham

Three geographically isolated populations are known to exist These populations have been shown to be genetically distinct For most of the year males and females live apart from each other The females live on the better part of the rocky slopes while the males live on the margins usually lower on the mountain In order to breed the males migrate to the females habitat During the ski season on Mount Higginbotham the males had to cross a road which put their survival in jeopardy A Tunnel of Love was constructed under the road and a road sign was put in place to warn drivers

Censorship in movies is the act of giving a movie a very strong film rating or banning the movie altogether

The highest film rating label in UK would be 18 which means those under 18 cannot look at buy or rent any film under this rating Films with such a rating often have very strong language explicit sexual content or heavy violence If the content of the film is higher than the 18 rating the movie is then banned entirely

Refused Classification is the very strongest film rating in Australia This rating means a film has been banned from a particular part of Australia This rating is tagged onto films which the Australian Classification Board has declared too severe for viewing by general public

The highest film rating is NC 17 which means No Children 17 and Under Admitted Such movies contain strong sexual content very strong violence or extremely graphic language and are usually considered too intense for an R rating

The Monsanto process is a way of making acetic acid It uses a catalyst to add a carbonyl group to methanol This process operates at a pressure of 3060 atm and a temperature of 150200 C It gives a selectivity greater than 99 It was developed 1960 by German chemists working at BASF Chemists at Monsanto introduced a new catalyst system in 1966 Tody chemist make acetic acid by the Cativa process a similar iridium based process developed by BP Chemicals Ltd which is more economical and environmentally friendly So the Monsanto process is not used very much in industry

The process has several steps which repeat to remake the catalyst

The catalytically active species is the anion cis Rh2I2 The catalytic cycle has been shown to involve six steps two of which do not involve rhodium conversion of methanol to methyl iodide and the hydrolysis of the acetyl iodide to acetic acid The first organometallic step is the oxidative addition of methyl iodide to cis Rh2I2 to form the hexacoordinate species Rh2I3 This anion rapidly transforms by the migration of a methyl group to the carbonyl ligand affording the pentacoordinate acetyl complex RhI3 This five coordinate complex then reacts with carbon monoxide to form the six coordinate dicarbonyl complex This decomposes by reductive elimination to form acetyl iodide and regenerate the active form of the catalyst Acetyl iodide is then hydrolyzed to acetic acid

The reaction mechanism is first order with respect to methyl iodide and the catalyst Hence the rate determining step of the catalytic cycle has been proposed to be the oxidative addition of methyl iodide to the catalyst Chemist think that this occurs with the rhodium center making a nucleophilic attack on the carbon of methyl iodide

The Monsanto process for making acetic acid inspired chemists to invent a way to make Acetic anhydride It is produced by carbonylation of methyl acetate

In this process lithium iodide converts methyl acetate to lithium acetate and methyl iodide which in turn affords through carbonylation acetyl iodide Acetyl iodide reacts with acetate salts or acetic acid to give the product Rhodium iodides and lithium salts are employed as catalysts Because acetic anhydride is not stable in water the conversion is conducted under water free conditions in contrast to the Monsanto acetic acid synthesis

The Communist Party of Pakistan is a communist party in Pakistan

The CPP was founded in Calcutta Union of India on March 6 1948 A decision was taken at the Second All India Conference of the Communist Party of India which was held in Calcutta at that time that a separate communist party ought to be created in the new State of Pakistan It was thought that Pakistan being a relatively small country and suffering from instability was ripe for revolution The delegates from Pakistan separated themselves and held a separate session were they constituted the CPP

Osteopathy is a philosophy that refers to the ability of the human body to heal itself

Endogamy is the idea that a person ought to marry another person from the same group as them The type of group isnt always the same it could be based on a religion a class or a social group Often group endogamy is enforced by arranged marriages this is a system based on benefits for the group rather than marriage for love

By marrying a person with the same group characteristics it means that the partners will have similar views or beliefs about something Many people marry endogamously for reasons of compatibility which can be due to choice But there are also other reasons when there is less choice involved or there is disapproval if it is not followed

By doing this it keeps the numbers of a group to a minimum and thus creates stronger group bonds For example when moving to another country a Sikh family may actively look for other Sikh families to mix with in order to facilitate Sikh marriages By merging they create a stronger bond between their own communities and can be a way to deal with being a minority

If a group has been marrying endogamously for a long period of time the gene pool may be smaller and there is a greater chance of genetic disease For example within the Jewish community Tay Sachs disease is a common genetic disease

Exogamy is when a person ought to marry someone from outside a certain group

In most places exogamy is practiced in order to avoid incest which is taboo in many groups across the world This is to avoid some of the effects that endogamy creates such as genetic diseases If two parents have very different genes then there is a lesser chance of a child inheriting both copies of that gene

Exogamy is used to make a connection between two groups For example when a person marries another they become part of the family This connection may be for reasons of inter group cohesion In other words creating an alliance with another group

Claude Levi Strauss an anthropologist argued that when two families are connected by the marriage of two people it creates more relationships for trading other things such as food It also means that they have more people to rely on In order to keep this going groups with trade sistersdaughters for wives and trade back in return

Throw out the baby with the bath water is an idiom

The phrase describes a special kind of mistake which happens when something good is lost while trying to get rid of something bad 

The idiom summarizes what happens when something which is necessary is rejected along with what is not necessary

A slightly different explanation focuses on the loss of the essential while holding on to what is not essential In other words the idiom is applicable not only when its a matter of throwing out the baby with the bath water but also when someone might throw out the baby and keep the bath water

This idiom comes from a German proverb das Kind mit dem Bade ausschtten In 1512 Narrenbeschwrung by Thomas Murner includes a woodcut picture showing a woman tossing a baby out with waste water

Roderick MacKinnon is a professor of Molecular Neurobiology and Biophysics at Rockefeller University He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry together with Peter Agre in 2003 for his work on the structure and operation of ion channels

MacKinnon was born in Burlington Massachusetts and initially attended the University of Massachusetts Boston MacKinnon then transferred to Brandeis University after one year and there he received a bachelors degree in biochemistry in 1978 studying calcium transport through the cell membrane for his honors thesis in Christopher Millers laboratory It was also at Brandeis where MacKinnon met his future wife and working colleague Alice Lee

After receiving his degree from Brandeis MacKinnon entered medical school at Tufts University He got his MD in 1982 and received training in Internal Medicine at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston He did not feel satisfied enough with the medical profession so in 1986 he returned to Christopher Millers laboratory at Brandeis for postdoctoral studies

In 1989 he was appointed assistant professor at Harvard University where he studied the interaction of the potassium channel with a specific toxin taken from scorpion venom He learned how to purify proteins and to use X ray crystallography In 1996 he moved to Rockefeller University as a professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology and Biophysics There he started to work on the structure of the potassium channel These channels are of particular importance to the nervous system and the heart The channels enable potassium ions to cross the cell membrane

Potassium channels demonstrate a seemingly strange activity they permit the passage of potassium ions whereas they do not allow the passage of the much smaller sodium ions Before MacKinnons work the detailed molecular architecture of potassium channels and the exact means by which they conduct ions remained speculative In 1998 despite barriers to the structural study of integral membrane proteins that had stopped most attempts for decades MacKinnon and colleagues determined the three dimensional molecular structure of a potassium channel from bacteria utilizing X ray crystallography With this structure and other biochemical experiments MacKinnon and colleagues were able to explain the exact mechanism by which potassium channel selectivity occurs

His prize winning research was conducted primarily at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source of Cornell University and at the National Synchrotron Light Source of Brookhaven National Laboratory

The cosmic distance ladder is the way astronomers measure the distance of objects in space No one method works for all objects and distances so astronomers use a number of methods

A real direct distance measurement of an astronomical object is possible only for those objects that are close enough to Earth It is the larger distances which are the problem Several methods rely on a standard candle which is an astronomical object that has a known standard luminosity

The ladder analogy arises because no one technique can measure distances at all ranges encountered in astronomy Instead one method can be used to measure nearby distances a second can be used to measure nearby to intermediate distances and so on Each rung of the ladder provides information that can be used to determine the distances at the next higher rung

The astronomical unit is the mean distance of the Earth from the Sun This we know quite accurately Radar bounce off artificial satellites and inner planets provide the data then the result is worked out by computer 

Parallax is the use of trigonometry to discover the distances of objects near to the solar system

As the Earth orbits around the Sun the position of nearby stars will appear to shift slightly against the more distant background These shifts are angles in a right triangle with 2 AU making the short leg of the triangle and the distance to the star being the long leg The amount of shift is quite small measuring 1 arcsecond for an object at a distance of 1 parsec

This method works for distances up to a few hundred parsecs

Objects of known brightness are called standard candles Most physical distance indicators are standard candles These are objects which belong to a class that has a known brightness By comparing the known luminosity of the latter to its observed brightness the distance to the object can be computed using the inverse square law 

where m the apparent magnitude and M the absolute magnitude For this to be accurate both magnitudes must be in the same frequency band and there can be no relative motion in the radial direction

Some means of accounting for interstellar extinction which also makes objects appear fainter and more red is also needed The difference between absolute and apparent magnitudes is called the distance modulus and astronomical distances especially intergalactic ones are sometimes tabulated in this way

Two problems exist for any class of standard candle The principal one is calibration finding out exactly what the absolute magnitude of the candle is 

The second lies in recognizing members of the class The standard candle calibration does not work unless the object belongs to the class At extreme distances which is where one most wishes to use a distance indicator this recognition problem can be quite serious

A significant issue with standard candles is the question of how standard they are For example all observations seem to indicate that Type Ia supernovae that are of known distance have the same brightness The possibility that the distant Type Ia supernovae have different properties than nearby Type Ia supernovae exists

With few exceptions distances based on direct measurements are available only up to about a thousand parsecs which is a modest portion of our own Galaxy For distances beyond that measures depend upon physical assumptions that is the assertion that one recognizes the object in question and the class of objects is homogeneous enough that its members can be used for meaningful estimation of distance

Physical distance indicators used on progressively larger distance scales include

In a Hertzsprung Russell diagram the absolute magnitude for a group of stars is plotted against the spectral classification of the stars Evolutionary patterns are found that relate to the mass age and composition of the star In particular during their hydrogen burning period stars lie along a curve in the diagram called the main sequence 

By measuring the properties from a stars spectrum the position of a main sequence star on the H R diagram can be found From this the stars absolute magnitude is estimated A comparison of this value with the apparent magnitude allows the approximate distance to be determined after correcting for interstellar extinction of the luminosity because of gas and dust

In a gravitationally bound star cluster such as the Hyades the stars formed at approximately the same age and lie at the same distance This allows relatively accurate main sequence fitting providing both age and distance determination

This is not a complete list of methods but it does show the ways astronomers go about estimating the distance of astronomical objects

The Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search or SWEEPS was a 2006 astronomical survey project It used the Hubble Space Telescope to watch 180000 stars for seven days They did this to find extrasolar planets

The stars that were watched in this survey were all in the Sagittarius I Window

Sixteen planets were discovered They took from 06 to 42 days to orbit the sun Planets which took less 12 days to orbit the sun have not been detected before Because of this they were called ultra short period planets by the search team USPPs were discovered only around low mass stars This means that larger stars might have destroyed any planets orbiting so closely or that planets could not move as far inward around larger stars

The planets SWEEPS 4 and SWEEPS 11 orbited stars that looked so different from their neighbors that the SWEEPS scientists could watch the planets more This allowed them to find the mass of the planets

4 H in the United States is a youth organization administered by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture of the United States Department of Agriculture with the mission of engaging youth to reach their fullest potential while advancing the field of youth development The name represents four personal development areas for the organizations members head heart hands and health The organization has over 65 million members in the United States Members are five to 19 years old in approximately 90000 clubs

The goal of 4 H is to develop citizenship leadership responsibility and life skills of youth through experiential learning programs and a positive youth development approach Many people think of 4 H as an agriculturally focused organization as a result of its history But 4 H today focuses on citizenship healthy living science engineering and technology programs

Today 4 H and related programs exist in over eighty countries around the world The organization and administration varies from country to country Each of these programs operates independently They cooperate in international exchanges global education programs and communications

The 4 H motto is To make the best better while its slogan is Learn by doing

The start of 4 H began around 1900 with the work of several people in different parts of the United States The focal point of 4 H has been the idea of practical and hands on learning which came from the desire to make public school education more connected to rural life Early programs tied both public and private resources together to benefit rural youth

During this time researchers at agricultural experiment stations of the land grant universities and USDA saw that adult farmers did not readily accept new agricultural discoveries but educators found that youth would experiment with these new ideas and then share their experiences and successes with the adults So rural youth programs became a way to introduce new agriculture technology to the adults

A B Graham started one of the youth programs in Clark County Ohio in 1902 which is considered the birth of the 4 H program in the United States The first club was called The Tomato Club or the Corn Growing Club TA Dad Erickson of Douglas County Minnesota started local agricultural after school clubs and fairs also in 1902 Jessie Field Shambaugh developed the clover pin with an H on each leaf in 1910 and by 1912 they were called 4 H clubs The national 4 H organization was formed in 1914 When the United States Congress created the Cooperative Extension Service of the USDA by passage of the Smith Lever Act of 1914 it included within the CES charter the work of various boys and girls clubs involved with agriculture home economics and related subjects By 1924 these clubs became organized as 4 H clubs and the clover emblem was adopted

The first 4 H camp was held in Randolph County West Virginia Originally these camps were for what was referred to as Corn Clubs Campers slept in corn fields in tents only to wake up and work almost the entirety of each day Superintendent of schools G C Adams began a boys corn club in Newton County Georgia in 1904 However the city of Jacksboro Texas also stakes a claim to having the first forerunner to 4 H in 1910

4 H membership hit an all time high in 1974 as a result of its popular educational program about nutrition Mulligan Stew shown in schools and on television across the country

The Emeishan Traps is a flood basalt volcanic province in Southwestern China around Sichuan province Many igneous rock types can be found there This is known as large igneous province in geology Other names for the traps include Permian Emeishan Large Igneous Province and other variations The Traps are the step like rock made up of many layers of basalt which were laid down by successive eruptions of magma 

The eruptions that lead to the Emeshian traps began about 260 million years ago The traps are much smaller than the Siberian Traps which occurred not long afterwards about 251 million years ago Despite this the Emeshian traps were large enough to have an impact on the ecology of the time and on paleontology They can be associated with mass extinction events that occurred at the end of the Guadalupian epoch of the Permian period

As such the Emeishan Traps form one aspect of the larger scientific debate on the causes of mass extictions The end Guadalupian extinction occurred at almost the same time as the Emeshian Traps were formed This fact has been used to support the argument that volcanism is the main driving force behind mass extinctions Another theory that has been proposed to explain mass extinctions is that meteor or comet impact events caused them In this context the hypothesis is that impact events cause flood basalt eruptions such as those which generated the Emeshian Traps This hypothesis is controversial though

The mucous membranes are skin like linings of mostly endodermal origin They are covered in epithelium which are involved in absorption and secretion They line cavities that are exposed to the external environment and internal organs They are at several places contiguous with skin at the nostrils the mouth the lips the eyelids the ears the genital area and the anus Unlike skin which has hair growing out of it mucous membranes are hairless

The sticky thick fluid secreted by the mucous membranes and glands is called mucus The term mucous membrane refers to where they are found in the body and not every mucous membrane secretes mucus

Knob and tube wiring was an early type of electrical wiring In knob and tube wiring wires were held to the wooden structure by ceramic knobs and were protected by ceramic tubes when they went through a piece of wood Wires were held to the knobs by another piece of non conducting wire A material called loom protected the wire when it entered a junction box which usually contained an outlet switch or light fixture Splices were soldered together and wrapped in cloth electrical tape The insulation on knob and tube wiring was usually cotton cloth soaked in asphalt To prevent short circuits the hot and neutral wires were kept far apart This is not necessary on modern wiring because modern insulation alone is enough to prevent short circuits Knob and tube wiring did not have a ground wire and therefore did not have three prong outlets Most electrical codes allow the use of a GFCI to update knob and tube outlets to three prong without installing any new wire

Knob and tube wiring used cloth insulation Over time this insulation can wear out become brittle and fall off leaving bare wire The ceramic knobs and tubes provide some protection because even if the insulation does fall off the bare wire can not touch the wooden structure The insulation is also somewhat flammable Unlike modern wiring splices were not contained in a protective box If a splice failed it could make a spark and start a fire The fuse boxes usually had no protection from using an incorrect fuse An incorrect fuse could cause the wiring to overheat and become damaged or start a fire Another problem is that when a fuse blew people who didnt know or didnt care about the hazards would sometimes replace it with a coin or a ball of foil if a replacement fuse wasnt available leaving no overload protection at all These issues can be partially corrected by installing a modern circuit breaker panel with arc fault circuit interrupter breakers There was also no ground wire Knob and tube can be updated with a GFCI to add the equivalent of grounding

Unlike modern wiring knob and tube supply and return wires were not always alongside each other In the oldest installations several branch circuits could share the same neutral wire which can cause overloads To prevent overloads in this layout the neutral wires were protected with fuses If a neutral fuse blew or was removed it could create a dangerous condition where the power appeared to be off but was in fact still present Three way switches could also be wired in such a way that the outer ring of a lamp socket which is normally connected to neutral could be connected to hot which is an electric shock hazard

Post Postmodernism is a general term used to describe new developments emerging from Postmodernism It is a positive idea that faith sincerity and trust can be better for society Postmodern irony Postmodernism is a way of thinking about culture and thought It often challenges the certainty and authority of vital areas of our lives However as an almost sixty year old term many do not think it is relevant to how we live our lives now and suggest a positive earnest look at the world we live in

Modernism began in the late 19th Century as a rejection of tradition and an attempt to see the world differently It is associated with the Enlightenment Events such as World War 2 and the Great Depression made many feel Modernism had failed This led to Postmodernism which is cold and skeptical of the grand narrative of Western Society This grand narrative is explained by Jean Franois Lyotard as something Postmodernism is a very broad term that cannot be defined by specific themes It is an all encompassing way of thinking

Postmodernism is seen as a theory for explaining 20th Century culture With the 20th Century now behind us and a new century beginning many have suggested that Postmodernism is outdated in our current world Advances such as the Internet Mobile Phones and Television have changed the way we live making the world a smaller place but also making communication and interaction with things around us less intimate Post Postmodernism takes this as a key reason why a return to sincerity and authentic expression is the way forward for the 21st Century 

Post Postmodernism is a very new idea that is still forming There are many different ideas about how Post Postmodernism could evolve and shape culture

Zygmunt Bauman uses the term Liquid Modernity to refer to the freedom of ideas information and people It draws upon the global nature of society Distinct cultures ideas and categories are meeting and fusing in the 21st Century It has been called a world of fragmented and incommensurate identities and personae Liquid Modernity is a powerful reaction to Postmodernism as it states that through privitisation and the global economy we are now free to determine our own existence and path in the world

In 2010 Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin Van Den Akker wrote an article called Notes on Metamodernism that characterised life today as an oscillation between the realism of Postmodernism and the idealism of Modernism They believe the two can work together and that modern culture is based on navigating these oppositions They list as opposing forces that a big variety of artists theorists and creatives constantly alternate between

Jesse Thorns public radio show The Sound of Young America put forward the phrase New Sincerity Thorn says that some people and things in modern life are so entertaining and genuine that they can only be enjoyed sincerely without irony Using Evel Knievel as an example he says Here is a real man who feels at home as Spidey on the cover of a comic book Simply put Evel Knievel boggles the mind New Sincerity is a popular culture movement that shares many ideas with post postmodernism

German American Slavist Raoul Eshelman wrote in his book Performatism Or the End of Postmodernism that many new cultural documents present viewers with simple identifiable characteristics that are powerful By making us aware of the artificial and set conditions of a piece of work he believes we can have a genuine sincere experience His main example is the film American Beauty

As an art movement Altermodernism is a reaction to what Nicolas Bourriaud calls the standardisation of culture It was first discussed at the Altermodern Tate Triennial In his manifesto Bourriaud says that Increased communication travel and migration are affecting the way we live He calls contemporary existence a cultural landscape saturated with signs This means that we are overloaded with information and overlapping of cultures and ways of living Bourriaud believes art is a way to create new pathways and find meaning in modern society

Exercise physiology is the study of the acute responses and chronic adaptations to a wide range of physical exercise conditions In addition many exercise physiologists study the effect of exercise on pathology and the mechanisms by which exercise can reduce or reverse disease progression Professional bodies in most developed countries review and approve education programs to ensuring the quality and consistency of education

An exercise physiologists area of study may include but is not limited to biochemistry bioenergetics cardiopulmonary function hematology biomechanics skeletal muscle physiology neuroendocrine function and central and perpheral nervous system function Also exercise physiologists range from basic scientists to clinical researchers to clinicians to sports trainers

Otto Haberstroh was a German chemist and founder of the CDU local group in GlauchauSachsen

He was one of the founders of the CDU local group Glauchau very fond of working in the CDU and was therefore attacked by the SED in the press Because of the SED he was seized and brought to the NKWD on 19 November 1948 He was accused of having done propaganda for national socialism and spying the economy when he was working in Brazil Although he was able to prove he has done nothing wrong he was kept in prison until 10 May 1949 He was let out because of his bad health and fled to Western Germany So he was not judged in the Waldheimer Prozessen

Later he became work leader of Bayer Dormagen

A short circuit is a problem in an electrical circuit where two or more wires that are not supposed to come in contact with each other touch A short circuit can result in a very high current flowing through the circuit This high current can destroy components melt insulation and start a fire Circuit breakers and fuses are devices that detect short circuits and shut the power off before any damage can be done

A circuit breaker is a device designed to shut off an electrical circuit when too much current is flowing This usually occurs if too many devices are plugged in or if there is a short circuit Circuit breakers are usually installed in the electrical panel Some circuit breakers also have GFCI protection Inside the circuit breaker there is usually an electromagnetic coil When too much current flows through the coil it pulls on the switch shutting the power off The coil reacts to immediate short circuits There is also a metal strip that will bend and pull on the switch if it gets too hot This reacts to extended periods of too much current Some advanced circuit breakers monitor current electronically and shut the power off when an electronic sensor detects too much current A circuit breaker does the same job as a fuse but unlike a fuse a circuit breaker does not need to be replaced to be reset

The Merchant of Venice is a comedy written by William Shakespeare which is quite early work of his own This play is usually classified as comedy on the other hand it is controversial whether this is a comedy since Shylock the character who plays villain is questionable if he is a real villain The Merchant of Venice is mainly about courtship story between a young Venitian and a beautiful lady who is bound to choose her husband by following her dead fathers will His friend the merchant of Venice borrows money from a Jew because for the Venitian lover and this story brings the issue dealing justice

A Painful Case is a short story written by James Joyce an Irish author This short story is one of the series which was published in his 1914 series A Painful Case is a story which shows loneliness and isolation of the two characters named Mr James Duffy referred as Mr Duffy and Mrs Emily Sinico referred as Mrs Sinico The overall plot describes the life of Mr Duffy and his character as a lonely person who encountered with one woman by accident In the story Mr Duffy is portrayed as a person who is solitude To describe his daily routine every morning he sets out for work from Chapelizold by tram On afternoon he goes to Dan Burks and eats his lunch there a bottle of larger beer and small trayful of arrowroot biscuits On four o clock hes free He dined in an eating house in Georges street where he felt himself safe from the society o Dublins gilded youth and where there was a certain plain honesty in the bill of fare Him having a same occupation after four years his daily routine does not change as well His evenings were spent either before his landladys piano or roaming about the outskirts of the city This was what he does everyday evening He does nothing special this just continues throughout his whole life Moreover he doesnt have any friends or companions he enjoys his own spiritual life without interaction with other people He visits his family and relatives only in Christmas or and funeral only when someone in his family passes away His only hobby is to attend opera or concerts since he is a fan of Mozarts music 

One evening Mr Duffy attends a concert in the Rotunda and there he notices one lady who is sitting next to him When Mrs Sinico makes a comment about the unluckily small audience he takes this as an invitation to talk to her and they do talk Mrs Sinico has an attractive face looking intelligent After few weeks pass Mr Duffy meets Mrs Sinico again at a concert in Earlsfort Terrace This time he has an opportunity to be close to her while Mrs Sinicos daughters attention diverts to become intimate While having a conversation with Mrs Sinico Mr Duffy figures out that she has a husband but he doesnt feel cautious of her Mr Duffy and Mrs Sinico meet a third time by accident and Mr Duffy asks her to meet him again sometime After that they become to see each other often in Mrs Sinicos house Mr Duffy lends his books and music to Mrs Sinico and shares his intellectual life with her By this time they become very close to each other Mr Duffy and Mrs Sinico spends more and more time together in Mrs Sinicos house sometimes in Mrs Sinicos college Together they speak some personal matters Mrs Sinico stays with Mr Duffy until the dark came The two are alike having many things in common One night when they talk about their undefeatable loneliness and Mrs Sinico had shown every sign of unusual excitement caught up his hand passionately and pressed it to her cheek Mr Duffy is astonished by her action and she had misunderstood him that she thought hes feeling what she feels Mr Duffy became disillusioned by how Mrs Sinico interpretes his words After this incident Mr Duffy doesnt visit her for a week and finally sends a mail to meet her In the end they agree they cannot meet again and they eventually end the intercourse Four year passes and Mr Duffy returns to his normal life He avoids concerts because he is afraid for chances of seeing her One night he reads a newspaper while he is eating and as soon as he sees something he stops eating He reads the same words again and again and is unable to finish his meal When he goes back to his house he reads it again and it is about the death of Mrs Sinico Mrs Emily Sinico aged forty three years was killed at Sydney Parade Station yesterday evening After reading the most painful case as said in the article he is disgusted by it To him she seems crude and degraded for having drunk and died in such a shameful manner Mr Duffy goes out to the pub because of the memory of her hand touching him While he is drinking he struggles with the two images he has of her as of right now the lonely drunkard and the intelligent woman he was close to He realizes that she has died and has become a memory He wonders if he could have done something for her The previous sentence indicates that Mr Duffy realizes that their relationship was love But he never realizes it until it was too late Now he thinks of her lonely life and his at the same time He knows that his lonely life will continue in the same pattern until he dies As he walks even though it is extremely cold he feels that Mrs Sinico is almost there with him it seems that he could even hear her voice since his memory of her is so strong He looks down at the wall of the park and he sees lovers lying He felt that he had been outcast from lifes feast This means that he is an outcast from human life The lovers are aware that he is there and it seems like they want him to leave 

One human being had seemed to love him and he had denied her life and happiness he had sentenced her to the death of shame This statement is totally true that when Mrs Sinico shows interest by showing unusual excitement Mr Duffy ignores her emotions Perhaps Mr Duffys cold headedness leads her to be heart broken and the reason why they end their intercourse Mrs Sinico thought she was very close to him that she opened up to him while Mr Duffy only thought her as a friend Mrs Sinico desired for love and caring because she is a lonely person She is married and had a child but still they didnt spend time with her as a family Mr Duffy didnt realize at that time but once her presence leaves him he realizes he is alone that he has been alone for his entire life and he will always be alone until the day he dies This story is A Painful Case written by James Joyce which shows isolation and loneliness of the two characters Mr Duffy and Mrs Sinico

A gentlemens agreement is an agreement made between two or more people It can be written down spoken or just understood A gentlemens agreement needs people to be honourable and stick to the agreement instead of enforcing the agreement Because of this it is different from a legal agreement or contract because a legal agreement or contract can be enforced if needed

Its height is about 10m The bark of the tree is dark gray The flowers are white and they grow between June and July The tree grows fruits between September and October The fruits are brown and their shape is similar to chickens claw

The plant grows well in both shade and light This plant is resistant to cold but not the dry This plant is salt tolerant so it thrives near the sea This plant is also resistant to pollution so it thrives in cities and other industrial areas The seeds are sown from February to March The germination rate is about 2 15 Most trees begin to bud two years after they are planted

The woods are used for many purposes like building instruments ships and furniture Because the stem tastes sweet it can also be eaten and can be used to make drinks This stem is also used for medicine The stem also neutralises alcoholic poisoning

Dalit is the name given to a group of people who have been historically considered outcasts in societies from South Asia and Eastern Africa Today the Dalits former known as Untouchables have increasingly adopted the term Dalit as their way out of the social segregation imposed by the caste system

Untouchability is an ancient form of discrimination based upon caste It is not merely the inability to touch a human being but also an attitude towards a minority group translated into various physical acts norms and practices

The Dalit status carries with it the stigma of untouchability because it is associated with menial degrading tasks immediately connected with their traditional occupations which include unclogging sewers disposing of dead bodies and cleaning latrines

The discrimination against the Dalits takes various forms such as

The rate of literacy among the Dalits as per 1991 census was 3741 as compared to 5769 for non Dalits Untouchability in schools has contributed to drop out and illiteracy levels for Dalit children The 1991 census of India reported that Dalit communities were one of the least literate social groups in the country with only 30 of Dalit children recognized to have basic reading and writing skills

Half of Indias Dalit children are undernourished 21 are severely underweight and 12 die before their 5th birthday Between 1998 1999 at least 50 of Dalit women suffered from anemia High morbidity and child mortality are firmly linked to their low quality of life imposed by poverty educational status and discrimination

There have been many attempts to neutralize the caste based discrimination In the 1930s the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi began to change attitudes towards the Dalit minority In 1949 Untouchability was outlawed by the Indian constitution and Indian law does not permit the practice of a caste system Discrimination against the Dalit minority has become an important human rights and politicalissue Even so in rural areas the Dalits are still facing the consequences of the slow and steady decline of discrimination 

Today the Dalit movements which have emerged during the 20th century continue to struggle for equality The progress of the past few decades shows hope for an improved level of equality within Indian society In 1997 Kocheril Raman Narayanan became the first Dalit to have been elected President on India Another important political figure was Mayawati Kumari the leader of the Bahujan Samaj Party which represents the Dalits She has been elected four times as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Indias most populous state

The National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights established in 1998 by Dalit human rights activists is one of many organisations committed to the elimination of caste discrimination Its main objectives are to hold the State accountable for all Human Rights violations committed against Dalits to sensitize civil society by raising visibility of the Dalit problem and to render justice to Dalit victims of discrimination and violence The International Dalit Solidarity Network which was established in 2000 is another organisation concerned about caste discrimination and similar forms of discrimination based on work and descent It has emerged as a network of national solidarity groups from affected countries such as those in South Asia and even West Africa  

Mesosaurus is an extinct marine reptile from the early Permian of southern Africa and South America It was one of the first known marine reptiles and had many adaptations to a fully aquatic lifestyle It is usually considered to have been anapsid although Friedrich von Huene considered that it was synapsid and this hypothesis has been revived recently

Mesosaurus was one of the first reptiles to return to the water after early tetrapods came to land in the later Devonian It was around convert1mft in length with webbed feet a streamlined body and a long tail that may have supported a fin It probably propelled itself through the water with its long hind legs and flexible tail Its body was also flexible and could easily move sideways but it had heavily thickened ribs which would have prevented it from twisting its body

Mesosaurus had a small skull with long jaws The nostrils were located at the top allowing the creature to breathe with only the upper side of its head breaking the surface Its teeth were suitable for catching small nektonic prey such as crustaceans

Mesosaurus was significant in providing evidence for the theory of continental drift because its remains were found in southern Africa and eastern South America two far away places As Mesosaurus was a coastal animal and therefore could not have crossed the Atlantic Ocean this distribution indicated that the two continents used to be joined together

Bokbunja ju is a Korean traditional wine made from fermented Korean black raspberries called bokbunja The main ingredient bokbunja is harvested at the early June After getting rid of impurities brewers of Bokbunja ju have the harvested bokbunja ferment with some sugar for a week Adding alcohol to the fermented bokbunja they have it ripen and it becomes bokbunja ju Bokbunja ju is crimson in color and sweet It has between 14 and 16 alcohol Especially Korean men enjoy drinking it in a sense that it is believed to be very good for male sexual stamina In that sense there has been a saying that after drinking bokbunja ju men can throw a chamber pot with their urine

A hangwa is a Korean traditional cookie Hangwa includes Yumilgwa Yugwa Dasik Dasik and Yeot Gangjeong Hangwa is also called Jogwa since it is made of diverse grains and looks like fruits 

Hangwa was very popular among people over the Shilla and Goryeo because the yield of grains had went up a lot and people tried not to eat meat for religious reasons The religion at that time was Buddhism Since then Hangwa has become necessary in wedding ceremonies memorial sacrifice days and social dinners

The basic materials of Hangwa are mostly natural and based on the materials Hangwa is primarily divided into seven kinds and the recipes are slightly different

Hangwa does not go bad easily because it is very good at preservation This comes from the fermentation of grains and use of honey Also Hangwa is very nutritious Ancestors thought that food was natural medicine and the idea was reflected on the nutrition of Hangwa too Also Hangwa shows Korean traditional virtue and emotions It represents the warmth of neighbors In ancient times when people had ceremonies or social meetings they made their guest go back with some food which was mostly Tteok and Hangwa In other words Hangwa talks about the kindness and the affection between people in Korea

The Verdin is a small bird It is the only species in the genus Auriparus and the only species in the family found in the New World

The Verdin is a very small bird At 45 inches in length it rivals the Bushtit as one of the smallest passerines in North America It is gray overall and adults have a bright yellow head and rusty shoulder patch Unlike the tits it has a sharply pointed bill

Verdins are insectivores They keep looking among the desert trees and scrubs They usually live alone except when they pair up to make their nests They are very friendly birds Verdins occasionally try to get tidbits of dried sugar water from hummingbird feeders

Verdins always have and will live in southwestern United States and northern Mexico ranging from southeastern California to Texas throughout Baja California and into central Mexico north of the Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt

The Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt also known as the Transvolcanic Belt and locally as the Sierra Nevada is a volcanic belt that extends 900 km from west to east across central southern Mexico Several of its highest peaks have snow all year long and during clear weather they can be seen bythose who live in Mexico on the many high plateaus from which these volcanoes rise

A volcanic belt is a large volcanically active place Volcanic belts are found above zones of very high temperature where magma is made by melting of rock in the Earths crust and upper mantle These areas usually appear along tectonic plate boundaries at depths of 10 50 km

The types of sikhae can be different depending on the main ingredients regions what the family and the person like In past times because of the limited transportation regions near the sea had more types of sikhae compared to the inland areas Koreans usually eat this food as a banchan

Sikhae was not included in any literature before the early part of the Korean Joseon Dynasty However that doesnt mean there was not sikhae and rather it guesses that sikhae was not written down After the middle of Joseon Dynasty sikhae have been mentioned in literature

Sikhae is made with fish salt cooked rice Korean traditional spices etc First wash fishes and put drained fishes with salt in a pot After about 10 days take the salted fishes out of the pot cut them into bite size pieces and then put them with cooked rice and chili powder in the pot again Lastly put shredded radish into the pot after another four days and finally eat sikhae as 10 more days are passing

 Gajamisikhae is the typical and popular Korean sikhae It is made mostly in the region of North Korea 

Sikhae has a lot of effects First sikhae as one of fermented food is easily digested by creating peptone peptide and free amino acid through the process of decomposition of protein and so good nourishing food for patients the old and the infirm and children Also millet one of ingredients of Sikhae helps people warm body in the winter when people have cold hands or feet due to the very cold weather 

It has the same units as entropy It is named after the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann

The Bushtit is a long tailed tit found in North America It is the only species in the family found in the New World and the only member of the genus Psaltriparus

The Bushtit lives in mixed open woodlands It also lives in parks and gardens It lives in the western United States and highland parts of Mexico all year ranging from Vancouver through the Great Basin and the lowlands and foothills of California to southern Mexico and Guatemala

The Bushtit is one of the smallest passerines in North America at 11 cm in length and 53 g in weight It is gray brown overall with a large head a short neck a long tail and a short stubby bill The male has dark eyes and the adult female yellow

The Bushtit is active and gregarious searching for small insects and spiders in mixed species feeding flocks with species such as chickadees and warblers of 10 to over 40 birds Members of the group keep making calls to each other that can be described as a short tsit

A duck pond is a pond for ducks and other water fowl Duck ponds give habitats for water fowl and other birds who use the water to bathe in and drink Duck ponds usually attract people who come to feed the ducks

A diapsid is a reptile with two fenestrae behind the eye on each side of its skull Most reptiles are diapsids and the condition does not occur in mammals The function of the holes is to improve jaw movements and to reduce the weight of the skull The holes give places for muscle attachment also as jaw muscles contract the holes allow space for the muscles to bulge

The Allosaurus skull shows the way the skull became lighter in dinosaurs especially the large theropods It is here not much more than a series of struts yet provides massive bite power

Some aquatic reptile groups lost the lower of the two openings leaving just one behind the eye This is called the euryapsid condition It is fairly certain that this is secondary and that the groups were originally diapsids The groups include

World War One guns were very new and powerful The machine gun was new and killed many people It took four to six people to work one They fired 400 to 600 bullets per minute The machine guns got too hot and needed water on them The first machine gun was made in 1884 by Hiram Maxim It was not used in battle until 1914

The German machine gun was the MG08 and the British used the Vickers Machine Gun The Vickers Machine Gun was very safe and easy to use The normal British army gun was the Lee Enfield 0303 rifle This was made in 1907 by James Lee The Lee Enfield could fire twelve bullets per minute The Germans used the Mauser rifle made in 1898 by Paul Mauser This was an excellent rifle but only held five bullets

The machine guns changed how war went and killed many soldiers Because they sometimes got too hot they could be slow The normal army guns shot straight and were very safe

The game is known for its strange and sometimes scary content

Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory just outside Batavia Illinois near Chicago is a US Department of Energy national laboratory specializing in high energy particle physics As of January 1 2007 Fermilab is operated by the Fermi Research Alliance a joint venture of the University of Chicago Illinois Institute of Technology and the Universities Research Association Fermilab is a part of the Illinois Technology and Research Corridor  

Fermilabs Tevatron was a landmark particle accelerator at convert39mikm in circumference it was the worlds second largest energy particle accelerator until being shut down on September 30 2011 In 1995 two teams at Fermilab announced the discovery of the top quark

In addition to high energy collider physics Fermilab is also host to a number of smaller fixed target and neutrino experiments such as MiniBooNE SciBooNE and MINOS The MiniBooNE detector is a convert40ftmadjon diameter sphere which contains 800 tons of mineral oil lined with 1520 individual phototube detectors An estimated 1 million neutrino events are recorded each year SciBooNE is the newest neutrino experiment at Fermilab it sits in the same neutrino beam as MiniBooNE but has fine grained tracking capabilities The MINOS experiment uses Fermilabs NuMI beam which is an intense beam of neutrinos that travels convert455mikm through the Earth to the Soudan Mine in Minnesota

A large piece of land was reserved for Fermilab but much of the equipment is underground The Fermilab scientists decided to use the land surface as an experiment in restoring Illinois original prairie They also started a farm to raise al herd of American bison The Fermilab Nature Areas is a separate non profit group that administers these programs

Asteroid 11998 Fermilab is named in honor of the laboratory

Between World War II and the 1960s the federal government funded different particle accelerators at competing universities to build high energy physics experiments Most notable were the Stanford Linear Accelerator which sent particles in a straight line the Brookhaven National Laboratory at SUNY Stoney Brook and the Cornell University synchrotron which sent particles around in a circle to have the same magnets work on the particles many times By the 1960s the cost of building bigger atom smashers were too high to fund each individual campus and the size of ring for the next circular accelerator would be too large to fit on an existing college campus So the federal government decided to start a new location to be run by physicists from several universities They held a competition to pick a site but politicians fought for it to be in Illinois

Weston Illinois was a community next to Batavia It was a subdivision of pre fabricated homes started in the early 1960s Sales were very slow so the land developers tried to attract Fermilab to be a new employer on the edge of the new town However it turned out that the amount of land needed would swallow up the entire town So the town voted to sell all of the land including the houses that had been built to Fermilab The town then dissolved

The laboratory was founded in 1967 as the National Accelerator Laboratory it was renamed in honor of Enrico Fermi in 1974 The labs first director was Robert Rathbun Wilson Wilson made many of the sculptures on the campus He is attributed as being responsible for it being finished ahead of time and under budget The high rise laboratory building on the site the unique shape of which has become the symbol for Fermilab is named in his honor and is the center of activity on the campus

Before the new buildings could be finished the scientists moved into the Weston houses and also moved all of the farm houses on Fermilab to that location for use as office space They renamed Weston Fermilab Village It still houses visiting scientists

Wilson brought in the team that had built the Cornell synchrotron to help build the original 200 GeV accelerator Two important inventions made this accelerator obsolete superconducting magnets and using the same acclerator ring to send two groups of particles around in opposite directions so that when the collide they would have twice the energy

After Wilson stepped down in 1978 to protest the lack of funding for the lab Leon M Lederman took on the job It was under his guidance that the original accelerator was replaced with the Tevatron accelerator The new accelerator was capable of colliding proton and an antiproton at a combined energy of 196 TeV Lederman stepped down in 1988 and remains Director Emeritus The on site science education center was named in his honor

From 1988 to 1998 the lab was run by John Peoples From that time until June 30 2005 the lab was run by Michael S Witherell On November 19 2004 Piermaria Oddone formerly of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California was announced as Fermilabs newest director Oddone began his term as director July 1 2005

Fermilab continues to participate in the work in the LHC including serving as a Tier 1 site in the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid The State of Illinois is funding a new Illinois Accelerator Research Center building at Fermilab for scientists and industrial partners

The first stage in the acceleration process takes place in the CockcroftWalton generator It involves taking hydrogen gas and turning it into H ions by introducing it into a container lined with molybdenum electrodes a matchbox sized oval shaped cathode and a surrounding anode separated by 1 mm and held in place by glass ceramic insulators A magnetron is used to generate a plasma to form H near the metal surface A 750 keV electrostatic field is applied by the CockcroftWalton generator and the ions are accelerated out of the container The next step is the linear accelerator which accelerates the particles to 400 MeV or about 70 of the speed of light Right before entering the next accelerator the H ions pass through a carbon foil becoming H ions

The next step is the booster ring The booster ring is a 468 m circumference circular accelerator that uses magnets to bend beams of protons in a circular path The protons coming from the Linac travel around the Booster about 20000 times in 33 milliseconds so that they repeatedly experience electric fields With each revolution the protons pick up more energy leaving the Booster with 8 GeV The Main Injector is the next link in the accelerator chain Completed in 1999 it has become Fermilabs particle switchyard with three functions it accelerates protons it delivers protons for antiproton production and it accelerates antiprotons coming from the antiproton source The final accelerator was the Tevatron It was the second most powerful particle accelerator in the world Traveling at almost the speed of light protons and antiprotons circle the Tevatron in opposite directions Physicists coordinate the beams so that they collide at the centers of two 5000 ton detectors D and CDF inside the Tevatron tunnel at energies of 196 TeV revealing the conditions of matter in the early universe and its structure at the smallest scale The Tevatron is being converted into a museum

The linear accelerator also has a medical treatment facility Doctors treat people with cancer by shooting protons or neutrons from the accelerator into their tumors

The heterojunction bipolar transistor is a type of bipolar junction transistor which uses different semiconductor materials for the emitter and base regions making a heterojunction The HBT is better than the BJT because HBT can handle signals of very high frequencies up to several hundred GHz HBT is commonly used in modern ultrafast circuits mostly radio frequency systems and in applications requiring a high power efficiency such as RF power amplifiers in cellular phones The idea of using a heterojunction is as old as the conventional BJT dating back to a patent from 1951

The principal difference between the BJT and HBT is in the use of different semiconductor materials for the emitter and base regions making a heterojunction This limits the injection of holes from the base into the emitter region since the potential barrier in the valence band is higher than in the conduction band Unlike BJT technology this allows a high doping density to be used in the base The high doping density reduces the base resistance while maintaining gain The efficiency of the heterojunction is measured by the Kroemer factor

Wet chemistry studies chemical reactions that occur in the liquid phase It is also called bench chemistry because many of the tests performed are done at a lab bench

Wet chemistry uses laboratory glassware such as beakers and flasks without quantitative chemical analysis using instrumentation Many high school and college laboratories teach students basic wet chemistry methods

Before the age of theoretical and computational chemistry it was the main form of scientific discovery in the chemical field So some people call wet chemistry classic chemistry or classical chemistry Todays society and quality control requirements need a high volume of wet chemistry So many wet chemistry methods have been automated and computerized for faster analysis

Wet chemistry techniques can be used for qualitative chemical measurements such as changes in color but often involves more quantitative chemical measurements using methods such as gravimetry and titrimetry Some uses for wet chemistry include tests for

Wet chemistry is also used in environmental chemistry settings and is used for to test

It can also involve the elemental analysis of samples eg water sources for items like

Korean Canadians are Canadians of Korean descent According to South Koreas Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade there are 223322 Koreans or people of Korean ancestry in Canada This is the fourth largest population of Koreans outside of Korea Also the government of South Korean guessed that there are more than 100000 Koreans living in Canada illegally

History  The first Koreans who came to Canada were Christians They were sent by Canadian missionaries to study Christianity in Canada Not many stayed in Canada though and in 1965 the total Korean population of Canada was only about 70 people However after 1966s change of Canadian immigration laws South Korean immigration to Canada grew Between 1970 and 1980 18148 Koreans immigrated to Canada and another 17583 came in the 1990s In the late 1990s South Korea became the fifth largest source of immigrants to Canada Toronto has the most Koreans in Canada but Vancouver has the highest growth rate of Koreans They have increased 69 since 1996 Montreal has the third most Korean immigrants at this time In 2001 More Koreans went to Canada than to the United States The number of temporary residents also grew after the Canadian government made visas not necessary South Korea sent the most international students to Canada in the late 1990s Many of the Koreans who came to Canada came from the Korean population in China

In the 1990s many Koreans came to Canada because unemployment was high and income growth was low It was the opposite in the United States at this time They also came because the Canadian dollar was very weak so they could get a lot of Canadian money from their Korean money In the USA they could get less American dollars So they had more money if they came to Canada Lastly in Korea at the time there was lots of anti American feelings and also many local native teachers came from Canada so Koreans knew Canadians very well 

Many Koreans in Canada are well educated and many new immigrants and their children are skilled workers such asdoctors professors engineers computer techniciansor businessmen

Korean Canadians are usually one of three types first generation immigrants the 15 generation who began their schooling in Korea but moved to Canada in their childhood or teen years and the second generation born in Canada Each group is very unique but Korean Canadians are very loyal to their Korean culture They do this by local culture activities university and alumni groups seniors groups language schools and business contacts Vancouver and Toronto have Korean language newspapers and Korean television and radio programs Korean dance music art as well as martial arts and Korean cuisine are very popular in Canada

Today many Korean Canadians are Christians and often attend Korean churches A small number are Buddhist or are not religious 

Statistics were researched in 2007 by the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade The statistics showed that among Koreans living in Canada 86084 are Canadian citizens 72077 are permanent residents 20738 people have student visas and 19271 other people are temporary residents The Canada 2001 Census said that there are 101715 Canadians of Korean descent but Korean community leaders and the media think that there are more than this A big group could be temporary students studying English According to the Canada 1996 Census 536 of Korean immigrants to Canada graduated from University compared to 23 of other Canadians However because Canadian employers prefer degrees from Canada Korean immigrants often do jobs that are not what they studied in Korea 40 worked in family owned businesses and their average income is only 67 of other Canadians income

Placodonts were a group of Triassic marine reptiles which had heavy flat teeth These teeth were used for crushing shellfish Placodonts are in the Order Sauropterygia the group that includes Plesiosaurs Placodonts were mostly between convert1to2mft0 in length up to a maximum convert3mft0 long They are found in marine sediments of the Middle and Upper Triassic 235250 million years ago

The first specimen was discovered in 1830 and they have since been discovered throughout central Europe North Africa the Middle East and China

The earliest forms like Placodus which lived in the early to middle Triassic looked rather barrel shaped Later placodonts had bony plates on their backs which protected their bodies while feeding

By the Upper Triassic these plates had grown so much that placodonts of the time such as Henodus and Placochelys looked like the sea turtles of modern day more than their ancestors Other placodonts like Psephoderma developed plates as well but in a different articulated manner that resembled the shells of horseshoe crabs and trilobites more than those of sea turtles All these adaptations are examples of convergent evolution as placodonts were not related to any of these animals 

Because of their dense bone and heavy armour plating these creatures would have been too heavy to float in the ocean and would have used a lot of energy to reach the water surface For this reason and because of the type of sediment found with the fossils it is suggested placodonts lived in shallow waters and not in deep oceans

The placodonts ate shellfish Their front teeth stuck out they would be used to dig up the shellfish and pull them from any attachment to the substrate Inside their mouth the teeth were large and flat they were used to crush the shells

Their diet consisted of marine bivalves brachiopods and other invertebrates 

Becoming Jane is a movie directed by Julian Jarrold in 2007 The setting of this movie is Hampshire England in the 1700s The movies story was based on a fictional biography written by Jon Spence Anne Hathaway played as Jane Austen and James McAvoy starred her opposite Thomas Lefroy This film won the 2007 Peoples Choice Award for Favorite Independent Movie and nominated for 2008 Ivor Novello Award for Best Original Film Score

Steven Chu is an American physicist and the 12th United States Secretary of Energy Chu is known for his research at Bell Labs in cooling and trapping of atoms with laser light which won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997 along with his scientific colleagues Claude Cohen Tannoudji and William Daniel Phillips He became Energy Secretary in 2009 Before that he was a professor of physics and molecular and cellular biology at the University of California Berkeley He was also the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory where his research was concerned primarily with the study of biological systems at the single molecule level Before teaching at Berkeley he was a professor of physics at Stanford University

He argues for more research into alternative energy and nuclear power He argued that the world should shift away from fossil fuels to help with climate change For example he discusses a global glucose economy This is a form of a low carbon economy in which glucose from tropical plants is shipped around like oil is today

His nomination to be Secretary of Energy was unanimously confirmed by the US Senate on January 20 2009 On January 21 2009 Chu was sworn in as Secretary of Energy in the Barack Obama administration Chu is the first person appointed to the US Cabinet after having won a Nobel Prize He is also the second Chinese American to be a member of the US Cabinet after Elaine Chao

He continues to work on science while working in the Energy Department He wrote a paper on gravitational redshift published in Nature in Feb 2010 and a second one co authored in July 2010

Under his leadership in 2010 the Department of Energy updated the water usage regulations on toilets and showers

In March 2011 Chu said that federal regulators should not delay approving construction licenses for planned US nuclear power plants because of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster I think those things can proceed Chu told reporters on Capitol Hill referring to construction license applications pending at the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission

In August 2011 Chu praised an advisory panels report on curbing the environmental risks of natural gas development Chu responded to the panels report on hydraulic fracturing Hydraulic fracturing breaks up rock to get more oil and gas out of the ground The report recommendations include greater data collection of air and water data rigorous air pollution standards and mandatory disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process The report recommends a range of tools for implementing these measures including regulation continuous improvement in best practices by industry and ongoing research and development Chu said in a statement I will be working closely with my colleagues in the Administration to review the recommendations and to chart a path for continued development of this vital energy resource in a safe manner he added

Republicans in Congress have attacked Chu for changing a 535 million federal loan to Solyndra a solar energy company When the company went bankrupt in 2011 the government lost the money A House Energy and Commerce subcommittee questioned Chu in 2011 about the loan

Pachypleurosaurs were primitive sauropterygian reptiles that vaguely resembled aquatic lizards and were limited to the Triassic period They were long animals ranging in size from 20 cm to about four metres in length with small heads long necks paddle like limbs and long deep tails The limb girdles are greatly reduced so it is unlikely these animals could move about on land The widely spaced peg like teeth project at the front of the jaws indicate that these animals fed on fish

Pachypleurosaurs are usually included among the Nothosaurs

The Northern Shoveler is a common and widespread duck It breeds in northern areas of Europe and Asia and across most of North America and is a rare vagrant to Australia In North America it breeds along the southern edge of Hudson Bay and west of this body of water and as far south as the Great Lakes west to Colorado Nevada and Oregon

The Northern Shoveler is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds applies The conservation status is Least Concern

The stiff tailed ducks are part of the Oxyurinae subfamily of ducks All have as their name implies long stiff tail feathers which are erect when the bird is at rest All have relatively large swollen bills

These are freshwater diving ducks Their legs are set far back making them awkward on land so they rarely leave the water

Their unusual displays involve drumming noises from inflatable throat sacs head throwing and erecting short crests

Feather sequences are complicated and it is hard to tell how old one of these ducks is Feathers are vital for survival because of this animals tendency to spend time in the water Without feathers this duck would die of hypothermia because it couldnt regulate its body temperature

Noteworty coins were minted during this era including the gold ban and koban

Tteokbokki is a Korean traditional food which has sticks of rounded rice cake as the main ingredient tteok is the Korean word for rice cake and bokki is the Korean word for something fried

Tteokbokki is divided into gungjung tteokbokki and general tteokbokki as one of Korean street foods

Gungjung tteokbokki is made by frying beef and rice cake with soy sauce It was developed in gungjung which means a Korean court

General tteokbokki is cooked with seasoning using gochujang with starch syrup or sugar for the sweet taste Generally gungjung tteokbokki has beef and vegetable because it was cooked at court but general tteokbokki has fish cake green onions and boiled egg

On a cooking book named Siuijeonseo which was written in late 1800s there is a record of tteokbokki However there is a guess that tteokbokki might have existed before late 1800s because of the fact that main ingredient of tteokbokki is a rice cake and there was a rice cake on the Three Kingdoms Period of Korea Gungjung tteokbokki is different from tteokbokki because there were no red peppers in Joseon Dynasty so they made gungjung tteokbokki with vegetables and meatsTteokbokki of today was first made by Mabokrim who has sold tteokbokki with gochujang since 1953

Inland seas also called epeiric or epicontinental seas are shallow seas over part of a continent

They usually happen with marine transgressions when the sea overtops the land They are caused by either global high sea level or the formation of large geologic basins which eventually connect to the ocean

There have been at some periods shallow seas inside continents Much of present day North America was covered by an epicontinental sea called the Sundance Sea during the Jurassic period In the Cretaceous an even larger area was covered by the Western Interior Seaway A modern example is the Baltic Sea The North Sea is not an inland sea but it does sit on continental shelf and so is epeiric The Hudson Bay is often considered an epeiric sea because its depth averages 100ft whereas for example the Bay of Bengal is 2600 metres deep So the epeiric seas are on the continental plate as are the inland seas The inland seas however are much more enclosed

The Amazon basin originally emptied into the Pacific Ocean when South America and Africa were part of Gondwana

After the brakeup of Gondwana the Amazon found its exit blocked by the rise of the Andes about 15 million years ago A great inland sea developed at times draining north through what is now Venezuela before finding its present eastward outlet into the South Atlantic Gradually this inland sea became a vast freshwater lake and wetlands where sediment flattened its profiles and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater Over 20 species of stingray most closely related to those found in the Pacific Ocean live today in the freshwaters of the Amazon which is also home to a freshwater dolphin In 2005 fossilized remains of a giant crocodile estimated to have been 46 ft in length were discovered in the northern rainforest of Amazonian Peru

The Mediterranean Sea looks like a clear cut example of an inland sea but its deepest point is 5267 m in the Calypso Deep of the Ionian Sea The Mediterranean is a genuine sea which has been squashed almost out of existence by the movement of Africa against the European tectonic plate It was formerly part of the ancient Tethys Ocean which surrounded the old global supercontinent of Pangaea So the Mediterranean is different from those inland seas which sit on top of continental plates

The Black Sea on the other hand is a genuine inland sea because it sits on continental plates which have subsided

A vast inland sea extended from the Gulf of Mexico deep into present day Canada during the Cretaceous It split the continent of North America into two halves Laramidia and Appalachia for most of the mid and late Cretaceous period It was 2500 feet deep 600 miles wide and over 2000 miles long

The Sundance Sea existed in North America during the mid to late Jurassic period of the Mesozoic Era It was an arm of what is now the Arctic Ocean and extended through what is now western Canada into the central western United States The sea receded when highlands to the west began to rise The sedimentary rocks which formed in and around the Sundance Sea are often rich in fossils

The Tyrrell Racing Organisation was an auto racing team and Formula One constructor It was created by Ken Tyrrell The team started racing in 1958 and started building its own cars in 1970 The team had its best success in the early 1970s During that time it won three drivers championships and one constructors championship with Jackie Stewart The team never did as well again but it kept winning races through the 1970s and into the early 1980s It won its final win at Detroit in 1983 The team was bought by British American Tobacco in 1997 It finished its last season as Tyrrell in 1998

Tyrrell Racing was created in 1958 It used Formula Three cars for Ken Tyrrell and local stars Tyrrell stopped being a driver in 1959 He did not think that he was good enough as a driver He began to run a Formula Junior operation He used the woodshed owned by his family business Tyrrell Brothers to do the work on the cars During the 1960s Tyrrell moved through the lower levels of formula racing John Surtees and Jacky Ickx raced for their first times with his team The teams most famous partnership was with Jackie Stewart Stewart first signed up in 1963 

Tyrrell ran the BRM Formula 2 operation during 1965 1966 and 1967 During this time Stewart was signed to the Formula One team Tyrrell then signed a deal to run Formula 2 cars made by French company Matra

With the help of Elf and Ford Tyrrell moved to Formula One in 1968 He started as a part of Matra International It was made up of Tyrrells own team and the French auto maker Matra Stewart was expected to race very well He won several Grands Prix in the teams Matra MS10 The cars most unusual feature was the use of aviation styled structural fuel tanks These let the car to be around 15 kg lighter Although it was lighter it was still stronger than the cars it was racing against The FIA thought that the technology was not safe They chose to not let it be used in 1970 They said that rubber bag tanks had to be used instead

For the 1969 championship the Matra team chose to not compete in Formula One Instead of competing Matra worked with Ken Tyrrells Matra International team They built a new DFV powered car with structural fuel tanks even though it would only be able to be used for a single season Stewart won the 1969 title easily driving the new Cosworth powered Matra MS80 Stewarts title was the first won by a French chassis It was the only one won by a chassis built in France It was a very special event for a team and a constructor that had only entered Formula One the year before

IN 1970 Matra merged with Simca For the 1970 season Tyrrell was asked by Matra to use Simcas V12 in place of the Cosworth Simca was a subsidiary of the American company Chrysler which was competition for Ford Stewart tested the Matra V12 He did not think it was as good as the DFV Ford gave Tyrrell a large part of the money they needed to race The team also got money for the French petroleum company Elf Elf had an agreement with Renault that did not allow them to provide money to anyone who was partnered with Simca Because of this Ken Tyrrell had to buy a March 701 chassis as temporary solution while making his own car in secret

Tyrrell was still sponsored by French fuel company Elf and Tyrrell would keep the traditional French blue racing colours for most of the rest of the time the company existed Tyrrell and Stewart ran the March Fords throughout 1970 with mixed success During this time Derek Gardner worked on the first Tyrrell built Grand Prix car at the woodshed in Ockham Surrey

The Tyrrell 001 which looked like the MS80 was first seen in F11970 It earned Stewart a pole position in the Canadian GP The car had problems in all of its 3 race starts The nearly identical Tyrrell 003 won both Drivers and Constructors Championships in F11971 Stewarts had health problems dealing with a stomach ulcer in 1972 and did not race He was well in 1973 and raced again He finishing 1st in the Championship On October 6 1973 Tyrrells other driver was killed in practice for the US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen Stewart who was to stop racing at the end of the season and Tyrrell decided they did not want to keep racing Without their best driver Tyrrell were never serious World Championship contenders again

The team did still win some races during the 1970s with Jody Scheckter and Patrick Depailler Most notable of these was Scheckters win at the 1976 Swedish Grand Prix They finished first and second in that race using an unusual Derek Gardner designed Tyrrell P34 car The P34 was the first successful six wheeled F1 car They replaced front wheels with smaller wheels mounted in banks of two on either side of the car The design was no longer used after Goodyear refused to make the small tires needed for the car

In 1977 the Turbo era started in Grand Prix racing By the mid 1980s normal cars could not race as well Without the enough money Tyrrell was the last team with the Cosworth DFV All other teams had changed to turbocharged engines It was the start of two decades of bad times for Tyrrell The last win for the classic Cosworth Ford DFV engine was by a Tyrrell car Michele Alboreto at the 1983 Detroit Grand Prix It was also Tyrrells last Grand Prix win

Tyrrell had money problems in the 1980s and 1990s In the late 1990s Tyrrell had problems with his health as well In 1998 and in the face of dwindling form and ill health he sold his team to British American Tobacco The team beccame British American Racing The last race for Tyrrell was the 1998 Japanese Grand Prix where Ricardo Rosset failed to qualify and team mate Toranosuke Takagi ended the race on lap 28 after a collision with Esteban Tueros Minardi

Weston Illinois was a community next to Batavia It was a subdivision of pre fabricated homes started in the early 1960s Sales were very slow so the land developers tried to attract Fermilab to be a new employer on the edge of the new town However it turned out that the amount of land needed would swallow up the entire town So the town voted to sell all of the land including the houses that had been built to Fermilab The people wanted to move the town to the east beyond the edge of Fermilab but county officials prohibited the move The town then dissolved

Before new Fermilab buildings could be finished the scientists moved into the Weston houses and also moved all of the farm houses on Fermilab to that location for use as office space They renamed Weston Fermilab Village It still houses visiting scientists

The Sundance Sea was an inland or epeiric sea covering much of western North America in the Jurassic period It was an arm of what is now the Arctic Ocean and extended through what is now western Canada into the central western United States The sea receded when highlands to the west began to rise

The Sundance Sea did not occur at a single time evidence suggests that it was a series of five successive marine transgressions Each was separated by a period of erosionThe sea advanced and receded from the Middle Jurassic onwards The terrestrial sediments of the Morrison Formation eroded from rising highlands to the west were deposited on top of the calcareous Sundance Formation as the sea retreated for the last time late in the Jurassic

The sedimentary rocks which formed in and around the Sundance Sea are often rich in fossils

The Sundance Sea was rich in many types of animals The oyster Gryphaea was very common and shark teeth have been found Fish belemnites and to an extent ammonites swarmed in shoals Crinoids and bivalvia dotted the seafloor Ophthalmosaurus a large ichthyosaur swam in the seas using its large long jaws to catch belemnite squid Pantosaurus a plesiosaur the size of a seal went after the easier to catch fish The largest marine reptile in the Sundance Sea was Megalneusaurus a large pliosaur similar to Liopleurodon Its fossils have been found in Alaska and Wyoming which were both covered by the Sundance Sea when it was alive

During the periods of recession dinosaurs and other Jurassic animals walked on the shores leaving fossil footprints

The Western Interior Seaway was a huge inland sea It split North America into two halves for most of the mid and late Cretaceous Period It was convert2500ftm deep convert600mikm wide and over convert2000mikm long

Sea level was high in the Cretaceous and the middle part of North America sank because a subducted plate pulled it down The sea entered both north and south and came and went during the course of the Cretaceous Widespread carbonate deposition suggests that the Seaway was warm and tropical with abundant calcareous algae The shrunken regressive phase of the Western Interior Seaway is sometimes called the Pierre Seaway

The Western Interior Seaway was a shallow sea filled with abundant marine life This included predatory marine reptiles such as plesiosaurs and mosasaurs that grew up to 18 meters long Other marine life included sharks such as Squalicorax and the giant shellfish eating Ptychodus mortoni There were advanced bony fish such as the massive 5 meter long Xiphactinus a fish larger than any modern bony fish Other sea life included invertebrates such as molluscs ammonites squid like belemnites and plankton including coccolithophores that secreted the chalky platelets that give the Cretaceous its name foraminiferans and radiolarians

The Western Interior Seaway was home to early birds also including the flightless Hesperornis which had stout legs for swimming through water and small wing like appendages used for marine steering rather than flight and the tern like Ichthyornis an early avian with a toothy beak Icthyornis shared the sky with large pterosaurs such as Nyctosaurus and Pteranodon Pteranodon fossils are very common and it was likely a major component of the surface ecosystem though it was only found in the southern reaches of the Seaway

On the bottom the giant clam Inoceramus left common fossilized shells in the Pierre Shale This clam had a thick shell paved with prisms of calcite deposited at right angles to the surface giving a pearly luster in life Paleontologists suggest that its giant size was an adaptation for life in the murky bottom waters where a correspondingly large gill area would have allowed the animal to cope with oxygen depleted waters

The Hooded Pitohui is a songbird of New Guinea with black and orange plumage

This species and its two close relatives the Variable Pitohui and the Brown Pitohui were the first known poisonous birds A neurotoxin called homobatrachotoxin found in the birds skin and feathers causes numbness and tingling in those touching the bird

The Hooded Pitohui gets its poison from part of its diet the Choresine beetles of the Melyridae family These beetles are also a likely source of the lethal batrachotoxins found in Colombias poison dart frogs

Common and widespread throughout New Guinea the Hooded Pitohui is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species

A direct proof is a way of showing that something is true or false by using logic This is done by combining known facts No assumptions are made when doing a direct proof Lemmas and theorems are used to prove direct proofs

A statement that can be proved with a direct proof is usually in the form if p then q Here p and q are facts To solve a statement like this every case where p is true must be considered

For example this statement can be solved with a direct proof if x and y are even integers then xy is an even integer Since x and y are even then we can say that x2m and y2n where m and n are integers We can also say that mn is an integer because adding two integers gives an integer Then we can say that xy2m2n2 Since mn is an integer we can say 22k where kmn We know that any integer times 2 is an even integer We can then say that any two even integers added together give an even integer

Direct proofs are used in mathematics logic and computer science The opposite of a direct proof is an indirect proof

The Hoxne treasure is the largest find of late Roman silver and gold in Britain 

The objects are now in the British Museum in London where the most important pieces and a selection of the rest are on permanent display In 1993 the Treasure Valuation Committee valued the hoard at 175 million

The hoard was buried as an oak box or small chest filled with items in precious metal with some in smaller wooden boxes and others in bags or wrapped in fabric Remnants of the chest and of fittings such as hinges and locks were recovered in the excavation The coins date the hoard to after AD 407 about the end of Britain as a Roman province 

The owners and reasons for burial of the hoard are unknown but it was carefully packed and the contents seem what a very wealthy family might have owned The lack of large silver serving vessels and of some of the most common types of jewellery suggest that the hoard is only part of the wealth of its owner

The Hoxne treasure contains several rare and important objects including a gold body chain and silver gilt pepper pots The hoard was excavated by archaeologists with the items largely undisturbed and intact The find has helped to improve the relationship between people using metal detectors and archaeologists It has influenced a change in English law on finds of treasurep173

Weston Illinois is an unincorporated community located in McLean County Illinois People still live there It is on US Route 24 The other town in Illinois named Weston was in DuPage County That town now houses only visiting scientists at Fermilab and has been renamed Fermilab Village

On 26 August 1867 W F Bryan laid out Weston The Original Town included 288 small lots five blocks that were not subdivided and a Public Park The depot and town hall were on the south side of the tracks The station was for the Toledo Peoria and Western Railroad In 1895 there were four churches Just east of town Western Cemetery has an area of natural tall grass prairie

In Illinois the same name cannot be used by more than one city or town However because both Weston locations started out without incorporating the problem was not discovered until after the names stuck

The neng Kaei means tranquil government

Euro disco is a form of disco based dance music which originated in the late 1970s in Europe as a more European variant of disco music Euro disco was based on disco music yet it was a more encompassing genre which borrowed influences from pop rock and New Wave music In such a way it was more pop friendly and less gritty than regular disco music It often included synthesizers within its composition

Euro disco as the term suggests was popular in Europe Nevertheless it also achieved popularity in the United States through artists such as Donna Summer Some regard Kraftwerk as the first Euro disco group Furthermore Giorgio Moroder was also a major force within the Euro disco scene

The Wilsons Bird of Paradise is a small bird of the Paradisaeidae family

The male is a red and black bird of paradise with a yellow mantle on its neck a light green mouth blue feet and two curved violet tail feathers The head is naked blue with a black double cross pattern on it The female is a brownish bird with a bare blue crown

Standing up the Secretary Bird is nearly 45 feet tall

A nucleophile is a species that donates an electron pair to an electrophile to form a chemical bond in a reaction All molecules or ions with a free pair of electrons can be nucleophiles Because nucleophiles donate electrons they fit the definition of Lewis bases 

Nucleophilic describes the attraction of a nucleophile to the nuclei Nucleophilicity sometimes referred to as nucleophile strength refers to a substances nucleophilic character and is often used to compare the attraction of atoms

Neutral nucleophilic reactions with solvents such as alcohols and water are called solvolysis Nucleophiles may take part in nucleophilic substitution reactions In those reactions a nucleophile becomes attracted to a full or partial positive charge

The terms nucleophile and electrophile were introduced by Christopher Kelk Ingold in 1929 replacing the terms cationoid and anionoid proposed earlier by A J Lapworth in 1925

The word nucleophile is derived from nucleus and the Greek word philos for love

In general within a row across the periodic table the more basic the ion the more reactive it is as a nucleophile In a given group polarizability is more important in the determination of the nucleophilicity In other words the easier it is to distort the electron cloud around an atom or molecule the more readily it will react For example the iodide ion is more nucleophilic than the fluoride ion

Examples of nucleophiles are anions such as Cl or a compound with a lone pair of electrons such as NH3

In the example below the oxygen of the hydroxide ion donates an electron pair to bond with the carbon at the end of the bromopropane molecule The bond between the carbon and the bromine then undergoes heterolytic fission with the bromine atom taking the donated electron and becoming the bromide ion This is a SN2 reaction occurs by backside attack This means that the hydroxide ion attacks the carbon atom from the other side exactly opposite the bromine ion Because of this backside attack SN2 reactions result in a reversal of the configuration of the electrophile If the electrophile is chiral it typically keeps its chirality though the SN2 products configuration is flipped as compared to that of the original electrophile 

An ambident nucleophile is one that can attack from two or more places resulting in two or more products For example the thiocyanate ion may attack from either the S or the N For this reason the SN2 reaction of an alkyl halide with SCN often leads to a mixture of RSCN and RNCS Similar mixtures will happen in the Kolbe nitrile synthesis

Alkyl metal halides are carbon nucleophiles found in the Grignard reaction Blaise reaction Reformatsky reaction and Barbier reaction organolithium reagents and anions of a terminal alkyne

Enols are also carbon nucleophiles The formation of an enol is catalyzed by acid or base Enols are ambident nucleophiles but in general nucleophilic at the carbon atom next to the carbons with double bond Enols are commonly used in condensation reactions including the Claisen condensation and the aldol condensation reactions

Examples of oxygen nucleophiles are water hydroxide anion alcohols alkoxide anions hydrogen peroxide and carboxylate anions

Of sulfur nucleophiles hydrogen sulfide and its salts thiols thiolate anions anions of thiolcarboxylic acids and anions of dithiocarbonates and dithiocarbamates are used most often

In general sulfur is very nucleophilic because of its large size which makes it readily polarizable and its lone pairs of electrons are readily accessible

Nitrogen nucleophiles include ammonia azide amines and nitrites

The Lanarkshire Derby is a football rivalry in Lanarkshire Scotland and matches are played between two of Motherwell Hamilton Academical Airdrie United and Albion Rovers

Motherwell vs Airdrie This game is the biggest Lanarkshire derby and big crowds usually come to watch this match at either Fir Park or Excelsior Stadium For a very long time Motherwell and Airdrieonians were the two biggest teams in Lanarkshire up until Airdrie went out of business in 2002 There has only been one game between these two teams since Airdrie re formed as Airdrie United in the 2007 Scottish Cup A Richie Foran goal won it for Motherwell that day in front of a crowd of 5924 the highest ever for an Airdrie United match Also this match had often been the final of the Lanarkshire Cup a competition where teams from all over Lanarkshire played in This competition stopped in 1996

This game is the second biggest Lanarkshire derby and the most Southern of all the derbies Up until 2008 both teams were mostly in different divisions Then Hamilton got promoted to the SPL and both teams were to play each other a lot This ended when Hamilton got relegated in 2011 meaning that Motherwell are now the only SPL team in Lanarkshire

This game is between the two middle rated teams in Lanarkshire and is not as big as when one of the teams play Motherwell Both teams have usually been in a league lower than the SPL so this is not thought to be a big derby

This game is big for both teams as they were both in the Monklands area until Airdrie moved to a new stadium in the Petersburn area in 1998 The first match between Albion and Airdrie was in 2010 when Airdrie beat Albion Rovers 1 0 at Cliftonhill Since that game both teams are in the same division in the 2011 12 season

This is not a big derby match as both teams have been in different divisions for most of their existence They were in the same league in 2001 but have not met each other since making this derby the smallest Both Coatbridge and Hamilton are 6 miles apart

This is the least remembered of the derbies as Albion have been in the lower divisions for most of their existence whilst Motherwell have been in the top division There is also no bad feeling between the two as a few young Motherwell players have gone out on loan to Albion Rovers over the years

Camposaurus is a dinosaur from the Late Triassic of North America It is a relative of Coelophysis This relationship was upheld by a recent phylogenetic anlysis

With fossils dating back to 205210 million years ago it is the oldest known neotheropod It is known from partial lower leg bones and other fragmentary material 

Staurikosaurus is a genus of Upper Triassic theropod dinosaurs It was a small lightly built carnivore from Brazil 

The rarity of Staurikosaurus remains may be a result of it being uncommon while alive or because it lived in an environment like a forest where fossils rarely form

At just convert225mft 80 centimetres tall and weighing just 30 kilograms Staurikosaurus was tiny in comparison to later theropods like Megalosaurus Staurikosaurus and the related Herrerasaurus are definite theropods and evolved after the sauropod line had split from the Theropoda

There exists very incomplete fossil record of Staurikosaurus but since the skeletal structure of the legs is known it can be seen that Staurikosaurus was a quick runner for its size It also had just two vertebrae joining the pelvis to the spine a distinctly primitive arrangement

Christian symbolism gives objects or actions a meaning that shows Christian ideas Religious symbolism has an effect when it affects both the intellect and the emotions The choice of actions and objects for symbolism is very small This makes it hard to chose a symbol that other religions and traditions do not use

Elemental symbols were often used by the early Church Water is an important symbol to Christians Water is symbolic in baptism It may also mean cleansing or purity Fire symbolizes both the Holy Spirit and light It is often used in the form of a candle flame The sources of these symbols comes from the Bible Examples include the tongues of fire that symbolized the Holy Spirit at Pentecost Jesus description of his followers as the light of the world and God is a consuming fire found in bibleverseHebrews12

The fish was the most important symbol to early Christians The symbolic fish was familiar to Christians from the earliest times It can be seen in Roman monuments such as the Capella Greca and the Sacrament Chapels of the catacomb of St Callistus The fish was used as a Christian symbol in the first decades of the 2nd century The symbol may come from the miracle Jesus is said to have performed by multiplying loaves of bread and fishes on the shore of the Sea of Galilee Its popularity is thought to mainly come from an acrostic made of the first letters of five Greek words Iesous CHristos THeou Yios Soter These form the Greek word Ichthys which means fish Iesous Christos Theou Yios Soter translates as Jesus Christ Son of God Saviour

The cross is one of the most well known symbols in the world It was used as a symbol from the earliest times This is shown in arguments against Christianity shown in the Octavius of Minucius Felix

In the early 3rd century Clement of Alexandria used the phrase  to mean the cross He used the phrase when discussing that the number 318 in bibleverseGenesis1414 was a foreshadowing of the cross and Jesus T is the Greek number fore 300 the first two letters of Jesuss name means 18 Tertullian called the Christian believers crucis religiosi ie devotees of the Cross In his book De Corona Tertullian tells how it was a tradition for Christians to trace the sign of the cross on their foreheads

The crucifix was not used until the 5th century French Medievalist historian M M Davy has described in great details Romanesque Symbolism as it developed in the Middle Ages in Western Europe

Ancient people believed that the flesh of a peafowl did not decay after death It became a symbol of immortality This symbolism was used by early Christianity Many early Christian paintings and mosaics show the peacock The peacock is still used in the Easter season in the east

Some of the oldest symbols in the Christian church are the sacraments The number of sacraments is different in each denominations All denominations have Eucharist and baptism Others which may or may not be used are ordination unction confirmation penance and marriage The rites are seen as a symbol of the spiritual change or event that takes place In the Eucharist the bread and wine are symbolic of the body and blood of Jesus In Roman Catholicism they become the actual Body of Christ and Blood of Christ through Transubstantiation This represent salvation brought by the death of Jesus The rite of baptism is symbolic of the cleansing of the sinner by God Where baptism is by immersion it symbolizes spiritual death and resurrection Different groups believe the sacraments mean different things Some Protestant denominations think they are only symbolic Roman Catholics Orthodox some Anglicans and some Lutherans feel that by the power of God the sacraments have an actual effect

Bohemia took part in some of the early modern Olympic Games It was an autonomous part of Austria Hungary until 1918 The team began taking part in the Olympics at the 1900 Summer Olympics After World War I Bohemia became part of Czechoslovakia Bohemian athletes competed for Czechoslovakia at the Olympics After Czechoslovakia was split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993 Bohemian athletes competed for the Czech Republic at the Olympics Bohemian athletes have missed only three Olympics the first in 1896 the 1904 Summer Olympics and the boycotted 1984 Summer Olympics

Basal is a term in biology for primitive or ancestral Basal is preferred because it is neutral and non judgmental This terminology came into use with cladistics The term is used in evolution and classification to mean the group which gave rise to later forms It is a term which works at any level a basal species gives rise to derived species and a basal group gives rise to derived groups 

Derived is the correct term in biology for specialised or advanced It is used for groups which have evolved from a more basal group A derived trait is a trait that is present in an organism but was absent in the last common ancestor of the group being considered Simplicity is often secondarily derived For example the absence of mitochondria in the anaerobic protist Entamoeba histolytica is a result of their secondary loss

In the last example note that apes are derived from monkeys but basal with respect to our own genus The status of being basal or derived is relative though living species can only be derived In any basal derived pair the basal member must have evolved before the derived member with evidence that some of its species gave rise to the derived member

Electronic dance music often simplified as EDM is a form of electronic music which is meant to be danced to often in the setting of a nightclub discothque or party Generally electronic dance music is created by producers and composers and is then used by DJs or disc jockeys in the above settings Electronic dance music takes many forms and styles As a genre it is united under the description that it is generally up tempo music created by electronic software and machines such as synthesizers drum machines keyboards samplers sequencers and computers Occasionally the term techno is used to describe electronic dance music in general despite being a generalisation as techno is a distinguishable subgenre of EDM

Being quite a generic term EDM has a variety of origins and derivations EDM can be said to stem from a fusion between regular dance music and electronic music One notable example can be Donna Summers 1977 single I Feel Love which combined elements of disco with electronic music The innovative blend helped trigger several major EDM genres such as Hi NRG Eurodance and techno music Giorgio Moroder who co wrote the song and was also one of its producers additionally created some of the earliest forms of electronic dance music Kraftwerk are also credited as influencing electronic music Whilst a lot of electronic dance music originates from disco this is not the case for all EDM

The song which has been credited as bringing EDM into mainstream popular music is Madonnas 1998 single Ray of Light Whilst it is attributed as helping bring the genre mainstream electronic dance music existed and had enjoyed popularity years before the singles release house music for instance had been popular in the United States since the early 1990s 

There are various different forms of EDM each varying in style and sound This is an incomplete list of some of the major electronic dance music genres

Scipionyx samniticus is one of the most important recent dinosaur finds is a tiny theropod fossil found in Cretaceous limestone in southern Italy near Naples Although it was unearthed 10 years ago its true importance was not realized until lately It is a very important specimen in that it has fossilized impressions of many of its internal organs and muscles This type of detail is rare in fossils since the soft tissues from an animal do not usually fossilize they almost always rot before mineral replacement can take place This new fossil will yield a lot of information about dinosaurs anatomy and physiology as it is studied

The fossils is a theropod perhaps a maniraptor It is a hatchling 95 inches long It is from 113 million years ago and has been named Scipionyx samniticus During the Cretaceous period it lived near a shallow lagoon

The Battle of Messines was a battle of the Western front of the First World War It began on 7 June 1917 when the British Second Army which was commanded by General Herbert Plumer launched an attack near the village of Mesen in West Flanders Belgium The attack was meant to capture a ridge which ran north from Messines village past Wytschaete village This made a natural stronghold southeast of Ypres One thing which happened during the battle which was unusual was that 19 mines were set off just before the infantry attack This was a tactic which made German defences disorganised This allowed the troops to do what they were supposed to do very quickly The attack also came before the much larger battle the Third Battle of Ypres usually known as Passchendaele which began on 11 July 1917

A phantom island is an island that was thought to exist at some point in time Because of this the island was shown on a map Later the islands were removed from maps Some islands are described and later on change their name or with the description given it is possible to associate a real island Other islands sink below sea level because of natural causes such as erosion Such islands still exist Two examples are Earnest Legouve Reef and Maria Theresa Reef in the South Pacific Because they are far away from ships routes their existence can not be proved so far In the year 1908 Robert Peary claimed to have found a lost continent called Crocker Land 

People such as Joo Vaz Corte Real were rewarded for finding islands that turned out to be phantom islands In the case given the phantom island was Bacalao The island showed up on maps in the early 16th century Baccalieu Island is probably named after the phantom island

Some phantom islands were later found That way Baja California was first thought to be an island Later people found it was in fact a peninsula Thule was discovered in antiquity in modern times people who found it may have talked about Norway the Orkney Islands Shetland or Scandinavia Other interpretations include Iceland Greenland or the island Saaremaa in the Baltic Sea

Other phantom islands may exist because of mistakes in navigation or optical illusions such as superior mirage One example of this is New South Greenland which was observed in the Weddell Sea in 1823 and has not been seen since 

Some phantom islands may have existed but they have been destroyed or are no longer above the water line These include Thompson Island in the South Atlantic and Bermeja off the coast of Yucatn

Edward Weston was an English born American chemist noted for his achievements in electroplating and his development of the electrochemical cell named the Weston cell for the voltage standard Weston was a competitor of Thomas Edison in the early days of electricity generation and distribution

Born in Oswestry Shropshire England in 1850 to a merchant family Weston first studied medicine but grew interested in chemistry He emigrated to the United States after receiving his medical diploma in 1870 He then found a job in the electroplating industry He saw the need for a constant source of current He developed an interest in power generation and invented several dynamos and generators He eventually co founded the Weston Electric Light Company in Newark New Jersey and later got the contract to light the Brooklyn Bridge Weston was a founding member of the board of trustees of what later became the New Jersey Institute of Technology Some of his inventions instruments and writings are maintained at the universitys library and at its Weston Museum Weston was president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers from 1888 89

He invented two alloys constantan and manganin Weston developed measurement instruments for electrical current the modern foundation for the voltmeter ammeter and wattmeter In 1888 he formed the Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation which was known for its voltmeters ammeters wattmeters ohmmeters frequency meters transformers and transducers Weston developed a method for producing a true permanent magnet Weston conceived of and built a magnetic speedometer Weston also developed the dashboard ammeter for Harley Davidson motorcycles 

Weston invented and patented the saturated cadmium cell in 1893 The cathode in the cell is an amalgam of cadmium with mercury The anode is of pure mercury and the electrolyte is a solution of cadmium sulphate The Weston cell is a wet chemical cell that produces a highly stable voltage suitable as a laboratory standard for calibration of voltmeters The temperature coefficient was reduced by shifting to an unsaturated design the predominant type today When the Weston cell became the International Standard for EMF in 1911 Weston waived his patent rights

Weston died in Montclair New Jersey in 1936 He got 309 United States patents during his life

Westons son Edward Faraday Weston received several patents regarding exposure meters also manufactured by the Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation and widely distributed since the 1930s and established the system of the Weston film speed ratings for the measurement of film speeds

Crocker Land is the name for a supposed eighth continent in the Arctic Ocean In the year 1906 Robert Peary thought he had seen a landmass which he named after George Crocker a member of Peary Arctic Club He thought that the land was about 130 miles north of Ellesmere Island at 83 degrees north and 100 degrees west 

In 1913 the Crocker Land expedition started to find Crocker Land This expedition turned out to be a failure The captain of the first ship became drunk and ran aground on the rocks Later an Inuit guide was deliberately shot and killed by one of the expedition members under suspicious circumstances The expedition eventually became stranded and was not rescued until four years later

The MacGregor Arctic Expedition in 19371938 also took aerial photographs These show that there is no land at that location Despite this some pseudo scientific organizations still try to present a case for its possible existence

The expedition did not find Crocker Land Later satellite images showed that the continent did not exist and could not be found Today it is believed that what Peary saw was a fata morgana mirage

Bradley Land is the name of a landmass Frederick Cook claimed to have seen during a expedition in 1909 He said the land between positions and He described it as two masses of land with a break a strait or an indentation between The land was named for John R Bradley who had sponsored Cooks expedition

Cook published two photographs of the land and described it as follows The lower coast resembled Heiberg Island with mountains and high valleys The upper coast I estimated as being about one thousand feet high flat and covered with a thin sheet ice 

It is now known there is no land at that location Cooks observations were based on either a misidentification of sea ice or an outright fabrication Cooks Inuit companions reported that the photographs were actually taken near the coast of Axel Heiberg Island

The United States civil rights movement was a United States political movement for equality before the law Most events were between 1865 and 1980 Many times it used civil resistance and nonviolent forms of resistance Some events went with or followed civil unrest and armed rebellion The process was long and uneven The groups targeted for discrimination included African Americans immigrants Jews Catholics women and other minorities It had a long and important history

The period between 1865 and 1895 saw tremendous change in the fortunes of the black community following the elimination of slavery in the South The year 1865 held two important events in the history of blacks the Thirteenth Amendment which eliminated slavery was ratified and Union troops arrived the last of the Confederate states to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation Freedmen looked to start new lives as the country recovered from the destruction of the Civil War

Immediately following the Civil War the federal government began a program known as Reconstruction to rebuild the states of the former Confederacy The federal programs also provided aid to the former slaves and attempted to integrate them into society During and after this period blacks made substantial gains in political power and many were able to move from poverty into the middle class Congress also passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Civil Rights Act of 1871 At the same time resentment by many whites toward these gains led to unprecedented violence and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan The Ku Klux Klan directed violence against blacks immigrants Jews and Catholics Reconstruction ended in 1876 and the federal troops that had been enforcing equal rights were removed from the South

During the Civil War the first Morrill Act established land grant universities in each state However the Southern states blocked black students from attending those colleges So Congress passed a second Morrill Act in 1890 to force states with all white land grant colleges to establish separate land grant colleges to serve blacks Many of the historically black colleges in the United States started under this law

Following the Civil War some courts tried to protect the civil rights of minorities Throughout the post war period anti progressives tried to curtail these efforts In 1896 the Supreme Court decided Plessy v Ferguson 163 US 537 which upheld separate but equal racial segregation This proved a major setback to civil rights efforts This case and other events in the 1890s reversed the progress made in the 19th century for civil rights

Much of the early reform movement during this era was spearheaded by the Radical Republicans a splinter group of the Republican Party which rejoined the mainstream party after Reconstruction But by the end of the century the so called Lily White Movement had managed to substantially weaken the power of blacks in the party The most important civil rights leaders of this period were Frederick Douglass and Booker T Washington

Civil rights advocates conducted a series of nation wide campaigns to add protections to the Constitution

Following the end of Reconstruction many blacks feared the Ku Klux Klan the White League and the Jim Crow laws which continued to make them second class citizens Lead by Benjamin Pap Singleton and others as many as forty thousand Exodusters left the South in the Exodus of 1879 They settle moved to Kansas Oklahoma and Colorado This was the first general migration of blacks following the Civil War In the 1880s blacks bought more than convert20000acrekm2 of land in Kansas This sudden wave of migration came as a great surprise to many white Americans who did not realize that black southerners were free in name only Many blacks left the South with the belief that they were receiving free passage to Kansas only to be stranded in St Louis Missouri Black churches in St Louis together with Eastern philanthropists formed the Colored Relief Board and the Kansas Freedmens Aid Society to help those stranded in St Louis to reach Kansas

One particular group was the Kansas Fever Exodus which consisted of six thousand blacks who moved from Mississippi Louisiana and Texas to Kansas Many black in Louisiana decided to leave the state when the 1879 Louisiana Constitutional Convention decided that voting rights were a matter for the state not federal government thereby clearing the way for the disenfranchisement of Louisianas black population

The exodus was not universally praised by African Americans indeed Frederick Douglass was a critic Douglass felt that the movement was ill timed and poorly organized

The election of a President in 1876 resulted in the end of Reconstruction Whites in the South regained political control of the region by using intimidation and violence the following elections Southern states removed blacks voting rights from 1890 to 1908 and continued until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid 1960s For more than 60 years for example no blacks in the South were elected to the Congress or local government

During this period the white dominated Democratic Party regained political control over the South Most blacks had belonged to the Republican Party That party became insignificant in the south as black voter registration was suppressed By the early 20th century almost all elected officials in the South were Democratscitation neededdateDecember 2011

Whites also enacted segregation laws Violence against blacks and immigrants increased The system of overt state sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that grew out of the post Reconstruction South became known as the Jim Crow system It remained virtually intact into the early 1950s So some people call the early 20th century the nadir of American race relations While problems and civil rights violations were most intense in the South social tensions affected blacks in other regions as well

The post Reconstruction period had the following features

Minorities resisted this in many ways They sought better opportunities through lawsuits new organizations political redress and labor organizing The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was founded in 1909 It fought to end race discrimination through litigation education and lobbying efforts Its best achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision Brown v Board of Education that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the separate but equal doctrine established in Plessy v Ferguson

The situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better From 1910 to 1970 many blacks sought better lives by migrating north and west A total of nearly seven million blacks left the South in what some people called the great migration

The legal victory of Brown did not produce immediate results So some private citizens rejected gradualist legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about desegregation Proponents of racial segregation and voter suppression responded to Brown with massive resistance in the South In response civil rights leaders adopted a combined strategy of direct action with nonviolent resistance known as civil disobedience

In the first half of the 20th Century the movement used a strategy of public education legislative lobbying and court litigation After Brown the movement shifted to direct action primarily boycotts sit ins Freedom Rides marches and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience From 1960 to 1968 the civil rights movement mostly used direct action tactics

Churches local grassroots organizations fraternal societies and black owned businesses mobilized volunteers to participate in broad based actions Some leaders thought that protests would be faster than court challenges in getting change

In 1947 several hundred black students from Morgan State University protested at the state capital seeking better funding for Marylands segregated colleges

In 1952 the Regional Council of Negro Leadership led by T R M Howard a black surgeon entrepreneur and planter organized a successful boycott of gas stations in Mississippi that refused to provide restrooms for blacks Through the RCNL Howard led campaigns to expose brutality by the Mississippi state highway patrol and to encourage blacks to make deposits in the black owned Tri State Bank of Nashville which in turn gave loans to civil rights activists who were victims of a credit squeeze by the white citizens councils 

The Montgomery Improvement Associationcreated to lead the Montgomery bus boycott managed to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses The success in Montgomery made its leader Martin Luther King Jr a nationally known figure It also inspired other bus boycotts such as the Tallahassee Florida boycott of 19561957

In 1957 King and Rev John Duffy the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts such as Rev C K Steele of Tallahassee and Rev T J Jemison of Baton Rouge and other activists such as Rev Fred Shuttlesworth Ella Baker A Philip Randolph Bayard Rustin and Stanley Levison to form the Southern Christian Leadership Conference The SCLC offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation The headquarters organization raised funds mostly from Northern sources to support such campaigns Non violence was both SCLCs central tenet and its primary method of challenging racism

In 1959 volunteers started adult education programs to help blacks pass the voter literacy tests

By 1950 public primary and secondary schools were segregated In the South segregation was enacted into law and in the North segregation resulted from housing patterns In many places the white public schools received more money than did the black schools At this point the Supreme Court ordered that black students had the right to attend public white professional schools if schools of similar quality were not available to blacks Sweatt v Painter 339 US 629 This prompted a sudden effort in the South to improve black schools to avoid racial integration

In Spring 1951 Moton High School in Prince Edward County was segregated Its black students protested against two things school buildings too small for the number of students and the bad school conditions Whites were surprised by the protests At first some local leaders of the NAACP had tried to persuade the students to back down When the students did not accept the NAACPs demands the NAACP automatically joined them in their battle against school segregation This became one of the five cases that became the Brown v Board of Education of Topeka Kansas case

On May 17 1954 the US Supreme Court handed down its decision regarding the five cases The plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from white children was unconstitutional The opinion of the Court stated that the segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group

The Court in Brown ruled that both Plessy v Ferguson which had established the segregationist separate but equal standard in general and Cumming v Richmond County Board of Education which had applied that standard to schools were unconstitutional The following year the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time with all deliberate speed In response some white political leaders announced a policy of massive resistance to maintain segregated schools

On May 18 1954 Greensboro North Carolina became the first city in the South to publicly announce that it would abide by the Brown decision It is unthinkable remarked School Board Superintendent Benjamin Smith that we will try to override the laws of the United States In agreement with Smiths position the school board voted six to one to support the courts ruling Greensboro also appointed anAfrican American to the school board in 1953 Integration in Greensboro occurred rather peacefully compared to that of other Southern states such as Alabama Arkansas and Virginia where massive resistance took hold

On December 1 1955 Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the Highlander Center in Tennessee At that meeting she learned about nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy Parks was convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance After word of this incident reached the black community 50 black leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery bus boycott to demand a more humane bus transportation system However after many reforms were rejected the NAACP pushed for full desegregation of public buses With the support of most of Montgomerys 50000 blacks the boycott lasted for 381 days Ninety percent of blacks in Montgomery boycotted the buses which reduced bus revenue by 80 The boycott ended when a federal court ordered Montgomerys buses desegregated in November 1956

A young Baptist minister named Martin Luther King Jr was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association the organization that directed the boycott The protest made King a national figure His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South

Little Rock Arkansas was in a relatively progressive Southern state but had segregated public schools A Federal court ordered that nine black student could attend Little Rock Central High School Governor of Arkansas Orval Faubus called out the National Guard on September 4 1957 to stop them The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades On the first day of school only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school She was harassed by white protesters outside the school and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her Afterward the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in jeeps

President Dwight D Eisenhower overturned Faubus order Eisenhower was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts Eisenhower federalized the National Guard and ordered them to return to their barracks Eisenhower then sent the US Army to Little Rock to protect the students

The students were able to attend high school They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year Although federal troops escorted the students between classes the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers were not around One of the Little Rock Nine Minnijean Brown was suspended for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line Later she was expelled for verbally abusing a white female student

Only one of the Little Rock Nine Ernest Green got the chance to graduate after the 195758 school year was over the Little Rock school system closed rather than continue to integrate Other public school systems across the South also closed

In 1953 students from Morgan State University started to protest segregation by seeking service a white lunch counters and restaurants in Baltimore Maryland After two years of protests Reads drug store opened its lunch counter to blacks in 1955 The civil rights movement was renewed with a student sit in at a Woolworths store in Greensboro North Carolina On February 1 1960 four students from North Carolina Agricultural Technical College Other sit ins followed in Richmond Virginia Nashville Tennessee and Atlanta Georgia

As students across the south began to sit in at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores local authority figures sometimes used force to remove the demonstrators from the lunch facilities

The sit in technique was not new in 1939 African American attorney Samuel Wilbert Tucker organized a sit in at the then segregated Alexandria Virginia library In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement The success of the sit ins led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South Probably the best organized most highly disciplined the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville Tennessee

On March 9 1960 an Atlanta University Center group of students released An Appeal for Human Rights as a full page advertisement in newspapers including the Atlanta Constitution Atlanta Journal and Atlanta Daily World This student group known as the Committee on the Appeal for Human Rights initiated the Atlanta Student Movement and began to lead Atlanta sit ins starting on March 15 1960

By the end of 1960 the sit ins had spread to every southern every border state and even to Nevada Illinois and Ohio

Demonstrators integrated not only on lunch counters but also on parks beaches libraries theaters museums and other public places Upon being arrested student demonstrators made jail no bail pledges to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food

In April 1960 activists who had led these sit ins held a conference at Shaw University in Raleigh North Carolina that led to the formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee SNCC took these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further to the freedom rides

Most interstate bus lines and their bus stations were segregated The United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v Virginia 364 US 454 ended segregation for passengers traveling interstate Freedom rides were trips by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to see if towns would comply

Freedom riders wanted to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals including restrooms and water fountains That proved to be a dangerous mission In Anniston Alabama one bus was firebombed forcing its passengers to flee for their lives In Birmingham Alabama an FBI informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene Bull Connor gave Ku Klux Klan members fifteen minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police protect them The riders were severely beaten until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them James Peck a white activist was beaten so hard he required fifty stitches to his headCitation neededdateSeptember 2010

Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides Then SNCC activists from Nashville brought in new riders to continue the journey from Birmingham The freedom riders continued their rides into Jackson Mississippi where they were arrested for breaching the peace by using white only facilities New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations As riders arrived in Jackson they were arrested By the end of summer more than 300 had been jailed in MississippiCitation neededdateSeptember 2010

The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly They were stuffed into tiny dirty cells and hit In Jackson Mississippi some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100 degree heat Others were transferred to Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed Sometimes the men were suspended by wrist breakers from the walls Typically the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days making it hard for them to breathecitation needed

Public sympathy and support for the freedom riders led the Kennedy administration to order the Interstate Commerce Commission to issue a new desegregation order When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1 1961 passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus white and colored signs came down in the terminals separate drinking fountains toilets and waiting rooms were consolidated and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color

After the freedom rides black leaders in Mississippi asked SNCC to help register black voters and to build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state The 1890 Mississippi constitution had provisions for poll taxes residency requirements and literacy tests Whites used these provisions to stop blacks from voting In the fall of 1961 the SNCC project to increase black voters was met with violence from state and local lawmen White Citizens Council and Ku Klux Klan The result was beatings hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee

White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the states civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success In 1962 representatives of SNCC CORE SCLC and the NAACP formed the Council of Federated Organizations 

In the Spring of 1962 with funds from the Voter Education Project SNCCCOFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area As in McComb their efforts were met with fierce oppositionarrests beatings shootings arson and murder Registrars used the literacy test to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that even highly educated people could not meet In addition employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes Over the following years the black voter registration campaign spread across the state

Similar voter registration campaignswith similar responseswere begun by SNCC CORE and SCLC in Louisiana Alabama southwest Georgia and South Carolina By 1963 voter registration campaigns in the South were as big a part of the civil rights movement as desegregation efforts After passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 the main effort of the civil rights movement shifted to protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers It resulted in passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965

By 1950 most higher education in the South was segregated Beginning in 1956 Clyde Kennard a black Korean War veteran tried to enroll at Mississippi Southern College under the GI Bill at Hattiesburg Kennard was twice arrested on trumped up charges and eventually convicted and sentenced to seven years in the state prison After three years at hard labor Kennard was paroled by Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett Journalists had investigated his case and publicized the states mistreatment of his colon cancer 

The colleges role in Kennards arrests and convictions is unknown In 2006 Judge Robert Helfrich ruled that Kennard was factually innocent of all charges for which he had been convicted in the 1950s

In September 1962 James Meredith won a lawsuit to secure admission to the previously segregated University of Mississippi He attempted to enter campus on September 20 on September 25 and again on September 26 He was blocked by Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett who said No school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor The Fifth US Circuit Court of Appeals held Barnett and Lieutenant Governor Paul B Johnson Jr in contempt with fines of more than 10000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll 

Attorney General Robert Kennedy sent US Marshals On September 30 1962 Meredith entered the campus under their escort Students and other whites began rioting that evening throwing rocks and then firing on the US Marshals guarding Meredith Two people were killed 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds and 160 others were injured After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus President John F Kennedy sent regular US Army forces to the campus to quell the riot Meredith began classes the day after the troops arrived

Kennard and other activists continued to work on public university desegregation In 1965 Raylawni Branch and Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong became the first African American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi By that time University President McCain helped ensure they had a peaceful entry

In 1963 Alabama Gov George Wallace announced in his inaugural address segregation now segregation tomorrow segregation forever as his policy He personally blocked the door to Foster Auditorium at the University of Alabama to prevent the enrollment of two black students He moved aside only when confronted by General Henry Graham of the Alabama National Guard who was ordered by President John F Kennedy to intervene

Many private universities did not admit blacks as well For example the University of Miami admitted its first black student in 1961

In 1972 Congress enacted Title IX which required all schools receiving federal aid to guarantee equal access to all programs and barred discrimination based on race religion or sex However it took years for some government owned schools to provide equal educational opportunities without gender discrimination Virginia fought opening Virginia Military Institute to women until it lost a 1996 Supreme Court decision

The SCLC which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in Albany Georgia in November 1961 King had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers faced So King himself worked to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders

The campaign failed due to tactics used by Laurie Pritchett the local police chief and divisions within the black community Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail Prichett also foresaw Kings presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid Kings rallying the black community King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories The local movement however continued It obtained significant gains in the next few years

The SCLC applied what it learned from Albany to its Birmingham campaign in 1963 SCLC Executive Director Wyatt Tee Walker carefully planned strategy and tactics for the campaign Unlike Albanys goal of city wide desegregation the goal in Brimingham was the desegregation of Birminghams downtown merchants The movements efforts were helped by the brutal response of local authorities in particular Eugene Bull Connor the Commissioner of Public Safety He had long held much political power but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate Refusing to accept the new mayors authority Connor intended to stay in office

The campaign used different peaceful ways of confrontation including sit ins kneel ins at local churches and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters The city however obtained an injunction barring all such protests Convinced that the order was unconstitutional the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters King elected to be among those arrested on April 12 1963

While in jail King wrote his Letter from Birmingham Jail Supporters appealed to the Kennedy administration which intervened to obtain Kings release

The campaign however was slowing down because the demonstrators willing to be arrested were already in jail James Bevel SCLCs Director of Direct Action and Nonviolent Education came up with a bold and controversial alternative to train high school students to take part in the demonstrations As a result more than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to meet at the 16th Street Baptist Church to join the demonstrations in what would come to be called the Childrens Crusade More than six hundred ended up in jail This was newsworthy but in this first encounter the police acted with restraint On the next day however another one thousand students gathered at the church When they started marching Connor unleashed police dogs on them then turned the citys fire hoses water streams on the children Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators

Widespread public outrage led the Kennedy administration to come in more forcefully in negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC On May 10 the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices to arrange for the release of jailed protesters and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders Later opponents of the agreement bombed the Gaston Motel which housed the SCLCs unofficial headquarters The home of Kings brother the Reverend A D King was also bombed

Kennedy prepared to federalize the Alabama National Guard if the need arose Four months later on September 15 Ku Klux Klan members bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham killing four young girls

On June 11 1963 George Wallace Governor of Alabama tried to block the integration of the University of Alabama That evening President Kennedy addressed the nation on TV and radio with his historic civil rights speech The next day segregationists murdered civil rights leader Medgar Evers in Mississippi The next week as promised on June 19 1963 President Kennedy submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress

A Philip Randolph had planned a march on Washington DC in 1941 to support demands for elimination of employment discrimination in defense industries he called off the march when the Roosevelt administration met the demand by issuing Executive Order 8802 barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order

Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march which they proposed in 1962 The Kennedy administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success The march was held on August 28 1963

Unlike the planned 1941 march for which Randolph included only black led organizations in the planning the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations the more progressive wing of the labor movement and other liberal and religious organizations The march had six official goals

Of these the marchs major focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham

National media attention also greatly contributed to the marchs national exposure and probable impact

The march was a success although not without controversy An estimated 200000 to 300000 demonstrators gathered in front of the Lincoln Memorial where King delivered his I Have a Dream speech While many speakers applauded the Kennedy administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation John Lewis of SNCC took the administration to task for not doing more to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South

After the march King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy While the Kennedy administration appeared sincerely committed to passing the bill it was not clear that Congress would pass it But when President Kennedy was assassinated on November 22 1963 the new President Lyndon Johnson decided to use his influence in Congress to bring about much of Kennedys legislative agenda

St Augustine was another battle leading to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Robert B Hayling a black dentist and Air Force veteran led a protest of segregated local institutions starting in 1963 Ku Klux Klan beat Hayling and three companions in the autumn of 1963 Nightriders shot into black homes and four teenagers spent six months in jail and reform school after sitting in at the local Woolworths lunch counter It took a special action of the governor and cabinet of Florida to release them after national protests by the Pittsburgh Courier Jackie Robinson and others

In 1964 Hayling and other activists invited the SCLC to come to St Augustine The first action came during spring break when Hayling appealed to northern college students to come to the city not to go to the beach but to take part in demonstrations Four prominent Massachusetts womenMrs Mary Parkman Peabody Mrs Esther Burgess Mrs Hester Campbell and Mrs Florence Rowe came to lend their support and the arrest of Mrs Peabody the 72 year old mother of the governor of Massachusetts for attempting to eat at the segregated Ponce de Leon Motor Lodge in an integrated group made front page news across the country

Widely publicized activities continued in the ensuing months as Congress conducted the longest filibuster against a civil rights bill in its history Martin Luther King Jr was arrested at the Monson Motel in St Augustine on June 11 1964 He sent a Letter from the St Augustine Jail to a northern supporter Rabbi Israel Dresner of New Jersey urging him to recruit others to participate in the movement This resulted a week later in the largest mass arrest of rabbis in American historywhile conducting a pray in at the Monson Motel

One photograph taken in St Augustine shows the manager of the Monson Motel pouring acid in the swimming pool while blacks and whites are swimming in it The photograph was run on the front page of the Washington newspaper the day the senate went to vote on passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964

In the summer of 1964 COFO brought nearly 1000 activists to Mississippimost of them white college studentsto join with local black activists to register voters teach in Freedom Schools and organize the MFDP

Many of Mississippis white residents resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society State and local governments police the White Citizens Council and the Ku Klux Klan used arrests beatings arson murder spying firing and evictions and other forms to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality

In June 1964 three civil rights workers were murdered by local members of the Klan some of them members of the Neshoba County sheriffs department This outraged the public leading the US Justice Department along with the FBI to take action The outrage over these murders helped lead to the passage of the Civil Rights Act

From June to August Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state with the largest number concentrated in the Mississippi Delta region They staffed at least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3500 students They set up 28 community centers

Over the course of the Summer Project some 17000 Mississippi blacks attempted to register to voter only 1600 succeeded But more than 80000 joined the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party founded as an alternative to the segregationist controlled local Democratic Party

Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement It encouraged individuals to demand their rights Before Freedom Summer the national news media had paid little attention to the harassment of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by civil rights workers The progression of events throughout the South increased media attention to Mississippi The deaths of affluent northern white students and threats to other northerners attracted the full attention of the media spotlight to the state Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers almost all of whomblack and whitestill consider it to have been one of the defining periods of their lives

Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 19th century In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote More than 80000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the Freedom Party against the official state Democratic Party candidates

In 1964 organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party to challenge the all white official party Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates to run in the Democratic primary So MFDP held its own primary They selected Fannie Lou Hamer Annie Devine and Victoria Gray to run for Congress and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention They sought to replace the delegates from the white Mississippi Democratic Party

The MFDP asked to be included in the Convention at a televised meeting of the Credentials Committee Johnsons representatives offered the MFDP two non voting at large seats while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its voting seats The MFDP angrily rejected the compromise So no MFDP delegates were seated

On December 10 1964 Dr Martin Luther King Jr was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize the youngest man to receive the award he was 35 years of age

The Civil Rights Movement helped to enact federal laws Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned discrimination based on race color religion or national origin in employment practices and public accommodations The Voting Rights Act of 1965 restored and protected voting rights The Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 opened entry to the US to immigrants other than traditional European groups The Fair Housing Act of 1968 banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing Blacks re entered politics in the South and other groups also exercised their rights under the new laws

SNCC started a voter registration program in Selma Alabama in 1963 But by 1965 few black voters had registered Selmas sheriff Jim Clark opposed blacks voting After local residents asked the SCLC for assistance King came to Selma to lead several marches at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators Police used violence against the marchers One marcher was killed on February 17 1965

On March 7 1965 Hosea Williams of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery Alabama State troopers and local police attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs tear gas rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips They drove the marchers back into Selma John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized

Thompson Island is a phantom island in the South Atlantic It was thought to be about 150 km north northeast of Bouvet Island 

Jean Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier discovered Bouvet Island in 1739 In 1808 James Lindsay of the Snow Swan discovered Bouvet Island again and named it Lindsay Island The next time George Norris of the Sprightly sighted Bouvet on 10 December 1825 He landed on 16 December and took possession of the island which he named Liverpool Island for King George IV of the United Kingdom

Between December 13 and December 16 Norris sailed the waters northeast of Bouvet Island where he discovered another island It was much smaller and the sea around it was much rougher Three miles southeast of the newly discovered island he found three rocks In his log he named the newly found island Thompson Island and the rocks chimneys because of their form He also marked the position of his discoveries on a map Unfortunately the positions of the islands on the map did not match those written down in the log In 1853 the discoveries of Thompson Island Bouvet Island and the Chimneys showed up on an official map of the British admiralty 

In 1893 Captain Joseph J Fuller reported another sighting of Thompson Island on his ship Francis Allyn

The Valdivia expedition wanted to find the exact position of Bouvet and Thompson Island in November 1898 but was unable to find Thompson Island

In 1915 a German ship the Meteor gave a depth of the sea of 1579 m at the position where Thompson had been reported If Thompson ever existed it is probable that it disappeared in a volcanic eruption sometime in the 1890s

The Norwegian Arctic Expedition failed to find Thompson Island and declared it did not exist

Thompson Island continued to appear on maps published as late as 1943

The only person to have seen Thompson Island was probably Norris Fullers description of Thompson Island matches more or less that given of Bouvet Island in Norris diary and is therefore questionable 

Daniel Carleton Gajdusek was an American physician and medical researcher He and Baruch S Blumberg won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1976 They got the Nobel for work on kuru Kuru is the first human prion disease shown to be infectious 

Gajduseks father Karol Gajdusek was from Bdsk Kingdom of Hungary now Smrdky Slovakia He was an ethnic Slovak who was a butcher His mothers parents from Debrecen Hungary Gajdusek was born in Yonkers New York He graduated from the University of Rochester in 1943 Gajdusek studied physics biology chemistry and mathematics He got an MD from Harvard University in 1946 His postdoctoral research was done at Columbia University the California Institute of Technology and Harvard In the early 1950s Gajdusek was drafted into the military as a research virologist at Walter Reed Army Medical Center In 1954 he went to work at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne Australia In Australia he began the work that led to his getting the Nobel Prize

Gajduseks best known work was on kuru This disease was affecting many people among the South Fore people of New Guinea in the 1950s and 1960s Gajdusek felt there was a connect between the spread of the disease and the funerary cannibalism by the South Fore people He lived among the Fore and studied their language and culture He also performed autopsies on people who died of kuru

Gajdusek thought that that kuru was spread by the ritualistic eating of the brains of dead family members He proved this idea by infecting primates with the disease and showing that it had an very long incubation period of several years When the cannibalism was stopped kuru stopped spreading in just one generation This was the first time it was shown that a non inflammatory degenerative disease could be spread in humans

Gajdusek was not able to identify what exactly spreads kuru Other research by Stanley Prusiner and others led to the finding of proteins called prions that caused these disease and other similar diseases 

Some people in the medical community do not think that cannibalism was still practiced when Gajdusek did his research Willam Arens an anthropologist says that Gajdusek never saw cannibalism himself Researchers who worked with the Fore in the 1950s say that cannibalism was stopped in 1948 This was almost a decade before Gajdusek went to New Guinea Many other researchers including Robert Klitzman S Lindenbaum R Glasse and researchers at the Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research have made reports that say that the cannibalism still happened 

Gajdusek became head of the laboratories for virological and neurological research at the National Institutes of Health in 1958 He was made a part of the National Academy of Sciences in 1974

During his trips in the South Pacific Gajdusek had brought 56 children back to live with him in the United States He gave them the chance to have high school and college education Later as an adult one of these children said that Gajdusek molested him as a child 

Gajdusek was charged with child molestation in April 1996 This was based on things in his own diary and what the victim told police He said this was true in 1997 and was sent to jail for 12 months After he got out of jail in 1998 he went to Europe He never returned to the United States and lived in Amsterdam Paris and Troms Gajdusek openly admits to molesting boys and his approval of incest

Gajdusek died December 12 2008 in Troms Norway at the age of 85

Hard Again is a album by Muddy Waters It was produced by Johnny Winter who also played guitar The record was his first for Blue Sky Records It was also the first studio album after he left Chess Records 

The recordings lasted three days For the recordings Muddy used his then current touring band of guitarist Bob Margolin pianist Pinetop Perkins and drummer Willie Big Eyes Smith James Cotton played harmonica and Charles Calmeses the bass

Three of the songs on the album Mannish Boy I Want to Be Loved and I Cant Be Satisfied were re recordings of songs for Chess Records One of the songs recorded The Blues Had a Baby and They Named It Rock and Roll Pt 2 was co written by Brownie McGhee and another song Bus Driver was co written by T Abrahamson

An outtake from the recording sessions Walking Through the Park appeared on the 2004 Legacy Recordings reissue CD while several more unused tracks appeared on King Bee in 1981

The album has been well received by several critics Dan Oppenheimer of Rolling Stone magazine said that Mannish Boy sounded like it was recorded live while both Oppenheimer and Daniel Gioffre of Allmusic state how powerful Willie Big Eyes Smiths drumming is Oppenheimer Gioffre and Robert Christgau all share the opinion that Hard Again is Muddy Waters comeback album

Hard Again peaked at 143 on the Billboard 200 which was his first appearance on the chart since Fathers and Sons in 1969

All songs written by McKinley Morganfield except where others are noted

Walking Through the Park 355

The British tried to control all of southern Africa in the 19th Century They won control of the Cape of Good Hope in 1815 at the end of the Napoleonic Wars Many Boers consisting out of Dutch German and Frence farmers did not like Britain controlling the area Some of them moved north and made a new country called the Orange Free State In 1877 the British Army moved in to control the Orange Free State in pursuit of diamonds one of the Orange Free States rich natural resourcesFrom 1896 to 1899 Governor of the Cape and High Commissioner for South Africa Alfred Milner made preparations for war in order to gain the wealth of the Orange Free State and in September 1899 British troops arrived in South Africa Paul Kruger president of the Transvaal sent Britain an ultimatum asking strongly for their departure The British refused and on 16 December 1880 the First Boer War began Boer farmers from Sandspruit Volksrust the Orange Free State the Transvaal and the Germans fought in the war As the Boers lost men in battle they recruited young boys and old men to fight Black people also fought alongside the Boers in the war and they made up 20 to 25 percent of total Boer manpower The Boers used Krupp guns to fight and fought on horseback As the Boers lost battle after battle they were eventually forced to make peace on the 23rd of March 1902 and surrender to British authority

Lilly Ledbetter was the plaintiff in the American employment discrimination case Ledbetter v Goodyear Tire Rubber Co She has since become a womens equality activist

Goodyear paid Ledbetter significantly less than men holding the same job This violated the Equal Pay Act of 1963 which said that she could sue to get the pay difference Her lawsuit eventually reached the Supreme Court The court said that she waited too long to sue Goodyear In response to the court decision Congress passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 which is named after her Under the new law other women will be able to get backpay after employers keep pay discrimination secret

United States Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg statedLilly 

Ledbetter was a supervisor at Goodyear Tire and Rubbers plant in Gadsden Alabama from 1979 until her retirement in 1998 For most of those years she worked as an area manager a position largely occupied by men Initially Ledbetters salary was in line with the salaries of men performing substantially similar work Over time however her pay slipped in comparison to the pay of male area managers with equal or less seniority By the end of 1997 Ledbetter was the only woman working as an area manager and the pay discrepancy between Ledbetter and her 15 male counterparts was stark Ledbetter was paid 3727 per month the lowest paid male area manager received 4286 per month the highest paid 5236

On August 26 2008 Ledbetter spoke at the Democratic National Convention on the topic of pay equity

In June 2011 she dined with New York Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney who introduced the Equal Rights Amendment the previous month and Eleanor Smeal 

The German Democratic Republic or East Germany sent athletes to the Olympic Games from 1956 until 1988 They have taken part in both the Summer and Winter Games From 1956 through 1966 East German athletes were a part of a combined team from both East and West Germany After 1966 the East Germans were a separate team They won a total of 519 medals at the Olympics

Germany was divided after World War II Three separate states were created German athletes tried to take part in the 1948 games but the Allies did not let this happen Finally in 1949 the National Olympic Committee for Germany was founded in the Western Federal Republic of Germany The IOC accepted it as both of the larger two larger German states The small French occupied Saarland and its NOC were separate until after 1955 

East German authorities of the Nationales Olympisches Komitee fr Ostdeutschland did not send their athletes to the 1952 games in an all German team The wanted a team of their own This was not allowed by the IOC

East Germany agreed to take part in the 1956 Games German athletes from the East and West Germany took part in the games in 1956 1960 and 1964 as the United Team of Germany This team was just called Germany at the time 

The GDR renamed their NOC to Nationales Olympisches Komitee der DDR in 1965 It was accepted by the IOC in 1968 At this point East Germany sent its own team to the Games They did not take part in the in 1984 Summer Olympics due to the Soviet boycott

Although East Germany had a small population of about 16 million they did very well From 1976 to 1988 they won the second most medals in each of their three summer Olympics behind the Soviet Union They did much better than the West Germany In five winter games they placed second four times and first in the 1984 Winter Olympics

Many think that doping allowed East Germany to a world leader in sports for two decades They won a large number of Olympic and world gold medals but many athletes failed doping tests or were believed to be taking performance enhancing drugs In many cases where doping was believed to happen no proof was found so most of records and medals won by East German athletes still stand Aside from doping East Germany soent a lot of money on sporta  mainly Olympic sports They did this for prestige propaganda and rivalry with West Germany The government did a lot of work to find and train athletes and coaches that they believed would do very well This made it hard say that it was doping rather than very good performance that was the reason for them winning so much 

In 1990 the German reformed back into Germany The NOC of the GDR joined the NOC of Germany on 17 November 1990 The German athletes took part in the Olympic Games in a single team again from 1992 forward During the first decade after this athletes from the Eastern part of Germany still won a large number of Germanys medals This shows that doping was not the only reason East Germany did so well in the Olympics It shows that their training conditions were also very important  As trainers and athletes started to move freely around the country this difference between east and west became smaller 

Sonar is a machine that uses underwater sound waves to find other objects in the sea A sonar can work by sending out sound and listening for echoes like a radar or by listening for sound made by the object it is trying to find

The basic parts of an active sonar are here

The transmitter creates the sound waves

The hydrophone or hydrophone array converts the sound waves into electricity 

By doing this the sonar can find what place the object is at 

Active sonar was first used in 1917 by Paul Langevin 

The word SONAR was created during the Second World War as an acronym for Sound Navigation and Ranging This acronym replaced the British acronym ASDIC The word is now thought by many people as a regular word no longer as an acronym 

Rococo is an artistic style which originated in the 18th century in France Often referred to merely as Late Baroque the Rococo developed from the Baroque artistic movement Whilst it kept several characteristics of the original style including elaboration and ornate themes it was also more playful and asymmetrical The Rococo is associated with the reign of French king Louis XV Rococos popularity was at its height towards the middle of the 18th century fading out by the end in favour of Neoclassicism 

Rococo art and architecture was feminine graceful florid and ornate Creamy and pastel like colours were used for paintings unlike the darker shades in Baroque art Religion and politics were no longer necessarily the core theme of Rococo art unlike the Baroque and everyday life became more commonly represented In such a way Rococo art was centred around themes such as love romance fun landscapes and mere portraits Additionally Far Eastern themes became popular in Rococo especially Chinoiserie Famous Rococo artists include Boucher Watteau and Fragonard amongst several others

The Rococo has been the focus of much discussion analysis and criticism by art historians throughout history It has been criticised over the years for being over the top superficial and frivolous in such a way the term has even been used derogatively in various points of history Nevertheless Rococo art and theatre has also received praise for the elegance beauty and charm of its artwork

Azerbaijani food is what people cook and eat in Azerbaijan Foods from different cultures have influenced Azerbaijani However it remained different from foods in other countries Many foods that started in Azerbaijan are now part of other cultures For the Azerbaijanis food is an important part of the countrys culture and is very connected with the history traditions and values of the nation 

Out of 11 climate types in the world the Azerbaijan has nine This adds to the fertility of the soil so there are many kinds of vegetables used according to seasons and the dishes The climate helps to create the richness of the food Fresh herbs including mint coriander dill basil parsley tarragon leek chive thyme marjoram green onion and watercress are very popular and are often put in the main dishes The Caspian Sea has many edible species of fish including the sturgeon Caspian salmon kutum sardines grey mullet and others Black caviar from the Caspian Sea is one of Azerbaijans best known delicacies wanted in many parts of the world

The main courses of Azerbaijani cuisine are over 30 kinds of soups including those prepared from plain yogurt One of the most famous dishes is plov Plov is a saffron covered rice served with different herbs The Azerbaijani cuisine has more than 40 different plov recipes Other second courses include many kinds of kebabs and shashliks including lamb beef chicken and fish kebabs Sturgeon a common fish is normally skewered and grilled as a shashlik being served with a tart pomegranate sauce called narsharab Dried fruits and walnuts are used in many dishes The traditional condiments are salt the spices black pepper sumac and especially saffron Much of the saffron comes from the Absheron Peninsula 

Black tea is the national drink and is drunk after food is eaten It is also a popular on its own or with dried fruits 

Another popular drink is sherbet a sweet cold drink made of fruit juice mixed or boiled with sugar often perfumed with rose water Azerbaijani sherbet is not sorbet the cold dessert

A synchrotron is a type of particle accelerator where particles travel around many times in a circle It uses a magnetic field to turn the particles in the circle and the electric field to accelerate the particles The components are carefully synchronized with the travelling particle beam Mark Oliphant invented the proton synchrotron Vladimir Veksler was the first to publish the idea Edwin McMillan constructed the first electron synchrotron

The synchrotron is an improvement over the cyclotron where the particles travel in a spiral pattern A cyclotron uses a constant magnetic field and a constant frequency applied electric field Both of these fields are varied in the synchrotron to change the path from a spiral to a circle By increasing these parameters appropriately as the particles gain energy the diameters of the path can be held constant as the machine accelerates the particles This allows the vacuum chamber for the particles to be a large thin circular pipe torus It is easier to use some straight sections between the bending magnets and some bent sections within the magnets giving the torus the shape of a round cornered polygon A path of large effective radius can be constructed using simple straight and curved pipe segments unlike the disc shaped chamber of the cyclotron type devices The shape also requires the use of multiple magnets to bend the particle beams Straight sections are required at spacings around a ring for both radiofrequency cavities and in third generation setups space is allowed for insertion of energy extraction devices such as wigglers and undulators Most synchrotrons use two types of magnets dipole magnets to bend the particle beam and quadrupole magnets to focus the beam

The maximum energy that a cyclic accelerator can impart is typically limited by the strength of the magnetic field and the minimum radius of the particle path So over time physicist have built accelerators with bigger magnets and larger circles to reach higher particle energy levels

In a cyclotron the maximum radius is quite limited as the particles start at the center and spiral outward So the entire path must be a self supporting disc shaped vacuum chamber Since the radius is limited the power of the machine becomes limited by the strength of the magnetic field In the case of an ordinary electromagnet the field strength is limited by the saturation of the core The arrangement of the single pair of magnets the full width of the device also limits the economic size of the device

Synchrotrons overcome these limitations using a narrow beam pipe which can be surrounded by much smaller and more tightly focusing magnets The ability of this device to accelerate particles is limited by the fact that the particles must be charged to be accelerated at all but charged particles under acceleration emit photons thereby losing energy The limiting beam energy is reached when the energy lost to the lateral acceleration required to maintain the beam path in a circle equals the energy added each cycle More powerful accelerators are built by using large radius paths and by using more numerous and more powerful microwave cavities to accelerate the particle beam between corners Lighter particles lose a larger fraction of their energy when turning Practically speaking the energy of electronpositron accelerators is limited by this radiation loss while it does not play a significant role in the dynamics of proton or ion accelerators The energy of those is limited strictly by the strength of magnets and by the cost

Particles are injected into the main ring at substantial energies by either a linear accelerator or by an intermediate synchrotron which is in turn fed by a linear accelerator The linac is in turn fed by particles accelerated to intermediate energy by a simple high voltage power supply typically a Cockcroft Walton generator

Particles are designed to leave the linac at a specified speed for entry into the synchrotron The operators calculate the magnetic field strength needed to steer particles with the injection velocity on the path of the synchrotron The operators give the electromagnets enough current to create the right amount of magnetic field strength

Starting from that initial magnetic field strenght the magnetic field is then increased The particles pass through an electrostatic accelerator driven by a high alternating voltage At particle speeds not close to the speed of light the frequency of the accelerating voltage can be made roughly proportional to the current in the bending magnets A finer control of the frequency is performed by a servo loop which responds to the detection of the passing of the traveling group of particles At particle speeds approaching light speed the frequency becomes more nearly constant while the current in the bending magnets continues to increase The maximum energy that can be applied to the particles is determined by the saturation of the cores of the bending magnets One way to obtain additional power is to make the torus larger and add additional bending magnets This allows the amount of particle redirection at saturation to be less and so the particles can be more energetic Another means of obtaining higher power is to use superconducting magnets these not being limited by core saturation

When the particles have reached their maximum energy they are steered out of the synchrotron and aimed at a target Early synchrotrons used stationary targets In order to double the energy of a collision physicists in the 1970s began to collide two particle beams travelling in the opposite direction instead of just one beam and a stationary target To have two beams that are travelling in the synchrontron in opposite directions they used particles with the same mass but with the opposite sign For example electrons and positrons or protons and antiprotons

One of the early large synchrotrons now retired is the Bevatron constructed in 1950 at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory The name of this proton accelerator comes from its power in the range of 63 GeV A number of heavy elements unseen in the natural world were first created with this machine This site is also the location of one of the first large bubble chambers used to examine the results of the atomic collisions produced by the machine

Another early large synchrotron is the Cosmotron built at Brookhaven National Laboratory which reached 33 GeV in 1953 The first Cornell University synchrotron was built before 1950 with a power of 300 MeV

Until August 2008 the highest energy synchrotron in the world was the Tevatron at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in the United States It accelerates protons and antiprotons to slightly less than 1 TeV of kinetic energy and collides them together The Large Hadron Collider which has been built at the European Laboratory for High Energy Physics has roughly seven times this energy It is housed in the 27 km tunnel which formerly housed the Large Electron Positron collider so it will maintain the claim as the largest scientific device ever built The LHC will also accelerate heavy ions up to an energy of 115 PeV

The largest device of this type seriously proposed was the Superconducting Super Collider which was to be built in Texas This design like others used superconducting magnets which allow more intense magnetic fields to be created without the limitations of core saturation Its planned ring circumference was 871 kilometres with an energy of 20 TeV per beam of protons Construction was begun in 1991 but later cancelled in 1994 The project had been poorly managed Some people say that the end of the Cold War resulted in a change of scientific funding priorities that contributed to its ultimate cancellation

While there is still potential for yet more powerful proton and heavy particle cyclic accelerators it appears that the next step up in electron beam energy must avoid losses due to synchrotron radiation This will require a return to the linear accelerator but with devices significantly longer than those currently in use There is at present a major effort to design and build the International Linear Collider which will consist of two opposing linear accelerators one for electrons and one for positrons These will collide at a total center of mass energy of 05 TeV

However synchrotron radiation also has a wide range of applications and many 2nd and 3rd generation synchrotrons have been built especially to harness it The largest of those 3rd generation synchrotron light sources are the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble France the Advanced Photon Source near Chicago USA and SPring 8 in Japan accelerating electrons up to 6 7 and 8 GeV respectively

Synchrotrons which are useful for cutting edge research are large machines costing tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to construct and each beamline costs another two or three million dollars on average These installations are mostly built by the science funding agencies of governments of developed countries or by collaborations between several countries in a region and operated as infrastructure facilities available to scientists from universities and research organisations throughout the country region or world More compact models however have been developed such as the Compact Light Source

Jean Honor Fragonard was a French artist Today he is remembered as one of the most important French painters of the rococo style He was a pupil of Franois Boucher and developed Bouchers style further At first he did histroical paintngs but soon gave up on these and painted pleasurable and frivolous scenes much like Antoine Watteau Together with Boucher and Watteau he is one of the principal painters of French Rococo 

He lost his wealth during the French Revolution After the revolution the painting style was different Because he had trouble adapting he died a poor man He had a son Alexandre variste Fragonard who became painter and sculptor much like himself

In mathematics a system of linear equations is a collection of linear equations involving the same set of variables 

This method generalizes to systems with additional variables

Using computers to solve systems of linear equations is used every day For example it is used in weather forecasting models Hot dog factories use it to make small changes in the receipe as food ingredient prices change College cafeterias use it to figure out how much food to cook based on past experience when the cafeteria gives students the choice between multiple entrees

Franois Boucher was a French painter mostly known as one of the main artists of the French rococo movement He painted several portraits of his patroness Madame de Pompadour He is also known for his open minded voluptuous paintings

Neo Keynesian economics is a school of macroeconomic thought that was developed after World War II from the writings of John Maynard Keynes A group of economists attempted to interpret and formalize Keynes writings and to synthesize it with the neo classical models of economics This model the ISLM model is nearly as influential as Keynes original analysis in determining actual policy and economics education It relates aggregate demand and employment to three variables that is the amount of money in circulation the government budget and the state of business expectations This model was very popular with economists after World War II because it could be understood in terms of general equilibrium theory Their work has become known as the neo classical synthesis It created the models that formed the core ideas of neo Keynesian economics These ideas dominated mainstream economics in the post war period and formed the mainstream of macroeconomic thought in the 1950s 60s and 70s

In the 1970s a series of developments occurred that shook neo Keynesian theory The developed world suffered from slow economic growth and high inflation at the same time Also the work of monetarists like Milton Friedman cast doubt on neo Keynesian theories The result was a series of new ideas to bring tools to Keynesian analysis that would be capable of explaining the economic events of the 1970s The next great wave of Keynesian thinking began with the attempt to give Keynesian macroeconomic reasoning a microeconomic basis The new Keynesians helped create a new neo classical synthesis that currently forms the mainstream of macroeconomic theory Following the emergence of the new Keynesian school neo Keynesians have sometimes been referred to as Old Keynesians

The Herbert F Johnson Museum of Art is an art museum in Ithaca New York It is in the Arts Quad on the main campus of Cornell University It is best known for its unusual concrete facade The museum has more than 32000 pieces of art Each year over 80000 people go to the museum It shows over 20 special exhibitions each year

Cornell president Deane Waldo Malott started the University Art Museum in 1953 The A D White House was changed to hold Cornells art collections The current museum was built in 1973 It is named after Herbert Fisk Johnson Jr Johnson was head of SC Johnson Sons of Racine Wisconsin He was a former member of the universitys Board of Trustees He graduated in 1922 His son also served as a trustee

The Johnson Museum of Art was designed by architect IM Pei Many people say it looks like a sewing machine from the side Its fifth floor bridges over the open aired sculpture garden It was made so that it would not block the view of Cayuga Lake It has a very good view of the lake from its north and west sides It also has a room for meetings on the sixth floor This room was used for many years by Cornells Board of Trustees

The location of the museum caused many architectural problems There was a limited amount of space to build Also the building could not have a large affect on the view of the lake or the Arts Quad It is also located on the knoll where tradition said Ezra Cornell chose the site for his university at the north end of the Stone Row of Morrill McGraw and White Halls The design wanted to visually anchor the north end of Library Slope The final design was a narrow tower and a bridge Critics have said it looks like a giant sewing machine

One part of the design which was never built was an underground Asian art gallery It would have included windows that opened into the Southern face of Fall Creek Gorge

The building was awarded the American Institute of Architects Honor Award in 1975 The buildings design was used on the cover of Scientific American as an early example of computer graphics

In 2011 a new wing opened to help hold the museums increasing collection The new part mirrored the plans drawn up by Pei Cobb Freed Partners The architect in charge was John L Sullivan III He graduated Cornell in 1962 The convert16000sqftm2abbron project cost 22 million This included some changes to the main building The money for the project came from large grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Kresge Foundation The Asian art storage area was moved from the center of the fifth floor to the lower level of the section This allows them to make the public gallery space on the fifth floor larger Galleries in the new wing will be used to show contemporary art The upper level of the new section includes an outdoor Japanese garden The plans wanted a tunnel under Campus Road to be added It would have gone through the wall of the Fall Creek gorge This was not done because of environmental issues

The permanent collection has more than 32000 works of art Most notable is the George and Mary Rockwell Asian Art collection There are also a large number of works by American artists These artist include Stuart Davis and Robert Rauschenberg There is also many works by members of the Hudson River School and the American Impressionists to contemporary art The Collection of Prints Drawings and Photographs has more than 15000 works These include works by Berenice Abbott Robert Frank Alfred Stieglitz and Garry Winogrand The fifth floor observation level holds the museums large Asian collection The permanent collection also includes works from Africa pre Columbian America and Oceania It range from ancient to contemporary societies Its collection has two windows from Frank Lloyd Wrights Darwin D Martin House

Classes for credit are taught by Cornells academic departments not by the museum The museum does work with the teachers It has gallery sessions for some classes It also has gallery tours and course related exhibitions that are run by the faculty The museum also hosts thematic tours for local school student field trips Over 7000 schoolchildren go to the museum each year The Johnson Museum Club is a Cornell student group that promotes student awareness of the Johnson Museums collections exhibitions and resources It hosts concerts scavenger hunts and other events

The line of succession to the Danish throne is the list of people who may become King or Queen of Denmark

Since 2009 Danish law identifies the eldest child of a Danish monarch the royal heir The first born child follows his or her parent on the throne  This is known as full or equal primogeniture

In 2011 the current order of succession is clear

The order of succession is an ordered sequence of people and events in order and it may mean the passing of royal or other powers 

The order of succession may be used in a historical way such as a list of former leaders Also the phrase may mean the pre planned process through which a leader takes over from another because of death resignation or removal 

Succession becomes a chronology which has developed during time which has passed  like a list of popes or list of emperors of Japan 

Succession histories are unique but not always obvious For example Charles IX of Sweden was only the third Swedish king named Charles

Pope Benedict XVI is the 266th Pope of the Roman Catholic Church Saint Peter is listed as the first of 266 popes 

Across the span of centuries there have been problems with the list and order of succession after St Peter For example During the Western schism in the 14th century there was more than one pope at the same time Each had notable international support Only some are included on the chronology of todays list

At that time European leaders had to choose to support one pope or the other 

Akihito is the 125th Emperor of Japan Emperor Jimmu is listed as the first of 125 emperors

Across time there have been difficulties with the list and order of succession after Jimmu For example During the Nanboku ch period in the 14th century there was more than one emperor at the same time Each had notable support Only some are included in todays list

For 500 years the Imperial chronology included Emperor Kgon Emperor Kmy Emperor Suk Emperor Go Kgon and Emperor Go Eny In the 19th century these men were removed from the list At the same time Emperor Go Murakami Emperor Chkei and Emperor Go Kameyama were added

The order of succession or line of succession is a formal plan which determines who inherits a future role or a position in a hierarchy after death or other cause creates a vacancy or an opportunity for succession

Many countries have developed formal succession planning In contrast Kim Jong il of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea selected his youngest son as the Dear Successor or Great Successor The process which led to this choice is not known 

In some countries including Sweden since 1980 the Netherlands since 1983 Norway since 1990 Belgium since 1991 and Denmark since 2009 the eldest child of a monarch is expected to become the next monarch  This is known as full or equal as primogeniture

In many countries including the United Kingdom and Japan special preference is given to male children This is known as male primogeniture

In the United States the line of succession is explained in the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 If the president cannot fullfil his duties the Vice President is expected to take his place and then the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives is next

A synchrotron light source is a source of electromagnetic radiation produced by a synchrotron The radiation can be artificially produced for scientific and technical purposes by specialized particle accelerators typically by accelerating electrons Once the high energy electron beam has been generated it is directed into auxiliary components such as bending magnets and insertion devices in storage rings and free electron lasers These supply the strong magnetic fields perpendicular to the beam which are needed to convert the high energy electron energy into light or some other form of electronmagnetic radiation

Synchrotron radiation may occur in accelerators either as a nuisance in particle physics experiments or on purpose for many laboratory uses Electrons are accelerated to high speeds in several stages to achieve a final energy that can be in the GeV range In the Large Hadron Collider proton bunches also produce the radiation at increasing amplitude and frequency as they accelerate in the vacuum field making photoelectrons The photoelectrons then make secondary electrons from the pipe walls with increasing frequency and density up to 7x1010 Each proton may lose 67keV per turn due to this phenomenon So both electron synchrotrons and proton synchrotrons can be a light source

The major applications of synchrotron light are in condensed matter physics materials science biology and medicine Many experiments using synchrotron light probe the structure of matter from the sub nanometer level of electronic structure to the micrometer and millimeter level This is important in medical imaging An example of a practical industrial application is the manufacturing of microstructures by the Lithography Electroplating and Molding process

A hawker is a person who sells things that can be easily moved from place to place They are also known as peddlers costermongers or street vendors Hawkers often sell food They attract attention by calling out singing chants and interacting loudly with customers While hawkers can be found in markets they often move their products from place to place in small carts In 19th century Australia the hawkers travelled around to distant towns and remote farms carrying a large range of items to sell in horse drawn wagons

A disc detainer lock also called a disc tumbler Abloy lock or simply disc lock is a high security keyed lock that uses a set of discs similar to those used in a combination lock The difference is that the discs are rotated by a key instead of a dial

When the key is put into the lock it rotates a set of discs with notches on them to different positions depending on the depth of the cuts in the key The right key will line up a set of notches in a straight line allowing a bar to fall into the notches opening the lock The wrong key will not put the notches in a straight line and the bar will not fall preventing the lock from opening On high end disc detainer locks there are usually false notches on the disc as well These feel like the real notch to someone trying to pick the lock but do not allow the bar to fall This makes it nearly impossible to pick the lock It is possible to pick some lower end disc detainer locks

Ecological succession is the process by which a specific ecology has more or less orderly and predictable changes after disturbance like a fire In long term studies there is a species succession process in the way forests develop 

Several scientists are prominent in the history of this process theory

Succession is the act or a process which follows an order or sequence The term may be used in a historical way such as in the traditional order of succession which looks backward to a list of former leaders  like a list of popes or a list of emperors of Japan

Burrel is a small town in Albania It is 91 km from Tirana Its population is about 18000 It is about 320 metres above sea level and surrounded by mountains

The area was settled about the 8th century BC by the Illyrians There have been 54 Illyrian burial mounds found around Burrel The town of Burrel began in 1922 as the centre of the Mat District

A black powder rocket motor pushes a model rocket using black powder Black powder in the rockets is made of charcoal sulphur and potassium nitrate The amount of each part can be changed to change how fast the black powder burns The black powder burns very fast The hot gases move fast as they leave the back of the rocket This pushes the rocket forward 

Black powder rocket motors were made in a simple form by the Chinese They were first written about in the early 13th century The rocket motors have gotten better over the years They have several uses Some can be used as weapons Some have cameras to take pictures from a height to get information Some are also used just for fun 

Black powder rocket motors are only made in small sizes If they are bigger there is a bigger chance of exploding They also do not perform as well if they are bigger They are made in different sizes called classes The classes are 14 A through E If the motor needs to be bigger than this a different type of fuel is used This is called a composite fuel Some examples of composite fuels are ammonium perchlorate or ammonium nitrate 

Black powder is the oldest type of mixed rocket fuel It was used in rockets even before it was used in guns The three main parts of black powder are charcoal sulphur and saltpetre The Chinese were making black powder as early as 1045 which is about 1000 years ago In the early thirteenth century the Chinese turned black powder into a way to power weapons Before that it was only used for fun The first recorded use of rockets as military weapons was in 1232 The Chinese arrows of fire were fired from a sort of catapult The black powder was packed in a closed tube that had a hole in one end for escaping hot gases The tube was mounted on a long stick so it was more balanced 

Black powder had a very low specific impulse The way rockets were made got more advanced but only on paper People had not really built a much better rocket yet They only had ideas and sketches of better models In 1591 a Belgian Jean Beavie wrote about and drew the important idea of rockets that had more than one stage This is called Multistaging This means that the fuel is burned through in more than one step This is the answer to escaping earths gravity and going into space 

By 1600 rockets were being used in some parts of Europe They were used against cavalry which is a group of fighting soldiers on horseback By 1688 rockets weighing over 120 pounds had been built and fired in Germany These German rockets could carry 16 pound warheads

During the late 1700s a London lawyer Sir William Congreve wanted to try to make rockets better He did many experiments with different fuels and cases His experiments were careful and orderly He improved how far rockets could go how stable they were and how accurate they were The British army used Congreves new rockets to help them in the Napoleonic wars 

In 1939 researchers at the California Institute of Technology were trying to make a motor to help launch aircraft They mixed black powder with common road asphalt to make the first composite motor This was the beginning of the composite motor It also ended the use of black powder for big rockets

Black powder rocket propellant is a lot like old fashioned gun powder It has one different part called a binder The binder is usually a substance called Dextrin One common model rocket engine company is Estes Industries Their motors are made with black powder propellant Black powder propellant must be pressed very tightly to work well If it is not packed tightly it will burn too fast and might explode A simple way of combining the parts to make black powder rocket propellant is 75 potassium nitrate 10 sulphur and 15 charcoal This is the most common way of making it Dextrin may be added as a binder Extra charcoal or metal powders may be added to make a spark trail Adding these extras might change how fast the fuel burns

Thrust is how hard of a push the rocket produces Burn time is how long the fuel in the motor takes to burn while pushing gases out of the back of the rocket The impulse of a rocket motor is the area under the thrust time curve This means the impulse is a number for how much force the rocket makes and for how long The impulse of a black powder motor is used to tell what size class it is in Motors are divided into classes from 14A to E These classes hold rockets with impulses from 0 to 40 Ns Other kinds of model rocket motors can be named up to an H which is up to 320 Ns 

Figures from tests of Estes rocket motors are used in the following examples of rocket motor performance 

For miniature black powder rocket motors the maximum thrust is between 5 and 12 N the total impulse is between 5 and 22 Ns and the burn time is between 25 and 1 second For Estes regular size rocket motors there are three classes A B and C The A class 18 mm motors have a maximum thrust between 95 and 975 N a total impulse between 21 and 23 Ns and a burn time between 5 and 75 seconds The B class 18 mm motors have a maximum thrust between 1215 and 1275 N a total impulse between 42 and 435 Ns and a burn time between 85 and 1 second The C class 18mm motors have a maximum thrust from 14 1415 N a total impulse between 88 and 9 Ns and a burn time between 185 and 2 seconds 

There are also 3 classes included in Estes large rocket motors C D and E The C class 24 mm motors have a maximum thrust between 216 and 2175 N a total impulse of between 88 and 9 Ns and a burn time between 8 and 85 seconds The D class 24 mm motors have a maximum thrust between 297 and 298 N a total impulse between 167 and 1685 Ns and a burn time between 16 and 17 seconds The E class 24 mm motors have a maximum thrust between 194 and 195 N a total impulse between 2845 and 286 Ns and a burn time between 3 and 31 seconds

The Bogan River is an inland river of New South Wales Australia It begins at Goonumbla near Parkes It flows in a north west direction for about convert370mikm0lkonabbron before it joins the Darling River near Bourke The towns of Tottenham Peak Hill and Nyngan are built on the banks of the Bogan River

The first European to see the Bogan River was Charles Sturt in 1828 9 He named it New Year Creek However the Indigenous Australian name Bogan which means birth place of a king was the name that was used The explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell created a painting in 1836 of an Aboriginal man Combo from the Bogan River

A wiggler is an insertion device in a synchrotron It is a series of magnets designed to repeatedly laterally deflect a beam of charged particles inside a storage ring of a synchrotron These deflections release synchrotron radiation Although synchrotrons give off such radiation anyway as magnets work to bend the particles on a circle like path a wiggler release more intense radiation than the bending magnets

A wiggler has a broader spectrum of radiation than an undulator In a wiggler the period and the strength of the magnetic field is not tuned to the frequency of radiation produced by the electrons So every electron in the electron bunch radiates independently This makes a broad radiation spectrum A wiggler can be considered to be series of bending magnets stuck together and its radiation intensity goes up as the number of magnetic poles in the wiggler goes up

Typically the magnets in a wiggler are arranged in a Halbach array The design shown above is usually known as a Halbach wiggler

A gold coin is a coin made entirely of gold Gold has been used since the invention of coins It is used because gold is an easy metal to use and because gold is very valuable So a person could have a small quantity of gold coins but still buy many things Gold is also a very dense metal making gold coins hard to fake Gold is good for storing coins because it does not rust

People have used gold to trade since the Bronze Age However gold coins have only existed since the 6th century BC in Anatolia Gold coins were also used in China

In the Middle Ages gold coins were common because of the Florin and the Guilder two important gold coins

Between 1873 and the early 1900s gold coins were the main way to pay Countries stopped using gold coins in 1933 because of the Great Depression People were collecting and keeping the coins so there were not enough for the economy to work Today many countries make gold coins but they are for collectors

Many people enjoy collecting coins The rarest coins are the most expensive Usually very few of these coins were made or they have mistakes or they are very old Some countries have made very large coins for collectors

When people want to buy gold as a way to store money they can buy gold coins These coins are called Bullion coins These coins are usually very pure and have exact weights for example one troy ounce Many people who buy bullion coins hope they become more expensive in the future so they can be sold

Bournville is a model village on the south side of Birmingham England best known for its connections with the Cadbury family and chocolate including a dark chocolate bar called Bournville It is also a ward within the council constituency of Selly Oak and home to the Bournville Centre for Visual Arts Research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has claimed that it is one of the nicest places to live in Britain

Originally the area that was to become Bournville consisted of a few scattered farmsteads and cottages linked by winding country lanes with the only visual highlight being the Georgian built Bournbrook Hall

The bluebell glades of Stocks Wood were said to be a relic of the Forest of Arden and there are Roman remains nearby

Having taken over their father John Cadburys expanding business in 1861 the Quakers George and Richard Cadbury needed to move their cocoa and chocolate factory from Bridge Street in central Birmingham to a greenfield site to allow for expansion

Cadbury were reliant on the canals for milk delivery and on the railways for cocoa deliveries from the ports of London and Southampton They therefore need a site which was undeveloped and had easy access to both canal and rail The brothers noticed the proposed development of the Birmingham West Suburban Railway which would extend from central Birmingham south along the path of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal into the then green fields of southern Birmingham and the villages of northern Worcestershire

In 1879 they moved their business to Bournbrook Hall convert4mikm to the south of Birmingham The location was chosen as it was regarded as cleaner healthier and more amenable to longer term expansion plans Although rural it was also already serviced by the new Stirchley Street railway station which itself was located right next to the canal

The Cadburys named the area Bournville after the Bourn Brook with ville being French for town this set Bournville apart from the local area Then Cadburys began to develop their factory in the new suburb Loyal and hard working workers were treated with great respect and relatively high wages and good working conditions Cadbury also pioneered pension schemes joint works committees and a full staff medical service

In 1893 George Cadbury bought 120 acres of land close to the works and planned at his own expense a model village which would alleviate the evils of modern more cramped living conditions By 1900 the estate included 313 cottages and houses set on convert330acrekm2 of land and many more similar properties were built in the years leading up to the World War I with smaller developments taking place later on in the 20th century These almost Arts and crafts houses were traditional in design but with large gardens and modern interiors and were designed by the resident architect William Alexander Harvey These designs became a blueprint for many other model village estates around Britain It is also noteworthy that because George Cadbury was a temperance Quaker no public houses have ever been built in Bournville although since the late 1940s there has been a licensed members bar at Rowheath Pavilion

The Cadburys were particularly concerned with the health and fitness of their workforce incorporating park and recreation areas into the Bournville village plans and encouraging swimming walking and indeed all forms of outdoor sports In the early 1920s extensive open lands were purchased at Rowheath and laid to football and hockey pitches together with a grassed running track Rowheath Pavilion was designed and built in accordance with the instructions of George Cadbury and opened in July 1924 At that time it served as the clubhouse and changing rooms for the acres of sports playing fields several bowling greens a fishing lake and an outdoor swimming lido a natural mineral spring forming the source for the lidos healthy waters The Rowheath Pavilion itself which still exists was used for balls and dinners and the whole area was specifically for the benefit of the Cadbury workers and their families with no charges for the use of any of the sporting facilities by Cadbury employees or their families The lido was eventually closed in the 1970s after complaints of noise disturbance were made by residents of the newly built Oak Farm estate coupled with new and stringent health and safety regulations relating to outdoor public swimming facilities Cadburys also built the Bournville indoor swimming baths on Bournville Lane the Valley pool boating lake and the picturesque cricket pitch adjacent to the factory site that was made famous as the picture on boxes of Milk Tray chocolates throughout the 1950s and early 1960s

In 1900 the Bournville Village Trust was set up to formally control the development of the estate independently of George Cadbury or the Cadbury company The trust focused on providing schools hospitals museums public baths and reading rooms As Bournville is a conservation area another job of the Bournville Village Trust is to accept or reject plans for building extension and modification

An almost campus feel evolved with a triangular village green infant and junior schools the School of Art and the Day Continuation School and a host of events such as ftes and Maypole dances The carillon and a Quaker meeting house are also beside the village green

The trust continues to exercise an international influence on housing and town planning generally Now containing 7800 homes on 1000 acres of land with 100 acres of parks and open spaces Bournville remains a popular residential area of Birmingham

Cadbury is still one of Birminghams main employers making all manner of chocolate products

The dark chocolate Bournville Plain is now manufactured in France and sold in the UK

Cadbury also named their brand of malted drinks Bournvita after Bournville

The ward is served by three councillors all of whom are Conservative Bill Evans Nigel Dawkins and Timothy Huxtable

Bournville has adopted a Ward Support Officer with the current holder of the title being Karen Stevens

Auto ethnography is a method of social research whose defining characteristic is that the author links personal experience and autobiography with social political and cultural concepts Its difference from ethnography is the high degree of subjectivity that is introduced to the study and the fact that the perspective of the author shows personal involvement with the subject much more than participant observation invites

From the 1970s onwards auto ethnography has been gaining impact and is being used more and more However it still constitutes an issue of controversy and is sometimes criticized because of its individualistic and subjective nature which is seen as potentially undermining of its scientific credibility That is the authors personal involvement with the events and society heshe describes and analyzes is sometimes considered as something that clouds hisher objectivity It remains however questionable whether auto ethnography should be judged on the same terms as traditional ethnography as one may argue that they have different purposes altogether and that a subjective point of view is advantageous and what auto ethnography has to add to traditional methods

Marchal defines auto ethnography as a form or method of research that involves self observation and reflexive investigation in the context of ethnographic field work and writing In the 1970s it was more simply defined as insider ethnography referring to the fact that the group of study is the ethnographers own

The most significant element that auto ethnography introduces to the study of culture and society is the shift from a depersonalized seen from a vantage point and neutrally distanced narrative to a storyline with which the audience can engage morally aesthetically and intellectually and thus co participate in the events described Especially for ethnographers who use multiple informants auto ethnography introduces an alternative way of writing where the distinction between ethnographer and others is unclear thereby challenging imposed identities and boundaries

However auto ethnographers should avoid some dangerous pitfalls that could undermine the credibility and usefulness of their work Chang identifies the following excessive focus on self in isolation from others overemphasis on narration rather than analysis and cultural interpretation exclusive reliance on personal memory and recalling as a data source negligence of ethical standards regarding others in self narratives and inappropriate application of the label autoethnography

 Consequences  This makes the person an outlaw they have no civil rights and lose their protection from the state They are often victims of abuse and unfair treatment both through this loss of rights but also from everyday citizens

Rites of passage are rituals performed by human beings individually or collectively as a social group that symbolically acknowledge the departure from one phase of life and the arrival into another

All people in every society and culture experience rites of passage but these often happen differently for diverse reasons and at special times depending on what society or culture the person comes from Rites of passage celebrate and protect the person or people who are changing They communicate shared ideas of socially expectable behavior and responsibility and they signify the transformation from one social status place condition time to the next

The French social scientist Arnold van Gennep most famously defined the concept of rites of passage in his book Les rites de passage first published in 1909 Van Gennep studied ethnographic reports from various parts of the world that described rites of passage He concluded that they are universally structured even if the rites of passage themselves differ significantly in character between societies and cultures

Rites of passage are ordered into three phases

By acknowledging the various ways different societies and cultures perform rites of passage we observe cultural diversity Learning about rites of passage cross culturally can help us to understand others and ourselves An awareness of cultural diversity is essential to form an open minded tolerant and accepting view of people who are not from the same society or culture as our own

Totemism is a system of belief regarding the relationship between humans and the rest of the natural world The term totem is derived from an Ojibwe word meaning a relative of mine and first appeared in print in 1791 by a trader James Long It has been recorded across native tribes of America Africa and Australia and has been the subject of much ethnographic research Typically the totems of a kinship group will be animals or plants be represented in sacred objects and will belong exclusively to them 

Totemism was considered a primitive religion by many European thinkers in the early late 19th century such as B Morris and McLennan It was attributed to the supposedly universal ideas of food and incest taboos In 1869 JF McLennan said that there is no race of men that has not come through this primitive stage of speculative belief Early thinkers are associated with the idea of totemism being an expression of ignorance by indigenous clans of the difference between humans and animals and are not often considered in contemporary discussions on totemism 

Emile Durkheim argued in 1915 that totemism was a way of societies thinking and considering groups Durkheim drew his conclusions from work with Aboriginal Australian clans Each clan had its own totem which could be any natural feature such as animals plants or rivers These totems and symbols of them were worshiped and protected as their health was associated with the health of the clan Durkheim concluded that the worship of the totems as symbols of the tribe was therefore the clan self worshiping 

Radcliffe Brown followed Durkheims arguments closely in his early work but argued later in 1951 that totemism was not just the basis for religion and society but also scientific thought as the creation of distinctions between every animal or plant taken as a totem took careful observation and categorisation 

Malinowski went on to propose in 1948 that totems are worshiped and protected because the animals and plants they represent are good to eat This view of totemism sees it as a practical strategy to preserve the natural resources available to various tribes This utilitarian theory has mainly been debunked because the area of North America he was considering was so rich in wildlife that even without totemic food taboos it would have been almost impossible for the Indigenous tribes living there to cause extinction of any species through hunting 

Levi Strauss published Totemism in 1962 In this book he extended Radcliffe Browns later arguments and dismisses any utilitarian or religious claims about totemism He proposes that totemism is a manifestation of humans universal tendency to classify things into similar groups Once a population has established rules such as exogamy it becomes important to keep the clan distinct from other clans However humans themselves do not have distinctive features such as a wolf or a bird Therefore applying the identity of an animal to the clan distinguishes its member from another clan and creates social boundaries

Multinaturalism is the idea that there are many different ways of understanding what nature is It looks at the relations between our natural environment and the organisms that inhabit it from multiple perspectives and in doing so challenges the view that there is only one concept of nature that can exist As it is with many aspects of our world ways of seeing can vary dramatically and there is no single or universally agreed upon concept of nature that is applicable to everyone Instead individual groups histories values and beliefs contribute towards their own construction of nature It is the idea that a persons life experiences upbringing and surroundings all contribute to the way they see the natural world to function

A similarity of the idea can be made with multiculturalism a term that describes a society that is built up from many different beliefs behaviours and values This similarly to multinaturalism is an idea of many different concepts of the same thing

Old time environmentalists would argue that there is one true nature In other words nature is a place that has not been tampered with by humans and remains beautiful harmonious and balanced This idea is said to have been by constructed by 19th and 20th century white males who were influenced by European romanticism homegrown transcendentalism and American individualism

 Examples of multinaturalistic ideas  

The term originally came about after the study of Amazonian ways of thinking Many groups in the Amazon have very different ideas on nature than the ones held commonly in Western thinking For example it is said that they see animals to identify themselves as humans and thus as cultural beings On the other hand an old time environmentalist would see an animal simply as an animal

Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are discrete rather than continuous In contrast to real numbers that varying smoothly discrete mathematics studies objects such as integers graphs and statements in logic These objects do not vary smoothly but have distinct separated values Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in continuous mathematics such as calculus and analysis Discrete objects can often be counted using integers Mathematicians say that this is the branch of mathematics dealing with countable sets However there is no exact universally agreed definition of the term discrete mathematics Many times discrete mathematics is described less by what is included than by what is excluded continuously varying quantities and related notions

The set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be finite or infinite The term finite mathematics is sometimes applied to parts of the field of discrete mathematics that deals with finite sets particularly those areas relevant to business

Research in discrete mathematics increased in the latter half of the twentieth century partly due to the development of digital computers which operate in discrete steps and store data in discrete bits Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems in branches of computer science such as computer algorithms programming languages cryptography automated theorem proving and software development In turn computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real world problems such as in operations research

Although the main objects of study in discrete mathematics are discrete objects analytic methods from continuous mathematics are often employed as well

Russia has been at the modern Olympic Games many times They have been called different nations As the Russian Empire they were first at the 1900 Games They returned again in 1908 and 1912 After theRussian revolution in 1917 and the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922 they were not at the Olympics again until the 1952 Summer Olympics After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 Russia competed as part of the Unified Team in 1992 They returned once again as Russia at the 1994 Winter Olympics

The Soviet Union hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow Russia will host the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi

Russian athletes have won a total of 324 medals at the Summer Olympic Games and another 76 at the Winter Olympic Games Over the most recent eight Games Russias 392 total medals including 141 gold medals are second only to the United States

The Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley California is a synchrotron light source It was built from 1987 to 1993 210 scientists and staff currently work there 

The ALS is a national user facility The ALS makes intense light for scientific and technological research It is one of the worlds brightest sources of ultraviolet and soft x ray beams Each year over 2000 researchers go to the ALS from universities industries and government laboratories around the world ALS is funded by the US Department of Energys Office of Basic Energy Sciences

The ALS has over forty beamlines They do a wide range of science at the same time as each other Any qualified scientist can ask to use the ALS beamlines Proposals are reviewed by others The proposals which most people agree on are allowed to use the ALS The ALS does not charge money to use if the users research is made public 

The Advanced Light Sources current director is Roger Falcone

Physicists in Berkeley California began working on accelerating subatomic particles in the 1920s In 1929 Ernest O Lawrence built the first cyclotron to accelerate subatomic particles During World War II a laboratory there was a part of the Manhattan Project They were given money from the military In 1942 Lawrence hired Arthur Brown Jr to design a new round building to hold Lawrences new 467 m cyclotron That building with expansions is the one which the ALS is in today The laboratory was a part of the United States Atomic Energy Commission until 1977 when it was moved to the US Department of Energy

Physicists kept on improving particle accelerators by increasing their energy The designers wanted higher energy to study smaller building blocks of matter From the start physicists realized that as charged particles spun around they gave off electromagnetic radiation In the early 1950s other scientists started to use this radiation for experiments unrelated to the atom smashing collisions that were the primary goal of the machines Particle accelerators shifted from cyclotrons to synchrotrons where the particles traveled in a circle rather than in a spiral path Construction costs increased as synchrotrons got bigger to the point that many nations joined to build just one very big synchrotron in Europe to conduct atom smashing experiments Other synchrotron labs such as the Lawrence Berkeley Lab did not have enough energy to discover new particles So they switched to using their machines as a source of electromagnetic radiation Instead of tuning the machine to make particles travel faster they learned how to wiggle the particle beam to give off particular frequencies of light In the 1980s and 1990s scientists wanted to redesign synchrotrons to generate brighter light than ever before These designs were called third generation synchrotrons The ALS was the first third generation synchrontron put into operation

When the Advanced Light Source was first proposed in the early 1980s by former Lawrence Berkeley Lab director David Shirley skeptics dubbed it Shirleys Temple and doubted the use of a synchrotron tuned to make soft x rays and ultraviolet light According to former ALS director Daniel Chemla The scientific case for a third generation soft x ray facility such as the ALS had always been fundamentally sound However getting the larger scientific community to believe it was an uphill battle

In the 1987 Reagan administration budget President Ronald Reagan allocated 15 million dollars for the construction of the Advanced Light Source

The polarization of the emitted radiation can be controlled by using permanent magnets to induce different periodic electron trajectories through the undulator If the oscillations are confined to a plane the radiation will be linearly polarized If the oscillation trajectory is helical the radiation will be circularly polarized with the handedness determined by the helix

If the electrons follow the Poisson distribution a partial interference leads to a linear increase in intensity In the free electron laser the intensity increases exponentially with the number of electrons 

Physicists measure an undulators effectiveness in terms of spectral radiance

The first undulator was built by Hans Motz and his coworkers at Stanford in 1953 One of their undulators produced the first ever coherent infrared radiation Their total frequency range was from visible light down to milimeter waves The Russian physicist VL Ginzburg showed that undulators could be made in principle in a 1947 paper

Magnetic flux is the amount of magnetic field passing through a surface The SI unit of magnetic flux is the weber The CGS unit is the maxwell For example it is used by electrical engineers trying to design systems with electromagnets or designing dynamos Physicists designing particle accelerators also calculate it

where the closed line integral is over the boundary of the surface and d is an infinitesimal vector element of that contour 

The magnetic flux is usually measured with a fluxmeter The fluxmeter contains measuring coils and electronics that evaluates the change of voltage in the measuring coils to calculate the magnetic flux

Gausss law for magnetism which is one of the four Maxwells equations states that the total magnetic flux through a closed surface is equal to zero This law is a consequence of the empirical observation that magnetic monopoles have never been found

The EMF is determined in this equation in two ways first as the work per unit charge done against the Lorentz force in moving a test charge around the closed curve and second as the magnetic flux through the open surface 

This equation is the principle behind an electrical generator

where

Note that the flux of E through a closed surface is not always zero this indicates the presence of electric monopoles that is free positive or negative charges

Jahbulon is a word that was used in the past in some rituals of certain parts of Masonry It is also said to be used in Ordo Templi Orientis rituals

The origin and meaning of this word are not completely known Different groups think the word means different things Even Masonic researchers do not all agree to what the word means or where it came from One Masonic scholar says that the word was first used in an early 18th century Royal Arch ritual He said it was the name of an explorer looking for King Solomons Temple Another Masonic scholar thinks it is a name for God in Hebrew The most used Masonic explanation is that it is a word that comes from putting together parts of the name of God in different historic languages 

Writers who are not Masons especially those against Masonry have said that it is a Masonic name for God Some say it is the name of a unique Masonic God Freemasonrys officials have said many times that There is no separate Masonic God They have also said that there is no separate proper name for a deity in any branch of Freemasonry This meaning of the word has caused many religious groups to argue about and condemn Freemasonry In England no ritual with the name has been in official Masonic use since February 1989 Stephen Knights author of The BrotherhoodThe Secret World of the Freemasons says it is a trinity composed of three ancient Middle Eastern Gods Jah God of the Jews Baal God of the Phoenicians and On an Egyptian God

Yugoslavia sent athletes to the Olympic Games for the first time in 1920 Before this several athletes from Croatia Slovenia and Vojvodina were on the Olympic teams of Austria or Hungary when those countries were part of the Empire of Austria Hungary A small team of two athletes been sent from the Serbia to the 1912 Summer Olympics

Yugoslavia has been the name for Olympic teams from three distinct nations

Two of the nations that were at one time part of Yugoslavia started sending their own teams to the Olympics at the 1992 Winter Olympics As of the 2008 Summer Olympics all six former parts of Yugoslavia were sending their own teams to the Games

These tables do not include Yugoslavia teams representing the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia

Sex linkage is a term in genetics It applies to traits caused by alleles on sex chromosomes 

In mammals which have an XXXY system of sex determination the X chromosome has many more genes than the Y chromosome This explains the inheritance of such conditions as colour blindness and haemophilia They are caused by recessive alleles and usually do not show the condition in females This is because those females carrying the mutant are most likely to be heterozygous for the allele However if the mutant allele is carried by a male the condition will develop because his X chromosome has the mutant allele but his Y chromosome has no allele at that locus

A telenovela is a serial drama television program It is popular in Latin American Portuguese and Spanish television programming Telenovelas are different from soap operas Telenovelas have an ending They come to an end after a long run This is usually less than one year The telenovela combines drama with the 19th century feuilleton and the Latin American radionovela They are often used to give cultural messages by adding them into storylines

Because the telenovela is similar to the American soap opera the telenovela is often called a Spanish soap opera in the United States While most English language soap operas have no ending almost all telenovelas run for a limit time They are usually shown five or six days a week and run for an average of 120 episodes

Harold Egbert Camping is an American Christian radio broadcaster He served as president of Family Radio a California based radio station group that broadcasts to more than 150 markets in the United States since 1958 In 2011 he retired from active broadcasting following a stroke but still maintains a role at Family Radio Camping is notable for applying numerology to his interpretations of Bible passages in an attempt to predict dates for the End Times 

His 2011 end times prediction was that on May 21 2011 Jesus Christ would return to Earth the righteous would fly up to heaven and that there would follow five months of fire brimstone and plagues on Earth with millions of people dying each day culminating on October 21 2011 with the end of the world He had previously predicted judgment days on May 21 1988 and September 6 1994

His prediction for May 21 2011 was widely reported in part because of a massive publicity campaign by Family Radio and it prompted responses from both atheist and Christian organizations After May 21 passed without the predicted incidents Camping said he believed that a spiritual judgment had occurred on that date and that the physical Rapture would occur on October 21 2011 simultaneously with the destruction of the universe by God Except for one press appearance on May 23 2011 Camping largely avoided press interviews after May 21 particularly after he suffered a stroke in June October 21 2011 passed without the predicted apocalypse leading the International Business Times to proclaim Camping a false prophet 

Camping was reported to have retired from his position at Family Radio as of October 16 2011 only days before his last predicted date for the end of the world However his daughter later clarified that he had not retired outright but was maintaining a role at the Family Radio while working from home Camping admitted in a private interview that he no longer believed that anybody could know the time of the Rapture or the end of the world in stark contrast to his previously staunch position on the subject

The Santana Formation is a high quality fossil site in Brazil It is in northeastern Brazils Araipe Basin It qualifies as a Lagersttte which means it is one of the best fossil sites with many undisturbed fossils

The strata come from the Lower Cretaceous laid down about 92 million years ago in a shallow inland sea

Some 25 species of fish are found many with stomach contents preserved This lets palaeontologists study predatorprey relationships in the ecosystem There are also fine examples of pterosaurs reptiles amphibians invertebrates and plants Even dinosaurs are found here a new maniraptor was described in 1996

Limestone nodules formed around dead organisms this preserved even the soft parts of their anatomy The limestone was etched away using a mild acid The fossils were then preserved by the transfer technique which means they were embedded in a plastic resin such as polyester or epoxy

The nearby Crato Formation is also a lagersttte It was produced in similar conditions about 10 million years before the Santana Formation

Various remains of non avian theropods avialans ornithischians and possibly oviraptorosaurs have been found in Estado do Ceara Brazil Examples are spinosaurs like Irritator and maniraptors like Santanaraptor

The pterosaurs are all pterodactyls because the long tailed rhamphorhynchoidea died out at the JurassicCretaceous junction Ornithocheirus and Tupuxuara are examples The inland sea also had turtles such as Santanachelys

Jits reign started in 686 and ended in 697

In the history of Japan Jit was the third of eight women to be empress The two female monarchs before Jit were Suiko and KgyokuSaimei The five women monarchs after Jit were Gemmei Gensh KkenShtoku Meish and Go Sakuramachi

Before she became the monarch this princesss personal name was or alternately Uno

Princess Uno was the daughter of Emperor Tenji and she was the wife of Emperor Temmu who was Tenjis brother

In this period the court and the government was centered at Fujiwara Palace in Yamato

The actual site of Jits grave is known This empress is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine at Nara

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Jits mausoleum It is formally named Ochi no Okanoe no misasagi

The Manysh includes a poem said to have been composed by Jit

This 14th century sovereign was named after the 10th century Emperor Murakami and go translates literally as later and thus he is sometimes called the Later Emperor Murakami The Japanese word go has also been translated to mean the second one and in some older sources this emperor may be identified as Murakami the second or as Murakami II

His personal name was also known as Yoshiyoshi 

He reigned from Sumiyoshi saka Yoshino Nara and other temporary locations 

Prince Noriyoshi was a member of the Southern Court during the Nanboku ch period of rival courts  

According to the Imperial Household Agency the mausoleum of Go Murakami is in Osaka Prefecture The emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine in the precincts of Kanshinji temple in Kawachinagano Osaka

The years of Go Murakamis reign are more identified by more than one era name

Almayers Folly published in 1895 is Joseph Conrads first novel Set in the late 19th century it centers on the life of the Dutch trader Kaspar Almayer in the Borneo jungle and his relationship to his half caste daughter Nina

Kaspar Almayer is a young Dutch trader cared for by rich Captain Lingard Hoping to gain Lingards wealth Almayer agrees to a loveless marriage to Lingards adopted Malay child and to running his trading post in Sambir in the Borneo jungle Lingard loses much of his fortune searching for a hidden treasure Meanwhile Almayers ventures constantly fail most notably an expensive trading house the Almayers Folly that no one trades in

A daughter named Nina was born to Almayer and his wife The rest of the novel concerns Almayers conflicting wishes his love for Nina his effort at keeping her from her mothers Malay influence and his desire for money and self redemption

Dain a Malay prince arrives at Sambir Almayer tries to enlist Dains help to find the treasure long sought by Lingard Instead Dain marries Nina and leaves Sambir with her against Almayers wishes The loss of Nina and any prospect of wealth stuns Almayer He spends the rest of his days in the empty trading house as his sanity slips away

As Conrads earliest novel Almayers Folly is often seen by critics as inferior to the authors later work because of its repetitive and at times awkward language However recent critics have paid more attention to Conrads depiction of Nina as a self determined female non European character along with Aissa from Joseph Conrads second novel An Outcast of the Islands

Filming started in November 2010 for a French Belgian adaptation by Chantal Akerman

In mathematics a surface integral is a definite integral taken over a surface Just as a line integral handles one dimension or one variable a surface integral can be thought of being double integral along two dimensions Given a surface one may integrate over its scalar fields and vector fields 

Surface integrals have applications in physics particularly with the classical theory of electromagnetism 

which is the formula used for the surface area of a general functional shape One can recognize the vector in the second line above as the normal vector to the surface

Note that because of the presence of the cross product the above formulas only work for surfaces embedded in three dimensional space

 Surface integrals of vector fields 

Consider a vector field v on S that is for each x in S v is a vector

The surface integral can be defined component wise according to the definition of the surface integral of a scalar field the result is a vector For example this applies to the electric field at some fixed point due to an electrically charged surface or the gravity at some fixed point due to a sheet of material It can also calculate the maagnetic flux through a surface

Alternatively mathematicians can integrate the normal component of the vector field the result is a scalar An example is a fluid flowing through S such that v determines the velocity of the fluid at x The flux is defined as the quantity of fluid flowing through S in a unit amount of time 

The cross product on the right hand side of this expression is a surface normal determined by the parametrization

This formula defines the integral on the left

Various useful results for surface integrals can be derived using differential geometry and vector calculus such as the divergence theorem and its generalization Stokes theorem

The discussion above defined the surface integral by using a parametrization of the surface S A given surface might have several parametrizations For example when the locations of the North Pole and South Pole are moved on a sphere the latitude and longitude change for all the points on the sphere A natural question is then whether the definition of the surface integral depends on the chosen parametrization For integrals of scalar fields the answer to this question is simple the value of the surface integral will be the same no matter what parametrization one uses

Integrals of vector fields are more complicated because the surface normal is involved Mathematicians have proved that given two parametrizations of the same surface whose surface normals point in the same direction both parametrizations give the same value for the surface integral If however the normals for these parametrizations point in opposite directions the value of the surface integral obtained using one parametrization is the negative of the one obtained via the other parametrization It follows that given a surface we do not need to stick to any unique parametrization but when integrating vector fields we do need to decide in advance which direction the normal will point to and then choose any parametrization consistent with that direction 

Another issue is that sometimes surfaces do not have parametrizations which cover the whole surface this is true for example for the surface of a cylinder The obvious solution is then to split that surface in several pieces calculate the surface integral on each piece and then add them all up This is indeed how things work but when integrating vector fields one needs to again be careful how to choose the normal pointing vector for each piece of the surface so that when the pieces are put back together the results are consistent For the cylinder this means that if we decide that for the side region the normal will point out of the body then for the top and bottom circular parts the normal must point out of the body too 

Last there are surfaces which do not have a surface normal at each point with consistent results If such a surface is split into pieces on each piece a parametrization and corresponding surface normal is chosen and the pieces are put back together the normal vectors coming from different pieces cannot be reconciled This means that at some junction between two pieces will have normal vectors pointing in opposite directions Such a surface is called non orientable Vector fields can not be integrated on non orientable surfaces

Narrandera is a town in southern New South Wales Australia It is near the junction of the Newell and Sturt Highways on the banks of the Murrumbidgee River In 2006 there were 3961 people living in Narrandera 

Narrandera is a river town with a long history Captain Charles Sturt the famous explorer was the first European to see the area that later became known as Narrandera However Sturt who passed through on 12 December 1829 was not the first explorer to see the Murrumbidgee River The upper Murrumbidgee the Big Water was first discovered in April 1821 by Charles Throsby The name Narrandera probably comes from Wiradjuri word nharrang meaning frill necked lizard

The Narrungderra were the local indigenous people They were all but destroyed by settlement disease brought by European settlers and clashes with the settlers The last major battle between the indigenous people and European settlers took place near Massacre Island and is said to have left only one survivor

Narrandera is first recorded as a pastoral station or run in 1848 The property was owned by Mr Edward Flood covered about convert76800acresha0 

The township developed in the early 1860s Gillinbah Post Office opened nearby on 1 March 1859 and was replaced by the Narrandera office in 1861 A Gillenbah office was open from 1881 to 1892 and from 1906 to 1941

The Borough of Narrandera began on 17 March 1885 The centenary of Local Government in Narrandera was celebrated in 1985

The town of Narrandera is at the centre of a productive farming region Its attractive tree lined streets contrast with the open plains that surround it

The Narrandera Memorial Gardens include the unusual Hankinson Fountain Manufactured by the Royal Doulton Company of England the ceramic fountain is one of only two known in the world the other in India It was given to the people of Narrandera by Alderman and Mrs Hankinson in 1922 in honour of locals who served in World War I The Hankinson Fountain was smashed by an act of vandalism in 1971 and was restored by Charles Pearce

To the east of Narrandera farmers grow cereal crops sheep and wool To the west is the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area fed by water from the Burrinjuck Dam The MIA is a region where farmer grow rice and other cereals with irrigation as well as citrus wine grapes and potatoes 

The town also has number of historic attractions such as a fig tree on the corner of King and Cadell Streets which is thought to be 150 years old and the Mon Repos a residence built in a Queen Anne style which was built in the 1890s

Narranderas Irrigation Canal which carries water to the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area flows through the town It begins convert34kmmi west at Berembed Weir where water is taken from the Murrumbidgee River The canal follows the natural bed of Bundidgerry Creek and in places is very wide and has no levee banks Lake Talbot was formed in 1924 when the bank of the Irrigation Canal gave way flooding the river flat between the canal and Bundidgerry Hill The shallow lake was allowed to remain and became an important recreational feature of the town The eastern end of the lake is used by water skiiers The western end is a wetland habitat for native fauna A wetland has been made near Lizard Drive only convert300mft from the Murrumbidgee River The Narrandera Wetland is a collection point for storm water run off from the town

Narrandera is well served for transport The Sturt Highway and the Newell Highways cross just south of Narrandera Interstate buses pass daily  note that the destination can be listed as Jillenbah The Narranderra Leeton airport is 5 km west of town Regional Express operate several turboprop return services daily to Sydney an hour and 10 minutes flying time away Narranderas railway station is serviced by the weekly Sydney to Griffith XPlorer It stops on the way to Griffith at 233pm on Saturdays and stops on the way back to Sydney at 845am on Sundays CountryLink buses carry passengers daily to and from Wagga to meet Sydney and Melbourne bound train services

FileUN Human Development Report 2011svgthumbright400pxWorld map indicating the Human Development Index 

This is a list of all countries by Human Development Index as included in a United Nations Development Programmes Human Development Report released on 2 November 2011 put together based on estimates for 2011 It covers 185 member states of the United Nations along with Hong Kong and the Palestinian territories 8 UN member states are not included because there is not enough data The average HDI of regions of the World and groups of countries are also included for comparison

The Human Development Index is a comparative measure of life expectancy literacy education and standards of living for countries worldwide It is a standard way of measuring well being especially child welfare It is used to distinguish whether the country is a developed a developing or an under developed country and also to measure the effect of economic policies on quality of life The index was developed in 1990 by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq and Indian economist Amartya Sen

Countries fall into four wide human development categories each of which has 47 countries Very High Human Development High Human Development Medium Human Development and Low Human Development

From 2007 to 2010 the first category was referred to as developed countries and the last three are all grouped in developing countries The original high human development category has been split into two as above in the report for 2007

Some older groupings that have been removed were based on the gross domestic product in purchasing power parity per capita and have been replaced by another index based on the gross national income in purchasing power parity per capita

The country with the largest decrease in HDI since 1998 is Zimbabwe falling from 0514 in 1998 to 0140 in 2010 The country with the largest decrease since 2009 is Cape Verde which decreased by 0170

Over half of the worlds population live in countries with medium human development while less than a fifth of the worlds population are in countries that are in the low human development category Countries with high to very high human development account for less than a third of the worlds total population

Electric flux is not affected by charges that are not within the closed surface But the net electric field E in the Gauss Law equation can be affected by charges that lie outside the closed surface Gauss Law is true in all situations but people can only use it to calculate when high degrees of symmetry exist in the electric field Examples include spherical and cylindrical symmetry Otherwise the calculations are too hard to do by hand and must be worked out using a computer

Electrical flux has SI units of volt metres or equivalently newton metres squared per coulomb So the SI base units of electric flux are kgm3s3A1

The Sportclub Hakoah Graz was a Jewish sports and football club from the Styrian capital Graz It was beside Sturm and GAK the third top league team from Graz 

The club was founded on 12 March 1919 to offer the Jewish people of Graz the possibility to do sports The old club Jdischen Turnvereins zu Graz was dissolved in 1917 Jewish officials were against the club The club was highly accepted by the young football players

In 1921 the football section took part in the 2Klasse of the Styrian football championship The first classes of the federal states were the highest because at that time there was no Austrian wide championship The champion of Viennas highest league was considered Austrian champion They played in blue and white jerseys with the Star of David on the breast It was difficult for them to play because they had no ground of their own Due to the antisemitism of that time other clubs often did not allow them to use their grounds In 1923 they leased an own ground

In the 192122 season they reached the first place and were promoted to the 1 Klasse In the 1 Klasse the club was again confronted with antisemitism The Deutscher Sportverein Leoben and Turnverein Leibniz did not want to play against a Jewish club They were disqualified During the years in the first class Hakoah often reached places on top of the table 

In 1935 the club was relegated to the 2 Klasse The reason for this was that some players went to other clubs and some ended their career because antisemitism grew at that time The club also lost its ground which was only leased The contract was not prolonged In the Second Class they gained again strength but the occupation of Austria by Nazi Germany ended its history The club was dissolved like all other Jewish sports clubs in Austria

Ray Charles Leonard more well known as Sugar Ray Leonard is a former American boxer He was born in Rocky Mount North Carolina Leonard is believed by many to be one of the best boxers of all times He was named the Boxer of the Decade for the 1980s Leonard retired with a record of 36 wins 3 losses and 1 draw He also won the gold medal in the 1976 Olympics 

His mother named him after singer Ray Charles 

Gastroliths or gizzard stones are small rocks kept by an animal inside its stomach or at an early part of the alimentary canal The function of these is to mash up the food so digestion takes place faster Typically animals which do this do not have suitable teeth for grinding and the gastroliths are a good substitute for this 

A second function in aquatic animals is that gastroliths can be used for ballast to make diving easier

Several pieces of evidence are needed to show that a rock was used by a fossil animal to aid its digestion First the stone must be unlike the rock found in its geological vicinity Secondly it should be rounded and polished because inside a gizzard any genuine gastrolith would grind against other stones and fibrous materials like the action of a rock tumbler Lastly the stone must be found with the fossils of the animal which ingested it

A scute is a bony external plate or scale as on the shell of a turtle the skin of crocodiles or the feet of some birds

Scutes are similar to scales and serve the same function Unlike the scales of fish and snakes which are formed from the epidermis scutes are formed in the lower vascular layer of the skin and the epidermal element is only the top surface Forming in the living dermis the scutes produce a horny outer layer that is superficially similar to that of scales 

The dermal base may contain bone and produce dermal armour Scutes with a bony base are properly called osteoderms Dermal scutes are also found in the feet of birds and tails of some mammals and are believed to be the primitive form of dermal armour in reptiles

The term is also used to describe the heavy armour of the armadillo and the extinct glyptodon and is occasionally used as an alternative to scales in describing snakes or certain fish such as sturgeon

An H field is a way of thinking about magnetic fields

Physicists can say that the force and torques between two magnets are caused by magnetic poles repelling or attracting each other This is like the Coulomb force repelling the same electric charges or attracting opposite electric charges In this model a magnetic H field is produced by magnetic charges that are smeared around each pole So the H field is like the electric field E which starts at a positive electric charge and ends at a negative electric charge Near the north pole all H field lines point away from the north pole while near the south pole all H field lines point toward the south pole A north pole then feels a force in the direction of the H field while the force on the south pole is opposite to the H field

In the magnetic pole model the elementary magnetic dipole m is formed by two opposite magnetic poles of pole strength qm separated by a very small distance d such that m qm d 

Unfortunately magnetic poles cannot exist apart from each other All magnets have northsouth pairs which cannot be separated without creating two magnets each having a northsouth pair Also magnetic poles do not account for magnetism that is produced by electric currents nor the force that a magnetic field applies to moving electric charges

which does not depend on the free currents

where mathH0 is the applied magnetic field due only to the free currents and mathHd is the demagnetizing field due only to the bound currents

The magnetic mathH field therefore re factors the bound current in terms of magnetic charges The mathH field lines loop only around free current and unlike the magnetic mathB field begins and ends at near magnetic poles as well

The Nodosauridae is a family of ankylosaur dinosaurs from Upper Jurassic to Upper Cretaceous strata of what are now North America Asia Antarctica and Europe They are the family of ankylosaurs which do not have club shaped tails They often have spikes protecting their head and shoulders

All nodosaurs like other ankylosaurs are medium sized to large heavily built quadrupedal herbivorous dinosaurs with small denticulate teeth and rows of osteoderms on the dorsolateral surfaces of the body

The following taxonomy follows Thompson et al 2011 unless otherwise noted

The clade Nodosauridae may be defined as all ankylosaurs closer to Panoplosaurus than to Ankylosaurus Vickaryous et al considered the most primitive member of the Nodosauridae to be Cedarpelta A cladogram from a 2011 analysis is shown by Richard S Thompson and colleagues

In physics an insertion device is a group of magnets that can be placed on a straight segment of a particle accelerator to be a synchrotron light source They are called an insertion devices because they replace pipe that otherwise would hold the vacuum needed to maintain the particle beam path Many times insertion devices are used on the circular path of a synchrotron or a storage ring

There are two types of insertion devices Undulators make electromagnetic radiation that is tuned to a narrow frequency range Wigglers make a wide range of electromagnetic radiation frequencies

In particle physics a beamline is the path in a particle accelerator of the particles

In materials science physics chemistry and molecular biology a beamline leads to the experimental endstation utilizing particle beams from a particle accelerator synchrotron light obtained from a synchrotron or neutrons from a spallation source or research reactor

In particle accelerators the beamline is usually housed in a tunnel andor underground cased inside a cement housing The beamline is usually cylindrical metal Typical names include beam pipe andor a blank section called a drift tube This entire section must be under a good vacuum in order to have a the beam travel for a long distance

A survey and alignment crew carefully align the beamline segments by using a laser tracker All beamlines must be within micrometre tolerance Good alignment helps to prevent beam loss and beam from colliding with the pipe walls which creates secondary emissions andor radiation

Regarding synchrotrons a beamline is the instrumentation that carries beams of synchrotron radiation to an experimental end station which uses the radiation produced by the bending magnets and insertion devices in the storage ring of a synchrotron light source A typical application for this kind of beamline is crystallography Scientists also use synchrotron light in many other ways

A large synchrotron laboratory will have many beamlines each optimized for a particular field of research The differences will depend on the type of insertion device the beam conditioning equipment and the experimental end station A typical beamline at a modern synchrotron will be 25 to 100 m long from the storage ring to the end station and may cost up to millions of US dollars For this reason a synchrotron facility is often built in stages with the first few beamlines at the start of operation and other beamlines being added later as the funding permits

The beamline elements are located in radiation shielding enclosures called hutches which are the size of a small room A typical beamline consists of two hutches an optical hutch for the beam conditioning elements and an experimental hutch which houses the experiment Between hutches the beam travels in a transport tube People are not allowed to enter hutches when the beam shutter is open and radiation can enter the hutch Hutches have complex safety systems with redundant interlocking functions to make sure that no one is inside the hutch when the radiation is turned on The safety system will also shut down the radiation beam if the door to the hutch is accidentally opened when the beam is on In this case the beam is turned off by dumping the electron beam circulating in the synchrotron So opening one door will shut down all of the beamlines in the facility

Experimenters use the following elements that are used in beamlines for conditioning the radiation beam between the storage ring and the end station

The combination of beam conditioning devices controls the thermal load at the end station the spectrum of radiation incident at the end station and the focus or collimation of the beam Devices along the beamline which absorb significant power from the beam may need to be actively cooled by water or liquid nitrogen The entire length of a beamline is normally kept under ultra high vacuum conditions

An experimental end station in a neutron facility is called a neutron beamline Superficially neutron beamlines differ from synchrotron radiation beamlines mostly by the fact that they use neutrons from a research reactor or a spallation source instead of photons The experiments usually measure neutron scattering from the sample under study

Fred Burton is STATFORs vice president for intelligence STRATFOR is a global intelligence company Burton is thought to be one of the worlds foremost experts on security terrorists and terrorist organizations This basically means that he is thought to be one of the worlds best intelligence workers

He was a special agent with the US Diplomatic Security Service

Washington asked Burton to help the investigation of the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin He used to be the deputy chief of the counter terrorism part of the US State Departments Diplomatic Security Service He also investigated the killing of Rabbi Meir Kahane the al Qaeda New York City bombing plots before the September 11 attacks and the Libyan backed terrorist attacks against diplomats in Sanaa and Khartoum He helped in the arrest of Ramzi Yousef the mastermind of the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993

Burton is the author of a memoir called Ghost Confessions of a Counterterrorism Agent It was published by Random House in 2008 Another memoir is Chasing Shadows A Special Agents Lifelong Hunt to Bring a Cold War Assassin to Justice published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2011

Burton was moved to the Texas Border Security Council on September 11 2007 by Governor Rick Perry

In August 2009 he was hired as the Texas Department of Public Safetys Assistant Director for Intelligence and Counter Terrorism but left after 2 months This was because he wanted to work on his writing and speaking career

Collimated light is light whose rays are parallel and therefore will spread slowly as it propagates The word is related to collinear with all rays lining up In theory collimated light does not disperse with distance Really collimated light will disperse a little as it travels over distance Diffraction prevents scientists from creating a perfectly collimated beam with no divergence Light can be approximately collimated by a number of processes for instance by using a collimator Some people say that collimated light is focused at infinity So as the distance from a point source of light increases the spherical wavefronts become flatter and closer to plane waves which are perfectly collimated

The word collimate comes from the Latin verb collimare which originated in a misreading of collineare to direct in a straight line

Laser light from gas or crystal lasers is highly collimated because it is formed in an optical cavity between two parallel mirrors in addition to being coherent The divergence of high quality laser beams is commonly less than 1 milliradian and can be much less for large diameter beams Laser diodes emit less collimated light due to their short cavity and therefore higher collimation requires a collimating lens

Synchrotron light is very collimated It is produced by bending relativistic electrons around a circular track

The light from stars can be considered collimated for almost any purpose because they are so far away they have almost no angular size

A perfect parabolic mirror will bring parallel rays to a focus at a single point Conversely a point source at the focus of a parabolic mirror will produce a beam of collimated light Since the source needs to be small such an optical system cannot produce much optical power Spherical mirrors are easier to make than parabolic mirrors and they are often used to produce approximately collimated light Many types of lenses can also produce collimated light from point like sources

Collimation refers to all the optical elements in an instrument being on their designed optical axis It also refers to the process of adjusting an optical instrument so that all its elements are on that designed axes With telescopes the term refers to the fact that the optical axes of each optical component should all be centered and parallel so that collimated light emerges from the eyepiece Most amateur reflector telescopes need to be re collimated every few years to maintain optimum performance It is done by simple visual methods such as looking down the optical assembly with no eyepiece to make sure the components are lined up or with the assistance of a simple laser collimator or autocollimator Collimation can also be tested using a shearing interferometer which is often used to test laser collimation 

Decollimation is any mechanism or process which causes a beam with the minimum possible ray divergence to diverge or converge from parallelism Decollimation may be deliberate for systems reasons or may be caused by many factors such as refractive index differences occlusions scattering deflection diffraction reflection and refraction Engineers watch for decollimation in many systems such as radio radar sonar and optical communications

Hispanic is a word that originally meant a relationship to Hispania which is the Iberian Peninsula and includes Portugal Andorra Gibraltar and Spain Now the word is used with a more limited meaning In the United States it is used to mean a person of mixed race with a Spanish surname In North America the word Hispanic has lost its link to Spain and Portugal is mainly used to mean Latin America 

Hispanic has also been used to mean the culture and people of the former Spanish and Portuguese Empires in America Known as Hispanic America this region includes Mexico most of the Central and South American countries and the Spanish speaking island nations of the Caribbean

Spanish names the Spanish language and Spanish customs can also be found in other areas that were part of the Spanish and Portuguese Empires such as in Equatorial Guinea in Africa or in the Spanish East Indies and the Portuguese Brazil

Muryeong of Baekje also known as Sama was a sixth century Korean king  He was the 25th king of Baekje which was one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea in ancient times The name Muryong means military peace It is a posthumous title

During Muryeongs reign the southwestern kingdom of Baekje was allied with its eastern rival Silla against the northern kingdom of Goguryeo 

The king is known for expanding contacts with China and Japan

Muryeongs tomb is located in Gongju in South Chungcheong Province It has been studied by archeologists and historians This the only ancient tomb that has been positively identified among those of this period

In 2001 Japans Emperor Akihito acknowledged a distant relationship with Muryeong He explained I on my part feel a certain kinship with Korea given the fact that it is recorded in the Chronicles of Japan that the mother of Emperor Kammu was of the line of King Muryong of Baekje 

The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 is an Act of Congress about pay discrimination that was signed into law by President Barack Obama on January 29 2009

The bill amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 stating that the 180 day statute of limitations for filing an equal pay lawsuit regarding pay discrimination resets with each new discriminatory paycheck The law was a direct answer to the Ledbetter v Goodyear Tire Rubber Co ussc5506182007 a US Supreme Court decision holding that the statute of limitations for presenting an equal pay lawsuit begins on the date that the employer makes the initial discriminatory wage decision not at the date of the most recent paycheck as a lower court had ruled

A first bill to amend the statutory limitations period and supersede the Ledbetter decision was introduced in the 110th United States Congress but was never enacted as after having been passed by the House it failed to survive a cloture vote in the Senate due to the opposition of most of the Republican Senators 

During the campaign for the 2008 elections the Democrats criticized Republicans for defeating the 2007 version of the bill citing Republican presidential candidate John McCains opposition Then candidate Barack Obama supported the bill

After the 2008 election gave the Democratic Party control of both the House and Senate a new version of the bill was introduced in the first session of the 111th United States Congress and quickly passed both bodies It became the law signed by the new President Obama after he took office on January 20

Lilly Ledbetter a production supervisor at a Goodyear tire plant in Alabama filed an equal pay lawsuit seeking back pay for pay discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 She worked for that company for many years without learning that she was paid much less than the men holding the same job She filed the lawsuit six months before her early retirement in 1998 The District court said her lawsuit was filed on time but the Court of Appeals said her lawsuit was too late Ledbetter appealed the decision to the United States Supreme Court The Supreme Court ruled in 2007 by a 5 4 majority vote that Ledbetters complaint was filed too late because the discriminatory decisions relating to pay had been made more than 180 days prior to the date she filed her charge as explained by Justice Samuel Alito The minority position explained by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg proposed an interpretation according to which the law runs from the date of any paycheck that contains an amount affected by a prior discriminatory pay decision

The Ledbetter decision was cited by federal judges in 300 cases before the LLFPA was passed These cases involved not only Title VII of the Civil Rights Act but also the Age Discrimination in Employment Act Fair Housing Act Patsy T Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act and Eighth Amendment to the Constitution

The case had never received much attention before going to the Supreme Court but the Courts ruling ignited legal groups on the left and Democrats that took action to transform the Ledbetter case into a rallying issue for the left Some activists saw Lilly Ledbetter as an ideal standard bearer in their attempt to persuade the public that the Supreme Court was moving too far to the right 

Among the first to criticize the Courts decision was Marcia Greenberger president of the National Womens Law Center that saw in the ruling a setback for women and a setback for civil rights and called Ginsburgs opinion a clarion call to the American people that this slim majority of the court is headed in the wrong direction Debra Ness president of the National Partnership for Women Families also condemned the decision saying If employers can keep the discrimination hidden for a period of time they can continue to discriminate without being held accountable On the other side the majoritys findings were applauded by the US Chamber of Commerce that called it a fair decision that eliminates a potential wind fall against employers by employees trying to dredge up stale pay claims

The House Democrats were fast to react On June 12 the caucus spoke against the Supreme Court decision Claiming lead from Justice Ruth Ginsburgs minority opinion which invited the Congress to take action by amending the law the Democrats announced their intention to intervene House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller said that a bill was to be passed to avoid future court rulings in line with Ledbetter clearly putting that a key provision of the legislation will make it clear that discrimination occurs not just when the decision to discriminate is made but also when someone becomes subject to that discriminatory decision and when they are affected by that discriminatory decision including each time they are issued a discriminatory paycheck as said by Rep Miller

Republicans immediately opposed the bill as drafted with Education and Labor Committee ranking member Howard McKeon raising the issue that companies would be held liable for actions taken by managers who werent leading the company anymore At the end of the day such a loophole conceivably could allow a retiring employee to seek damages against a company now led by executives who had nothing to do with the initial act of discrimination

The issue divided lawyers The American Bar Association passed a resolution supporting the new bill Other lawyers such as Neal Mollen argued that extending the term limit would put a strain on the chances of an adequate defense for the employers as to defend themselves one has to rely on documents and the memory of individuals and neither of those is permanent If a disappointed employee can wait for many years before raising a claim of discrimination he or she can wait out the employer that is ensure that the employer effectively unable to offer any meaningful defense to the claim

Organizations that supported the bill included the American Civil Liberties Union AFL CIO American Federation of Teachers National Education Association American Rights at Work American Library Association People For the American Way Leadership Conference on Civil Rights National Employment Lawyers Association Hadassah National Womens Law Center National Network to End Domestic Violence Center for Inquiry  Washington DC American Association of University Women Alliance for Justice Legal Momentum Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law National Partnership for Women and Families Coalition of Labor Union Women Moms Rising National Organization for Women American Association of Retired Persons Womens Voices Women Vote Action Fund 21st Century Democrats 9to5 National Association of Working Women the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism and Women Employed

Organizations that opposed the bill include the US Chamber of Commerce Eagle Forum Society for Human Resource Management National Association of Manufacturers American Bakers Association College and University Professional Association for Human Resources Associated Builders and Contractors and American Housing Lodging Association

The bill was defeated in April 2008 by Republicans in the Senate who cited the possibility of frivolous lawsuits in their opposition of the bill and criticized Democrats for refusing to allow compromises

The bill was re introduced in the 111th Congress in January 2009 It passed in the House of Representatives with 247 votes in support and 171 against The vote was nearly perfectly split along party lines with only three Republicans voting in favor and three Democrats voting nay The Senate voted 72 to 23 to invoke cloture on S 181 on January 15 2009 The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act passed the Senate 61 36 on January 22 2009 The votes in favor included every Democratic senator and five Republican senators 

As president Obama actively supported the bill The official White House blog said President Obama has long championed this bill and Lilly Ledbetters cause and by signing it into law he will ensure that women like Ms Ledbetter and other victims of pay discrimination can effectively challenge unequal pay

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced that the House would vote on S181 during the week of January 26 getting the bill to President Obamas desk sooner rather than later On January 27 the House passed S181 by a 250 177 margin 

On January 29 Obama signed the bill into law It was the first act he signed as president and it fulfilled his campaign pledge to nullify Ledbetter v Goodyear However some newspapers criticised him for signing it only two days after it was passed by the House The St Petersburg Times which mentioned his campaign promise to give the public five days of notice to comment on legislation before he signed bills The White House through a spokesman answered that they would be implementing this policy in full soon and that currently they were working through implementation procedures and some initial issues with the congressional calendar

Arena rock is a word to describe a form of rock music which is played or intended to be played in large venues such as stadia and open air concert spaces In such a way genres which traditionally fall within the categories of arena rock tend to be loud and anthemic arena rock is most traditionally associated with heavy metal progressive rock hard rock glam metal or pop rock genres Often yet not always arena rock is categorised as being more mass scale commercially appealing and radio oriented music Due to the often commercial nature of arena rock it is occasionally called corporate rock

Arena rock is generally associated with the grand shows that artists and groups within the style would hold At these performances large sound systems and often elaborate lighting additional effects and fireworks would be included The 1970s and 80s were a major period in arena rock

Whilst arena rock has seen large popularity over the years especially from the 1960s to the 1980s it has also been criticised for its often commercial and extravagant nature especially with regards to the shows and concert tours that arena rock bands and artists would have To some extent genres such as pub rock punk rock indie rock and alternative rock grew as a reaction against the nature and aesthetic of arena rock opting for a less commercial and over the top style

Famous bands and artists associated with arena rock include Queen Led Zeppelin Aerosmith KISS and Styx amongst several others

Martin Luther King Jr a prominent American leader of the civil rights movement and Nobel Peace Prize laureate was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis Tennessee on April 4 1968 at the age of 39 On June 10 1968 James Earl Ray a fugitive from the Missouri State Penitentiary was arrested in London at Heathrow Airport Ray was extradited to the United States and charged with the crime On March 10 1969 Ray entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced to 99 years in the Tennessee state penitentiary Ray later made many attempts to withdraw his guilty plea and be tried by a jury but was unsuccessful He died in prison on April 23 1998 at the age of 70

Civil disorder following the killing affected at least 110 US cities Washington Chicago and Baltimore had the most damage

The United States House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations was established in 1976 to investigate the assassinations of John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr and the shooting of Governor George Wallace The Committee investigated until 1978 On the King assassination the Committee concluded in its 1979 final report that he was killed by one rifle shot from James Earl Ray that there is a likelihood that this was the result of a conspiracy and that no US government agency was part of this conspiracy probably between Ray and his brothers

In 1999 Coretta Scott King Kings widow along with the rest of Kings family won a wrongful death civil trial against Loyd Jowers and other unknown co conspirators Jowers claimed to have received 100000 to arrange Kings assassination The jury of six whites and six blacks found Jowers liable and that governmental agencies were parties to the assassination plot

In 2000 the Department of Justice completed the investigation about Jowers claims but did not find evidence to support the allegations about conspiracy The investigation report recommends no further investigation unless some new reliable facts are presented

The Lorraine Motel is now a civil rights museum

On 25 December 2011 there were a number of attacks on Christmas during church services in northern Nigeria There were bomb blasts and shootings at churches in Madalla Jos Gadaka and Damaturu At least 39 people were killed The attacks were claimed by the Islamist group Boko Haram

Albert Leo Schlageter was a member of the German Freikorps His activities sabotaging French occupying troops after World War I led to his arrest and eventual execution by French forces His death created an image of martyrdom around him which was cultivated by German nationalist groups in particular the Nazi Party During the Third Reich he was widely commemorated as a national hero

Magnetic reluctance or magnetic resistance is a measurement used in the analysis of magnetic circuits It is like resistance in an electrical circuit but rather than dissipating magnetic energy it stores magnetic energy As an electric field causes an electric current to follow the path of least resistance a magnetic field causes magnetic flux to follow the path of least magnetic reluctance It is a scalar extensive quantity like electrical resistance

Reluctance is usually represented by a curly capital R

The term was coined in May 1888 by Oliver Heaviside The notion of magnetic resistance was first mentioned by James Joule and the term magnetomotive force was first named by Bosanquet The idea for a magnetic flux law similar to Ohms law for closed electric circuits is attributed to H Rowland

The total reluctance is equal to the ratio of the magnetomotive force in a passive magnetic circuit to the magnetic flux in this circuit In an AC field the reluctance is the ratio of the amplitude values for a sinusoidal MMF and magnetic flux

It is sometimes known as Hopkinsons law and is analogous to Ohms Law with resistance replaced by reluctance voltage by MMF and current by magnetic flux 

Magnetic flux always forms a closed loop as described by Maxwells equations but the path of the loop depends on the reluctance of the surrounding materials It is concentrated around the path of least reluctance Air and vacuum have high reluctance Easily magnetized materials such as soft iron have low reluctance The concentration of flux in low reluctance materials forms strong temporary poles and causes mechanical forces that tend to move the materials towards regions of higher flux so it is always an attractive force

Its SI derived unit is the henry

Triglav is a mountain in the Alps It is the highest mountain in Slovenia It is also the highest peak of the Julian Alps in the southeastern part of the Alps 

Its name means three headed in Slovene While this can describe the mountain it is more likely the mountain was named for the Old Slovene god Triglav The mountain is shown on the Flag of Slovenia 

Ampres circuital law discovered by Andr Marie Ampre in 1826 relates the magnetic field around a closed loop to the electric current passing through the loop It is now one of Maxwells equations which form the basis of classical electromagnetism

The law relates magnetic fields to electric currents that produce them A scientist can use Amperes law to determine the magnetic field associated with a given current or current associated with a given magnetic field if there is no time changing electric field present In its original form Ampres Circuital Law relates the magnetic field to its electric current source The law can be written in two forms the integral form and the differential form The forms are equivalent and related by the KelvinStokes theorem It can also be written in terms of either the B or H magnetic fields Again the two forms are equivalent

Ampres circuital law is now known to be a correct law of physics in a magnetostatic situation The system is static except possibly for continuous steady currents within closed loops In all other cases the law is incorrect unless Maxwells correction is included

Second there are infinitely many possible surfaces S that have the curve C as their border Which of those surfaces is to be chosen If the loop does not lie in a single plane for example there is no one obvious choice The answer is that it does not matter it can be proven that any surface with boundary C can be chosen

The electric current that arises in the simplest textbook situations would be classified as free current For example the law can apply to the current that passes through a wire or battery In contrast bound current arises in the context of bulk materials that can be magnetized andor polarized 

When a material is magnetized the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms but behave as if they were orbiting the nucleus in a particular direction creating a microscopic current When the currents from all these atoms are put together they create the same effect as a macroscopic current circulating perpetually around the magnetized object This magnetization current JM is one contribution to bound current 

The other source of bound current is bound charge When an electric field is applied the positive and negative bound charges can separate over atomic distances in polarizable materials and when the bound charges move the polarization changes creating another contribution to the bound current the polarization current JP

with Jf the free or conduction current density

All current is fundamentally the same microscopically There are often practical reasons for wanting to treat bound current differently from free current For example the bound current usually originates over atomic dimensions and one may wish to take advantage of a simpler theory intended for larger dimensions The result is that the more microscopic Ampres law expressed in terms of B and the microscopic current is sometimes put into the equivalent form below in terms of H and the free current only For a detailed definition of free current and bound current and the proof that the two formulations are equivalent see the proof section below

which is non zero for a time varying charge density An example occurs in a capacitor circuit where time varying charge densities exist on the plates

To treat these situations the contribution of displacement current must be added to the current term in Ampres law 

James Clerk Maxwell conceived of displacement current as a polarization current in the dielectric vortex sea which he used to model the magnetic field with water and with mechanical systems He added this displacement current to Ampres circuital law at equation in his 1861 paper On Physical Lines of Force 

In free space the displacement current is related to the time rate of change of electric field

In a dielectric the above contribution to displacement current is also present but a major contribution to the displacement current is related to the polarization of the individual molecules of the dielectric material Even though charges cannot flow freely in a dielectric the charges in molecules can move a little under the influence of an electric field The positive and negative charges in molecules separate under the applied field causing an increase in the state of polarization expressed as the polarization density P A changing state of polarization is equivalent to a current

The first term on the right hand side is present everywhere even in a vacuum It doesnt involve any actual movement of charge but it nevertheless has an associated magnetic field as if it were an actual current Some authors apply the name displacement current to only this contribution

The second term on the right hand side is the displacement current as originally conceived by Maxwell associated with the polarization of the individual molecules of the dielectric material 

Maxwells original explanation for displacement current focused upon the situation that occurs in dielectric media In the modern post aether era the concept has been extended to apply to situations with no material media present for example to the vacuum between the plates of a charging vacuum capacitor The displacement current is justified today because it serves several requirements of an electromagnetic theory correct prediction of magnetic fields in regions where no free current flows prediction of wave propagation of electromagnetic fields and conservation of electric charge in cases where charge density is time varying For greater discussion see Displacement current

Ampres equation was extended by including the polarization current thereby remedying the limited applicability of the original Ampres circuital law

where current density JD is the displacement current and J is the current density contribution actually due to movement of charges both free and bound Because thinspthinspD  the charge continuity issue with Ampres original formulation is no longer a problem Because of the term in 0E t wave propagation in free space now is possible

With the addition of the displacement current Maxwell was able to hypothesize that light was a form of electromagnetic wave See electromagnetic wave equation for a discussion of this important discovery

The United States Air Force Academy is an American military college It was created in 1954 The Acadey is an accredited college for the undergraduate education of people who want to be officers for the United States Air Force The college is north of Colorado Springs in El Paso County The Academys goal is to educate train and inspire men and women to become officers of character motivated to lead the United States Air Force in service to our nation It is the youngest of the five United States service academies The Academy had its first graduation in 1959 Graduates of the Academys four year program get a Bachelor of Science degree Most become second lieutenants in the United States Air Force

The Academy is one of the largest tourist attractions in Colorado More than a million people visit it each year Students are called cadets

The Air Force Academy is one of the most selective colleges in the United States US News and World Report recently ranked it tied for 5th place in the category Undergraduate Engineering Programs Forbes magazine in 2009 ranked the Academy the 2 public college in the United States and the 7 college overall in its Americas Best Colleges 2009 publication People wanting to study at the Academy are judged on their academic achievement leadership athletics and character They must pass a fitness test pass a medical examination and be nominated by the member of Congress where they live Recent classes have had about 1400 cadets Normally under 1000 of the cadets will graduate The cost of going to the Academy Housing and food are paid for by the US government Cadets are paid monthly while at the Academy but they must be a part of the military for a number of years after they graduate

The program at the Academy is based on the Air Forces core values These are Integrity First Service Before Self and Excellence in All We Do They are also based on four pillars of excellence military training academics athletics and character development Cadets study military training and large curriculum in engineering humanities social sciences basic sciences military studies and physical education All cadets take part in athletics The academy has a character development and leadership curriculum

The National Security Act of 1947 started the Air Force within the United States military Secretary of the Air Force W Stuart Symington made an agreement where up to 25 of West Point and Annapolis graduates could ask to become officers in the new Air Force This was only meant to happen for a short time Disagreements between the parts of the military led to the creation of the Service Academy Board It was created by Secretary of Defense James Forrestal In January 1950 the Service Academy Board was controlled by Dwight D Eisenhower He was the president of Columbia University at the time The board said that the two US service academies were not able to train enough officers for the Air Force They decided that an air force academy was needed President Eisenhower signed a law on 1 April 1954 to begin building the Air Force Academy

On 7 October 1975 President Gerald R Ford signed a law that let women study at the United States service academies On 26 June 1976 157 women went to the Air Force Academy On 28 May 1980 97 of them finished the program and graduated from the Academy They made up about 10 of the graduating class Women now make up about 20 of the classes

The first Honor scandal happened in 1965 A cadet who was leaving the Academy said that more than 100 cadets had been part of a cheating ring One hundred and nine cadets had to leave the Academy Cheating scandals were at the Academy again in 1967 1972 1984 2004 and 2007 After each scandal the Academy tried to learn why the cheating took place They also looked at complaints that the academic system put too much pressure on the cadets Changes were made to try to reduce the events from happening again 

In 2005 there were complaints that some Evangelical Christian cadets and staff were trying to convert others to their religion at the Academy Because of this and how the Air Force deals other religious issues Academy graduate Michael L Weinstein filed a lawsuit against the Air Force

A climbing route is a trail that a mountain climber uses to go up a mountain It is often simply called a climb

Examples D1 on The Diamond and The Nose on El Capitan are climbing routes

The difficulties and lengths of climbing routes can be found in books called climbing guides For instance enFifty Classic Climbs of North America is a climbing guide that describes climbing routes of North America

The femoral artery is the large artery that takes oxygen rich blood to a humans legs Coming from the heart the blood flows along the iliac artery which then divides into the two femoral arteries to supply blood to each leg The artery is very close to the surface where it passes through the groin

An enterotype is a classification of living organisms It is based on the ecosystem that is created in the human intestinal system by the bacteria that exists there This is called the human gut microbiome Peer Bork and scientists that worked with him said in the April 2011 issue of Nature that they have found three enterotypes They think that people can be classified into one of three groups based on the bacteria in their intestines The entereotype of each person is set while the person is an infant The enterotype affects how well a person can digest food or absorb drugs

Type 1 has by high levels of Bacteroides Type 2 has few Bacteroides but Prevotella are common Type 3 has high levels of Ruminococcus

Amelia Jessica Amy Pond is a fictional character on the British science fiction television series Doctor Who She is played by Karen Gillan Amy is a companion of the main character the Doctor in his eleventh form Much of Amys part in the story is about her relationship with Rory Williams They get married in the sixth series and Amy gives birth to their daughter Melody It is later shown that Melody grows up to be the character River Song

Amelia Pond is first seen in the first episode of the 2010 series The Eleventh Hour She is a seven year old girl living with only her aunt Sharon She asks the Doctor to look at a strange crack in her wall He is interrupted by the TARDIS The Doctor tells Amelia that he will be back in five minutes He does not get back for twelve years During this time Amelias family and friends think The Doctor is her imaginary friend She is treated by four psychiatrists because she keeps telling people that the Raggedy Doctor is real She bites them when they tell her the Doctor is imaginary When the Doctor returns Amy is nineteen years old She is working as a kissogram Amy helps the Doctor save Earth from the Atraxi Because of the unusual condition of the TARDIS Amy does not see the Doctor again for two years He asks her to travel with him She says she will go with him but only if he will bring her back by the next morning She does not tell him that her wedding is the next day

At the end of Flesh and Stone Amy tells the Doctor about her wedding to Rory Because of pre wedding jitters she tries to seduce him The Doctor then finds Rory and takes him and Amy to 16th century Venice At this point in time Rory travelling with them In Amys Choice Amy has to deal with her feelings for the Doctor and Rory She sees how much she loves Rory At the end of Cold Blood Rory is killed and removed from history by the cracks in the universe Amy no longer remembers him The Doctor takes Amy to her favourite places because he feels guilty about Rory In 19th century France Amy forms a friendship with painter Vincent Van Gogh Van Gogh shows a romantic interest in Amy In The Pandorica Opens Rory is found in 102 AD as a Roman centurion Amy starts to remember himAs she remembers it is shown that the centurion Rory is only an Autonliving plastic that looks and acts like Rory It was made from Amys memories to trap the Doctor Rory tries to fight his programming but fails He shoots and kills Amy Amys body is put in the Pandorica It is a perfect prison It was built to keep any person trapped in it alive forever Auton Rory guards the Pandorica while Amy is inside She is kept inside while her body is healed In 1996 the Pandorica is finally opened and she is set free by the younger Amy Pond 

The Doctor learns that Amy is connected to the cracks in the universe He sees that they come from a temporal explosion on the date of her wedding He talks to Amy about her house He tells her that it is too big for only her and her aunt Amy learns that her family had been erased by the crack in her wall She had forgotten them The Doctor helps her remember them He uses the Pandorica to reset the universe and finds the sleeping Amelia on the night they met He tells her the story of how he borrowed the TARDIS from his own people He tells her that it is old and new and big and small and the bluest blue that there is He then steps into the crack in her wall to closes the cracks forever Amy wakes up on her wedding day and is reunited with her parents She marries Rory At the reception she sees that River Songs diary about time spent with the Doctor is now empty This causes Amy to start remembering things She says that her Raggedy Doctor was real and her memory of him brings him back to reality After this Amy and Rory choose to go with the Doctor again They are dropped off at a honeymoon planet between the end of The Big Bang and the start of Death of the Doctor Part of their honeymoon is on an interstellar cruise ship that the Doctor stops from crashing into a populated planet 

In the 2011 series after an unknown amount of time Amy and Rory return to the present They go back to living a normal life until Amy gets an anonymous TARDIS blue invitation to the Utah desert In the desert she and Rory find the Doctor He has aged almost 200 years since they left the TARDIS They learn that River Song was also invited to this place They group sees the Doctors killed by an astronaut They learn that the older Doctor also invited a younger version of himself They travel with him to 1969 Washington DC to investigate strange things involving the Silence The silence is an alien race who cannot be remembered After a person met one of the silence they would forget everything about them as soon as they could no longer see them While there Amy tells the Doctor she is pregnant She later shoots a person in an astronaut suit trying to save the future Doctors life She sees that the person in the suit is just a little girl When the Doctor asks Amy later about the pregnancy she tells him that she was wrong The Doctor tries to learn more but learns nothing In Day of the Moon Amy finds strange pictures of the astronaut girl in an old orphanage In one of the pictures She is holding a baby She sees the little girl again as well as two Silence Amy is kidnapped by the Silence She is set free by the Doctor Rory and River a few days later 

During the first six episodes Amy keeps having strange visions of a woman in an eye patch The woman keeps saying that she must be dreaming In The Almost People it is shown that the Amy with the Doctor is actually an avatar version It was created with the Flesh brought to life by Amys consciousness The Doctor destroys it and he and Rory go to find the real Amy She is at that time beginning to have her baby Amy gives birth to her daughter Melody Pond In A Good Man Goes to War the baby is kidnapped by the eye patched woman Madame Kovarian Korvarian replaced the baby with a Flesh version It is shown at the end of the episode that the name Melody Pond when translated into an alien language is River Song River is Amy and Rorys daughter Lets Kill Hitler shows how Melody had regenerated into Mels Mels was the childhood friend of Amy and Rory Amy named her daughter after Mels The episode does not show her true identity until she regenerates into River Song after being shot by Hitler The episode also shows how Amy and Rory fell in love In The God Complex the Doctor has to break Amys faith in him He learns that she is the reason they are brought to a prison for a being that kills by feeding on faith The Doctor says goodbye to Rory and Amy after giving them a house and car In Closing Time Amy makes a cameo appearance It is shown that she has become a model and the face of Petrichor perfume 

In The Wedding of River Song Amy leads a secret organisation Rory works for her The Doctor and River meet again in an alternate reality after River stopped the Doctor being killed by the astronaut Amy remembers all of her past with the Doctor but cannot remember Rory Amy finally remembers Rory when she saves him from the Silence She kills Madame Kovarian for taking away Melody Reality is restored when the Doctor and River marry Amy and Rory are back at home They have had no contact with the Doctor since The God Complex but they still remember the alternate events Later River tells Amy that the Doctor did not die in Utah and is in fact alive

In December 2011 the BBCs Steven Moffat confirmed that Amy and Rory would be leaving the series in 2012 in heartbreaking circumstances 

Doctor Who executive producer and main writer Steven Moffat came up with the name for the character In an interview with Kat Angus of Dose magazine Doctor Who writer Russell T Davies said So when the new series starts next year with the new Doctor you dont just get Matt Smith coming on you also get Karen Gillan as his new companion I think Amy Pond will be hugely welcomed because I think he does need someone A lot of these stories prove that Theres been a huge empty space on the TARDIS for a long time now and I think her arrival will be every bit as big as Matts Its really exciting and everything Ive heard about Karen is that shes brilliant Its one of our plans that Im most pleased with actually Weve held off on companions for a long time so youll get rewarded with a great big strong character in Amy Pond when she arrives I think that plans been good Gillan said in an interview with the Radio Times that she was to play Amy Pond with her natural Scottish accent She auditioned for the part in both her natural accent and with an English one Gillan has said that she feels using her Scottish accent better fits the character

Gillan like some of the people who had been the Doctors companion before her had already been on Doctor Who in a smaller role Gillan was a soothsayer in the episode The Fires of Pompeii It was broadcast in 2008

Steven Moffat said of the casting for the character We saw some amazing actresses for this part But when Karen came through the door the game was up  she was funny clever gorgeous and sexy Or Scottish which is the quick way of saying it A generation of little girls will want to be her And a generation of little boys will want them to be her too Doctor Who executive producer Piers Wenger agreed We knew Karen was perfect for the role the moment we saw her She brought an energy and excitement to the part that was just fantastic

Gillan said she was happy to have been cast in the role She says I am absolutely over the moon at being chosen to play the Doctors new companion The show is such a massive phenomenon that I cant quite believe I am going to be a part of it Matt Smith is an incredible actor and it is going to be so much fun to act alongside him I just cant wait to get started The role of the young Amelia was played by Gillans 10 year old cousin Caitlin Blackwood Gillan asked producers to let her cousin play the part but Blackwood still had to audition On set was the first time Gillan and Blackwood had actually met each other

When The Eleventh Hour was first shown two viewers quoted in The Telegraph said that Amys character was too sexy for a family programme like Doctor Who Executive producer Piers Wenger said that Amy was meant to be feisty and outspoken and a bit of a number Amy is probably the wildest companion that the Doctor has travelled with but she isnt promiscuous

In an online poll with 3000 people taken in late 2010 Amy Pond was listed as the fifth most popular companion

Terrazzo is a building material that has the cross section of polished rock chips decorating its appearance It is a composite material made up of chips surrounded by a binder It is poured in place or precast It is used for floors or walls It consists of marble quartz granite glass or other suitable chips sprinkled or unsprinkled and poured with a binder that is cement like chemical or a combination of both Terrazzo is cured ground and polished to a smooth surface Sometimes it is finished to produce a uniformly textured surface that is not flat 

Terrazzo artisans create walkways floors patios and panels by exposing marble chips and other fine aggregates on the surface of finished concrete or epoxy resin Much of the preliminary work of terrazzo workers is similar to that of cement masons Marble chip cementitious terrazzo requires three layers of materials First cement masons or terrazzo workers build a solid level concrete foundation that is 3 to 4 inches deep After the forms are removed from the foundation workers add a 1 inch layer of sandy concrete Before this layer sets terrazzo workers partially embed metal divider strips in the concrete wherever there is to be a joint or change of color in the terrazzo For the final layer terrazzo workers blend and place into each of the panels a fine marble chip mixture that may be color pigmented While the mixture is still wet workers toss additional marble chips of various colors into each panel and roll a lightweight roller over the entire surface

In the 1970s polymer based terrazzo was introduced and is called thin set terrazzo Initially polyester and vinyl ester resins were used as the binder resin Today most of the terrazzo installed is epoxy terrazzo The advantages of this material over cement based terrazzo include a wider selection of colors 14 inch to 38 inch installation thickness lighter weight faster installation impermeable finish higher strength and cracking less The disadvantage of epoxy resin based terrazzo is that it can only be used inside not outside buildings Epoxy based terrazzo will lose its color and slightly peel when used outdoors Cement based terrazzo will not

In addition to marble aggregate blends other aggregates have been used such as mother of pearl and abalone shell Recycled aggregates include glass porcelain concrete and metal Shapes and medallions can be fabricated on site by bending divider strips or off site by water jet cutting

When the terrazzo is thoroughly dry helpers grind it with a terrazzo grinder which is somewhat like a floor polisher only much heavier Slight depressions left by the grinding are filled with a matching grout material and hand troweled for a smooth uniform surface Terrazzo contractors then clean polish and seal the dry surface for a finish that shines

Venetian construction workers invented terrazzo for use as a low cost flooring material using leftover marble chips from upscale jobs The workers would usually set them in clay to surface the patios around their living quarters Consisting originally of marble chips clay and goat milk production of terrazzo became much easier after the 1920s and the introduction of electric industrial grinders and other power equipment

Newly set terrazzo will not look like marble unless it is wet So they used the goats milk to act as a sealer and preserving the wet and marble like look

Archaeologists use the word terrazzo to describe the floors of early neolithic buildings in Western Asia that are constructed of burnt lime and clay colored red with ochre and polished The embedded crushed limestone gives it a slightly mottled appearance The use of fire to produce burnt lime which was also used for the hafting of implements predates the use of pottery by almost a thousand years In the early Neolithic settlement of Cayn in eastern Turkey ca 90 m of terrazzo floors have been uncovered The floors of the PPN B settlement of Nevali Cori measure about 80 m They are 15 cm thick and contain about 10 15 lime

Other sites with terrazzo floors include Nevali Cori Gbekli Tepe Jericho and Kastros

Terrazzo flooring is an original recycled product created centuries ago by Venetian workers using the waste chips from slab marble processing Today Terrazzo continues to provide environmentally friendly durability and low maintenance typically lasting the life of the building With no volatile organic compounds it earns further point on indoor air quality ratings Recycled content is still a standard feature of modern terrazzo 

Terrazzo aggregates binders and finished flooring systems can contribute to US Green Building Council credits under the LEED NC rating system version 22 

The evaluation of a construction product for its environmental impact considers the longevity of the material the composition recycled materials maintenance requirements embodied energy and lifetime environmental impact 

Durability is at the core of green construction Terrazzo flooring can be refinished repeatedly reusing instead of replacing materials It can be restored to its original luster at a fraction of the cost of replacement Even century old floors have generally proven need little more than minor repairs and refinishing to return them to their original beauty

Terrazzo flooring also requires only minimal low cost maintenance Routine maintenance should be no more than dry and damp mopping with an occasional spray buffing Waxing or chemical cleaners only serve to cloud or damage the finish Annual stripping and resealing can be done with water based products 

Terrazzo is composed of naturally occurring aggregates recycled glass or plastic and processed cement or epoxy binders The binders constitute 25 30 percent of the volume of a floor the remainder is composed of aggregates pigments and fillers 

Post consumer recycled glass or post industrial stone from slab granite and marble processing increase the amount of recycled content in Terrazzo along with recycled aluminum divider strips

Both cement based and thin set epoxy Terrazzo systems are made of zero VOC materials Terrazzo produces little or no off gassing over the life of a cured floor The non porous Terrazzo finish resists microbial growth and moisture 

The potential for local sourcing is another environmental strength of Terrazzo Manufactured on site Terrazzo installations generally produce minimal post commercial waste and save on transportation costs 

On typical projects Terrazzo can realistically contribute to five LEED credits MRcr4 MRcr5 EQcr4 Terrazzo may also potentially contribute to MRcr1 and in extreme cases ldcr1 for a total of eight points

Maccabi Tel Aviv Football Club is an Israeli football club It is one of the oldest clubs in Israeli football The club is also the most successful They won 18 championships 22 national cups 2 Asian Champions Cups and 3 Toto cups The homeground of the team is the Bloomfield Stadium in Tel Aviv Yafo where also the city rival Hapoel Tel Aviv is playing

The club was founded in 1906 It was the first Jewish football club in Ottoman Palestine The name was then HaRishon Lezion Yaffo The first match was a 3 0 win against a team of French sailors After the foundation of Tel Aviv in 1909 the clubs name was changed into Maccabi Tel Aviv Maccabi was founding member of the Palestine Football Association and the Palestine League

In 1936 the club was invited to play in the United States On the way Maccabi played in France versus Racing Paris and Olympique Lille In the United States they played against an All star team of New York City in front of 50000 in Yankee Stadium Maccabi also defeated the American Soccer League team in Brooklyn and Philadelphia on their home ground 10 Other matches were against St Louis Stars and the Boston CelticsThey played also in Canada where they drew 11 with Toronto All Stars In 1939 they played 18 matches in Australia

After the independence in 1948 Tel Aviv was the most successful club in Israels top league In the 201112 season they reached the group stage of the UEFA Europa League The team played versus PSV Eindhoven Rapid Bucaresti and Legia Warsawa They failed to reach the next stage

The weber is named for the German physicist Wilhelm Eduard Weber

The weber may be defined in terms of Faradays law which relates a changing magnetic flux through a loop to the electric field around the loop A change in flux of one weber per second will induce an electromotive force of one volt 

Officially Weber The weber is the magnetic flux which linking a circuit of one turn would produce in it an electromotive force of 1 volt if it were reduced to zero at a uniform rate in 1 second

In SI base units the dimensions of the weber are Many times the weber is expressed in terms of other derived units as the Tesla square meter volt seconds or joules per ampere

The criticism of Buddhism is much like the criticism of any other religion It is mainly done by people who do not agree with what the religion says and what it believes The criticism often come from agnostics skeptics anti religion philosophy people who follow other religions or by Buddhists who want change

Criticisms include some beliefs that are only found in some Buddhist cultures and institutions These are not all true to original Buddhist principles Sam Harris a major believer of New Atheism and believers of Buddhist meditation say that many followers of Buddhism treat it as a religion in the wrong way They say that their beliefs are often naive petitionary and superstitious They think this stops the followers from living the true Buddhist principles

Some critics say that Buddhist followers and leaders have been interested in property and money They think that they are corrupt and are more interested in wealth and power rather than Buddhist principles There have been many sex scandals involving teachers in Western Buddhist groups

Michael Jerryson believes that Buddhism has been connected to government since its start He thinks that the inability to understand the idea of a country without Buddhism leads to a kind of religious nationalism He feels this is found in many Buddhist conflicts In medieval Southeast Asia there were many Buddhist states These included the Pagan Kingdom the Sukhothai Kingdom and the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa In Sri Lanka modern monks often took part in the politics of the country They did this even though the Buddha only believed in helping others make their own choice in the government Peace activists such as A T Ariyaratne have also used Buddhism for ways of doing things

The iguanodonts are members of the proposed group Iguanodontia This is a group of ornithopod families which some palaeontologists think are closely related

A local ordinance is a law usually found in a municipal code

In the United States these laws are enforced locally in addition to state law and federal law In some states the state legislature has limited the scope of local ordinances This approach was made popular by John Forrest Dillon called the Dillon Rule The law in such states says that local governments could only adopt ordinances when the state gives them authority on particular subjects States that do not follow the Dillon Rule believe that local government has inherent powers of self government In those states local government can make ordinances on any subject not prohibited by the state legislature

In Japan any prefecture or municipality may pass jrei under authority granted by Article 94 of the Constitution

There must generally be a statutory basis for an ordinance the ordinance must be in compliance with any overlapping statutes and the ordinance must be related to the affairs of the local government in question

Ordinances must generally be approved by a local assembly and promulgated by the mayor or governor of the local government in question who may demand a second vote but may not veto the ordinance

Under the Local Autonomy Law an ordinance may impose a penalty of up to two years imprisonment andor 1 million yen in fines although any penalty under an ordinance must be prescribed in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure There are even some ordinances such as bans on smoking on the street for which the police in some districts state that there is no penalty for failure to obey the ordinance

All laws enacted by the legislature of British colonies are referred to as Ordinances which sometimes delegate power to other parties to make subsidiary legislations that supplement the Ordinances In Hong Kong all laws enacted by the territorys Legislative Council remain to be known as Ordinances despite the transfer of the territory to the Peoples Republic of China in 1997

John Forrest Dillon was an American judge who served on both federal and Iowa state courts He wrote an important book on the power of states over municipal governments

Dillon was born in Northampton Montgomery County New York He studied medicine at the University of Iowa at the age of 19 Shortly after beginning to work as a doctor he switched to studying law and was admitted to the Iowa bar in 1852 He was elected as the Scott County prosecutor after a brief private practice in 1853 and was then elected to a judgeship in Iowas 7th Judicial Circuit in 1858 He joined to the Iowa Supreme Court in 1862 and served until 1869 when he was appointed by President Grant to the United States Circuit Court

While Dillon was a federal judge he wrote Municipal Corporations which was one of the earliest books to present the subject and people still study it today He was also the author of Removal of Cases from State Courts to Federal Courts and Municipal Bonds both in 1876 On February 17 1876 Justice Dillon ruled Ulysses S Grants deposition for Orville E Babcock was admissible in court during the Whiskey Ring graft prosecutions After leaving the Circuit Court Dillon was a professor at Columbia Law School from 1879 until 1882 where he taught real estate and equity He then taught at Yale Law School from 1891 until 1892 While at Yale he also was the president of the American Bar Association Dillon then returned to private practice until his death in 1914 in New York City

A memorial fountain to Dillon was built in downtown Davenport Iowa in 1918 Sculptor Harry Liva carved it out of Indiana limestone in Romanesque style

Dillons oldest son Hiram Price Dillon also became a lawyer in Iowa and a Master of Chancery in federal court Dillons sister was the grandmother of baseball manager Casey Stengel

The theory of state preeminence over local governments was called the Dillon Rule in an 1868 case Municipal corporations owe their origin to and derive their powers and rights wholly from the legislature It breathes into them the breath of life without which they cannot exist As it creates so may it destroy If it may destroy it may abridge and control Clinton v Cedar Rapids and the Missouri River Railroad As opposed to the Dillon Rule the Cooley Doctrine expressed the theory of an inherent right to local self determination In a concurring opinion Michigan Supreme Court Judge Thomas M Cooley in 1871 stated Local government is a matter of absolute right and the state cannot take it away People v Hurlbut

In Municipal Corporations Dillon explained that in contrast to the powers of states which are unlimited but for express restrictions under the state or federal constitution municipalities only have the powers that the state legislature expressly gives to them This formulation of the scope of municipal power came to be known as the Dillon Rule It says that municipal governments only have the powers that are expressly granted to them by the state legislature those that are necessarily implied from that grant of power and those that are essential and indispensable to the municipalitys existence and functioning If the legislative grant of power is unclear it should be read narrowly Courts should assume that the legislature did not mean to give a power unless that power was clearly spelled out in a law However when the state has not specifically directed the method by which the municipality may implement its granted power the municipality has the discretion to choose the method so long as its choice is reasonable

Hundreds of US court decisions to the present day have employed the Dillon Rule to determine the scope of municipal powers and rights Critics of the rule say that it imposes unreasonable constraints on the ability of communities to govern themselves and so undermines democracy and even that local self government is a matter of natural right that does not need to be conferred by higher political structures It has also been suggested that Dillons approach came from the view at that time that cities were inherently corrupt political organs Corruption was widespread during his time especially considering the extensive business ties and even investments of numerous cities and their leaders in the late 19th century Today most states in the United States follow the Dillon Rule This is true even though most people no longer believe that cities have corruption problems

The Supreme Court of the United States cited Dillons book Municipal Corporations and fully adopted Dillons emphasis on state power over municipalities in Merrill v Monticello 138 US 673 reaffd Hunter v Pittsburgh 207 US 161 which upheld the power of Pennsylvania to consolidate the city of Allegheny into the city of Pittsburgh despite the wishes of the majority of Allegheny residents to be a separate city The Courts ruling that states could alter or abolish at will the charters of municipal corporations without infringing upon contract rights relied upon Dillons separation of public municipal corporations from private ones

The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 1 May 1994 at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in Imola Italy It was the third race of the 1994 Formula One season Some things that happened at this race proved to be a major turning point in both the 1994 season and in the development of Formula 1 itself especially safety

During the race weekend Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger and three time world champion Ayrton Senna died in different accidents Other incidents saw driver Rubens Barrichello hurt and a few mechanics and spectators injured BBC Television commentator Murray Walker described it as the blackest day for Grand Prix racing that I can remember

Michael Schumacher won the race In the press conference after the race Schumacher said that he couldnt feel satisfied couldnt feel happy with his win following the events that had happened during the race weekend Nicola Larini scored the first points of his career when he finished in second position Mika Hkkinen finished third

The race led to a bigger focus on safety in Formula One as well as the reforming of the Grand Prix Drivers Association after 12 years of not running and the changing of many track layouts and car designs Since the race many regulation changes have been made to slow Formula One cars down and newer tracks such as Bahrain International Circuit have large run off areas to slow cars before they collide with a wall Senna was given a state funeral in his home country of Brazil where around 500000 people lined the streets to watch the coffin pass Italian prosecutors charged six people with manslaughter in connection with Sennas death all of whom were later found to be not guilty The case took more than 11 years to conclude due to an appeal and a re trial following the original not guilty verdict

On Friday 29 April during the first qualifying session to determine the starting order for the race Rubens Barrichello a driver for Jordan hit a kerb at the Variante Bassa corner at 140 miles an hour launching him into the air He hit the top of the tyre barrier and was knocked unconscious His Jordan rolled several times after landing before stopping slowly upside down Doctors teams treated him at the crash site and he was taken to the medical centre He returned to the race meeting the next day although his broken nose and a plaster cast on his arm forced him to sit out the rest of the race weekend Ten years after the incident Damon Hill who drove for the Williams Renault team at the time described the feeling after the crash We all brushed ourselves off and carried on qualifying reassured that our cars were tough as tanks and we could be shaken but not hurt

Twenty minutes into the final qualifying session Roland Ratzenberger failed to negotiate the Villeneuve curva in his Simtek he then hit the concrete barrier wall almost head on and was injured a lot Although the survival cell stayed largely together the force of the crash caused a basal skull fracture Ratzenberger in his first year as a Formula One driver ran over a kerb at the Acque Minerali corner on his previous lap causing a fault in his front wing Rather than come back to the pitlane he continued on another fast lap Going at 190 miles an hour his cars front wing failed leaving him unable to control it

The session was stopped whilst doctors attended to Ratzenberger The session was started approximately 25 minutes later but several teamsincluding Williams and Benettontook no further part Later in hospital it was announced that Ratzenberger had died as a result of his injuries His death marked the first Formula One race weekend death since the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix when Riccardo Paletti was killed It had been eight years since Elio de Angelis died testing a Brabham car at the Circuit Paul Ricard Professor Sid Watkins then head of the Formula One on track medical team recalled in his book about himself Ayrton Sennas reaction to the news stating that Ayrton broke down and cried on my shoulder Watkins tried to stop Senna from racing on the next day asking What else do you need to do You have been world champion three times you are obviously the quickest driver Give it up and lets go fishing but Ayrton said that Sid there are certain things over which we have no control I cannot quit I have to go on

Senna would start on pole position ahead of championship leader Michael Schumacher Gerhard Berger qualified in 3rd and Sennas team mate Damon Hill started from fourth position A time posted by Ratzenberger before his fatal crash would have been sufficient for entry into the race starting from the 26th and final position on the grid

At the start of the race JJ Lehtos Benetton did not move Pedro Lamy starting from further back on the grid had his view of the car blocked by other cars and hit the back of Lehtos car causing bodywork and tyres to fly into the air Parts of the car went over the safety fencing designed to protect spectators at the start line causing nine people to be hurt but not very much The incident caused the safety car to come out on track with all the drivers still in the race staying in the same place behind it while going at a slower speed During this period as a result of going at slower speeds tyre temperatures dropped At the drivers briefing before the race Senna along with Gerhard Berger had expressed concern that the safety car did not go fast enough to keep tyre temperatures high Once the track was reported clear of pieces of car the safety car went back into the pit lane and the race started again with a rolling start On the second lap after the restart with Ayrton Senna leading Michael Schumacher Sennas car left the road at the Tamburello corner and after slowing from 190 miles an hour to 131 miles an hour hit the concrete wall

At 217 pm local time a red flag was shown to show that the race was stopped and Sid Watkins came to the scene to treat Senna When a race is stopped under a red flag cars must slow down and make their way back to the starting grid until they are told what to do next This protects race marshalls and medical staff at the crash scene and allows for medical cars to get to the crash quicker Approximately 10 minutes after Sennas crash the Larrousse team made a mistake and allowed one of their drivers rik Comas to leave the pits despite the circuit being closed under red flags Marshalls slowed him down as he approached the scene of the accident travelling at pretty much full speed Eurosport commentator John Watson described the incident as the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen at any time in my life Comas avoided hitting any of the people or cars that were on the circuit but after going over towards Sennas accident scene he was so upset at what he saw that he withdrew from the race The pictures shown of Senna being treated on the world feed were very graphic and the BBC switched to their own camera focused on the pit lane BBC commentator Murray Walker has frequently talked about how upsetting it was to have to talk to viewers while avoiding all mention of the distressing pictures he could see on the world feed Senna was lifted from the wrecked Williams and flown to Maggiore Hospital in nearby Bologna Medical teams continued to treat him during the flight Thirty seven minutes after the crash at 255 pm local time the race was restarted

The results of the restarted race would be determined by the aggregate results of the stopped first race and the second race From the restart Gerhard Berger took the lead on track but Schumacher still led the race due to the amount of time he was ahead of Berger before the race was stopped Schumacher took the lead on track on lap 12 and four laps later Berger retired from the race with handling problems Larini briefly took the lead as Schumacher pitted but the order was restored when Larini took his own pit stop

Ten laps from the end the rear right wheel came loose from Michele Alboretos Minardi as it left the pit lane striking two Ferrari and two Lotus mechanics who were left needing hospital treatment

Michael Schumacher won the race ahead of Nicola Larini and Mika Hkkinen giving him a maximum 30 points after 3 rounds of the 1994 Formula One season It was the only podium finish of Larinis career and the first of just two occasions when he scored world championship points At the podium ceremony out of respect for Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna no champagne was sprayed

The Federal Judicial Center is the education and research agency of the United States federal courts An Act of Congress started it in 1967 The idea for a center came from the Judicial Conference of the United States 

The Center main activities are

The law sets who serves on the Centers Board of Directors The Chief Justice of the United States is ex officio chair of the Centers board The board also has the director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and seven judges elected by the Judicial Conference The Board appoints the Centers director and deputy director the director appoints the Centers staff Since its founding in 1967 the Center has had ten directors Judge Jeremy Fogel became director in 2011 He was appointed US district judge for the Northern District of California in 1998 but has been resident in Washington DC since becoming director The deputy director is John S Cooke

Chief Justice Earl Warren and other members of the judiciary wanted a separate agency that would conduct research and educational programs for the federal courts They hoped that a separate agency would build the judiciarys institutional independence They recommended starting the Federal Judicial center to Congress They hoped that regular programs of research and education would improve the efficiency of the federal courts and relieve the backlog of cases in the lower courts

The Center is governed by its own board The Federal Judicial Center offered the courts the benefits of independent social science research and educational programs designed to improve judicial administration 

In the 1950s and early 1960s the Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office increasingly commissioned research projects to examine problems of judicial administration at the same time that they organized educational programs to help judges manage growing and complicated caseloads These research and educational programs however received no permanent staff or funding Support for an institutionalized program of judicial research and education increased after adding 60 new district judge positions in 1961 showed that the number of judges alone would not solve all of the problems of overworked courts Many judges and lawyers asked for a way to bring improved research and education to the courts 

The Center includes several offices and divisions

The Directors Office is responsible for the Centers overall management and its relations with other organizations Its Office of Systems Innovation and Development provides technical support for Center education and research Communications Policy and Design edits produces and distributes all Center print and electronic publications operates the Federal Judicial Television Network and through the Information Services Office maintains a library of materials on judicial administration

The Research Division undertakes empirical and exploratory research on federal judicial processes court management and sentencing and its consequences often at the request of the Judicial Conference and its committees the courts themselves or other groups in the federal system James B Eaglin is the current director of the research division  

The Federal Judicial History Office develops programs relating to the history of the judicial branch and helps courts with their own judicial history programs

The Education Division holds educational sessions for federal judges and court staff Bruce Clarke is the current director of the Education Division

The Interjudicial Affairs Office caries out the Centers statutory mission to provide information about federal courts to officials of foreign judicial systems and to acquire information about foreign judicial systems that will help the Center perform its other missions

The Centers board consists of

After Moffat took over from Davies as executive producer River Song was in the 2010 series At an earlier point in her timeline in the two episode story The Time of AngelsFlesh and Stone River meets the Eleventh Doctor She is more familiar to him and he is more familiar to her At this point in her life River is a doctor She is not yet a professor She leaves coordinates for the Doctor to find so that he may save her in the 51st century With him she goes to learn about the crash of the spaceship Byzantium She shows herself to be better at flying the TARDIS than he is She tells the Doctor that she is imprisoned in the Stormcage Containment Facility for killing in her words the best man Ive ever known An even earlier version of River helps the Doctor in series finale The Pandorica OpensThe Big Bang After Winston Churchill talks to her while she is in prison she takes the Doctor to 102 AD While River is travelling in the TARDIS on her own it explodes with her inside The Doctor using an device that belonged River is able to save her and teleport her out She then helps him in closing the cracks in the universe After the Doctor removes himself from all of history to close the cracks in the universe River helps Amy Pond to remember the Doctor This brings him back She gives Amy her now blank diary At the end of the series finale The Doctor asks her whether she is married She says she is married and answers yes to a question she pretends think is him asking her to marry him She then tells to the Doctor that he will soon learn the truth about her after which everything changes

At the same time as the 2010 series Alex Kingston played River Song narrating the Monster Files on the BBC website It is a documentary about Doctor Who monsters This series had also been narrated by John Barrowman in character as Captain Jack Harkness

For the role of River Song they wanted to cast Kate Winslet One of Winslets first acting jobs was in the BBC1 teen drama Dark Season written by Davies The role of River Song went to Alex Kingston instead She is known for starring in the popular US drama ER On Kingstons casting Davies said I bloody love her Kingston had liked Doctor Who as a child Kingston when first cast did not expect her role to be more than just the two episodes She later learned that Moffat had always wanted for Song to come back for more episodes Kingston likes getting to play an unusual action hero female role

Talking about acting with Tennant and Catherine Tate in her 2008 episode Kingston said We just clicked Ive done guest roles on other shows but rarely have I felt such a warm bond About working with Kingston Catherine Tate said Im a huge ER fan When you hold people in awe its almost a disappointment when they come in and theyre utterly normal But Alex isnt disappointing at all Shes such a lovely person David Tennant said Alex is terrific When shes telling you stories about hanging out with George Clooney you know shes pretty cool

When asked about the Doctor Who dialogue she said Id work with a medical consultant on ER whod explain what we were saying so Id say it with a purpose and a truth On Doctor Who Ive no idea what some of my lines mean

The character was first created to help the plot of Silence in the Library to make more sense Moffat knew that the team of archaeologists would have to trust the Doctor but the Doctor could not get them to understand how he had gotten into the closed library Because of this Moffat wanted for the Doctor to know one of the archaeologists but he thought that the idea was dull He chose to have one of them know him When Kingston returned to the show Moffat told her some details about her characters back story This was information that Smith Gillan and Darvill did not learn until later Kingston knows her character cannot be killed off because her death was seen in her first episode Each episode she is in after that is earlier in her personal history 

An article published in Metro titled Doctor Who fans love River Song said how good comments from fans on Twitter after the airing of Day of the Moon were mainly about Song

Keith Phipps for The AV Club compared the Doctor and Rivers romantic storyline to The Curious Case of Benjamin Button

Neela Debnath of The Independent liked Nina Toussaint White as Mels She said she was every bit as sassy and vivacious as her later incarnationit was shame that she regenerated so early on because she brought a different energy to the character However Neil McCormick in The Daily Telegraph felt that her being quickly added as Rory and Amys childhood friend showed that Moffat was making it up as he went along

Oliver Heaviside was a self taught English electrical engineer mathematician and physicist Although he was well known in the scientific world during his lifetime it was not until after his death that people realized how much he had changed the study of mathematics and physics He used complex numbers to study electrical circuits and did a lot of work on electromagnetic wave theory which made it necessary to find new ways of working with differential equations He did work on Maxwells field equations and vector analysis Part of the ionosphere is co named after him the Kennelly Heaviside layer His personality was very eccentric and he is a good example of what many people think of as a mad scientist

Heaviside was born in Camden Town London His father was a skilled wood engraver His uncle Sir Charles Wheatstone co invented the telegraph and made famous experiments in 1837 from Euston Station He was short and he had red hair When he was young he suffered from scarlet fever which made him rather deaf especially in his later years Heaviside studied at Camden House School until he was 16 and continued to study at home until he was 18 He got a job as telegraph operator and spent some time working in Denmark He noticed that operating speeds were 40 faster from England to Denmark than the other way round and in 1871 he found a fault in the telegraph cable from England to Denmark In 1873 he got a copy of the first edition of Maxwells book A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism He was very influenced by this book and it helped him to produce many mathematical ideas At this time he was working in Newcastle In 1875 he went back to London to live with his parents There he spent a lot of time writing up his discoveries but no one wanted to publish his papers because they were too difficult to understand He analysed alternating currents 15 years before they started to be used commercially

When his parents moved to Paignton he moved with them After their deaths he lived at Newton Abbott and then from 1908 until death in Torquay He remained unmarried all his life

In his old age Heaviside became more and more eccentric He was poor and lived alone in a large house in Torquay that he could not afford to heat properly He liked it when friends visited but many people were put off because he could often be rude He could not cook and a friendly policeman regularly came to the house to bring him food Because Heaviside was deaf and could not hear the knock on the door the policeman used to open the letterbox and blow his whistle loudly The house and garden was in a terrible mess He had lumps of granite in his house for furniture He often put the letters WORM after his name just for a joke He took to painting his finger nails pink On at least one occasion he dyed his hair black and while it was wet he wore a teacosy on his head

When in 1925 he fell off a ladder and was taken by ambulance to a nursing home it was the first time he had ever been in a motor vehicle He told the ambulance driver that he had enjoyed the ride He died at the nursing home in Torquay a month later and was buried in Paignton 

Heaviside made studies on how to transmit speech clearly in telephone communication He studied reflection in telephone circuits From 1886 he spent most of his time on the propagation of electromagnetic waves through space which had been developed by Hertz and on the motion of atoms which had been discovered by JJ Thomson In his last article in Electomagnetic Theory he discusses disturbances conducted electromagnetically or gravitationally saying

it followsthat the destruction of this wicked world may come at any moment without any warning 

Without realizing it he was prophesying the atomic bomb

Heaviside was not interested in receiving honours Indeed he never made any money from his discoveries and often found it difficult to pay the bills He was probably very pleased to be made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1891 He was awarded a 120 a year Civil List pension by the government In 1908 he was elected an Honorary Member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers and in 1918 Honorary Membership of the Americal Institute of Electrical Engineers In 1921 he was the first person to be honoured with the Faraday Medal

A famous quotation of Heaviside is I do not refuse my dinner simply because I do not understand the process of digestion

There is a reference to the Heaviside layer in the musical Cats

The KennellyHeaviside layer also known as the E region is part of the ionosphere It is a region which is between 90km and 150km from the earths surface It is named after the American engineer Arthur Edwin Kennelly and the British scientist Oliver Heaviside These two scientists both predicted that this area existed although it was not until some years later that it was proved

In the Kennelly Heaviside layer neutral molecules are split into electrons and positively charged molecules Radio waves can be bounced off the this region so that long distance radio messages can be sent over long distances around the curved surface of the earth This was why Marconi had been able to send radio messages across the Atlantic in 1902 although it was not understood at the time

Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport airport codesITHKITHITH is a county owned public use airport three miles northeast of the central business district of Ithaca the county seat and largest city in Tompkins County New York United States The airport is near New York State Route 13 It serves the southern Finger Lakes Region It is used for private as well as commercial passenger and freight aviation

For over 50 years the East Hill Flying Club has been at the airport The club offers lessons and the use of seven small planes to its members Taughannock Aviation which provides business jet charter and management is the fixed base operator for the airport

The original Ithaca Municipal Airport was located west of downtown Ithaca near the inlet of Cayuga Lake Its single short runway proximity to the Lehigh Valley freight yards on the south side the Cayuga Lake marshes on the north side and fog in the lake valley limited its growth Cornell University opened the existing airport on East Hill in 1948 and transferred its ownership to the County in 1956 The former airport site is now Cass Park including an airplane hangar which was renovated in 1975 to house the Hangar Theatre

The original airport was the base where aviation pioneer Cecil Robinson began flying aerial photography missions In 1945 shortly after the end of World War II he created Robinson Airlines basing its maintenance operations at the airport The airline changed its name to Mohawk Airlines in 1952 and merged with Allegheny Airlines in 1972 Later the airport was also served by Empire Airlines and Air North the of latter which became Brockway Air which was merged into Piedmont Airlines Allegheny Piedmont and Empire were all eventually merged into US Airways 

Other carriers that served the airport include Commuter Airlines Mall Airways Command Airways TW Express and Continental Express

In 1994 the runway was extended from convert5801ftm in length to its present convert6601ftm and an entirely new 33000 square foot terminal building opened replacing the cramped aging original building The airport name changed from Tompkins County Airport to its current name on March 20 2001 The northwest facing runway 32 has an instrument landing system approach and an associated medium intensity approach light system with runway alignment lights Runway 14 facing southeast has an instrument approach based on the VORDME located at the airport A short turf runway was built parallel to the paved runway but during the 1980s another turf runway oriented north south was available to the west of the terminal building and was approximately convert1802ftm long and convert100ftm wide

Commercial traffic peaked in 1990 at 226813 passengers By 2000 the airport lost three of its major carriers The airport was hurt by the small size of the market relative proximity to Syracuse Hancock International Airport and other regional airports and crowded conditions in Northeastern airspace Trans World Airlines United Airlines and finally Continental Airlines left to serve more profitable routes leaving US Airways the sole carrier

In late 2004 after negotiations with the County Northwest Airlines agreed to add Northwest Airlink service to Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport which began on May 2 2005 US Airways nonstop service to Pittsburgh resumed on November 9 2005 but stopped again on April 1 2006 due to low use Passenger traffic improved with the additional service the airport served about 140000 passengers in 2004 increasing to around 170000 in 2007

On October 6 2008 Continental Connection resumed service between Ithaca and Newark Liberty International Airport with four daily flights

Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport covers an area of convert531acreha which contains two runways 1432 with 6601 x 150 ft asphalt pavement and 1533 with a 2018 x 50 ft turf surface

In astronomy a light curve is a graph that shows the brightness of light from a celestial object or region as a over a certain amount of time The light is usually in a particular frequency interval or band Light curves can be periodic that is they repeat in a regular pattern Examples are eclipsing binaries and cepheid variables Light curves can also be aperiodic that is they are irregular with no pattern Examples include the light curve of a nova a cataclysmic variable star a supernova or a microlensing event The study of the light curve together with other observations can give a lot of information about the physical process that produces it or constrain the physical theories about it

In the study of planets a light curve can be used to work out the rotation period of a minor planet moon or comet nucleus From the Earth many objects are so small that even the most powerful telescopes are unable to see objects clearly Because of this astronomers measure the amount of light produced by the object over a period of time its light curve The time between the peaks on the graph gives the rotational period of the object The difference between the maximum and minimum brightness the amplitude of the light curve can be caused by either the shape of the object or bright and dark areas on the surface For example an odd shaped asteroids light curve generally has more pronounced peaks while a more spherical objects light curve will be flatter When the light curve covers a long period of time it is called a secular light curve

In botany a light curve shows the photosynthetic response of a leaf or algae to the brightness of a light The shape of the curve shows the principle of limiting factors In low light the rate of photosynthesis is limited by the amount of chlorophyll and the efficiency of the light dependent reactions In higher light levels it is limited by the efficiency of RuBisCO and the amount of carbon dioxide The point on the graph where these two differing lines meet is called the light saturation point This is where the light dependent reactions are making more ATP and NADPH than can be used by the light independent reactions Since photosynthesis is also limited by ambient carbon dioxide levels light curves are often repeated at several different constant carbon dioxide concentrations

Long Beach Airport Airport codesLGBKLGBLGB also known as Daugherty Field is a city owned public use airport three nautical miles northeast of the central business district of the City of Long Beach in Los Angeles County California United States It serves Los Angeles and Orange Counties It was formerly known as Long Beach Municipal Airport

This airport is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 20112015 which categorized it as a primary commercial service airport As per Federal Aviation Administration records the airport had 1413251 passenger boardings in calendar year 2008 1401903 enplanements in 2009 and 1451404 in 2010

Long Beach Airport has less passenger service compared with the Los Angeles International Airport which is 18 miles to the northwest Long Beach will always remain a relatively small airport because of local ordinances designed to reduce noise The airport is under one of the strictest ordinances in the United States on both airport noise and the number of commercial flights The current noise levels allow for 41 daily commercial flights and 25 commuter flights Local community groups and activists are worried any about changes at the airport Low cost carrier JetBlue Airways came to Long Beach Airport in 2001 JetBlue uses Long Beach as a West Coast hub Air traffic to the airport increased from major East Coast cities While JetBlue used the local noise ordinance to turn Long Beach Airport into a miniature fortress hub it quickly reached maximum capacity The airline been forced to change flight times and direct future growth to other Los Angeles area airports JetBlue calls LGB a focus city and now operates 31 of the 41 slots

Air cargo carriers including FedEx and UPS also use LGB 57000 tons of goods are transported each year

The Boeing Company maintains production of the C 17 military transport jet maintenance facilities for other Boeing and McDonnell DouglasDouglas aircraft are also found at Long Beach Airport Gulfstream Aerospace also has a completionservice center at the airport

Although commercial flights are severely restricted there are still a large number of flights at the airport from charter flights private aviation flight schools law enforcement flights helicopters advertising blimps planes towing advertising banners etc Because of that Long Beach airport is one of the busiest general aviation airports in the world with 398433 aircraft movements in 2007

Long Beach Airport has a single airport terminal It is notable for its Streamline Moderne style of architecture and is a historical landmark In December 2010 the airport began building a new passenger concourse that will cost 45 million With the new gates the terminal will grow to 74000 square feet The airport also added an additional parking garage

Long Beach Transit Routes 111 104 and 102 serve the airport Wardlow Road runs from the airport to the Los Angeles CountyOrange County border where it becomes Ball Road and crosses the northern edge of the Disneyland Resort

Long Beach Airport is the second closest airport to Disneyland after John Wayne Airport

The first transcontinental flight a biplane flown by Calbraith Perry Rodgers landed in 1911 on Long Beachs sandy beach From 1911 until the airport was built planes continued to use the beach as a runway 

The famous barnstormer Earl S Daugherty had leased the area that later became the airport for air shows stunt flying wing walking and passenger rides Later he started the worlds first flight school in 1919 In 1923 Daugherty convinced the City council to use the site to build the first municipal airport

During the 1940s and 1950s the only airline nonstops were to Los Angeles San Diego and sometimes Catalina Island In 1962 Western Airlines started one Lockheed Electra flight a day to San Francisco Jets arrived in 1968 In 1969 Western had nonstop 737s to Las Vegas Oakland and San Francisco but by 1980 SFO was the only nonstop jet destination

In 1981 the startup airline Jet America started nonstop MD80 service to Chicago and in 1982 to Dallas Fort Worth In 1982 Alaska Airlines started nonstop flights to Portland and Seattle In 1983 American started ORD and DFW and United started flights to Denver In 1984 United had two daily 767s to Denver which were the largest aircraft ever scheduled into Long Beach

In the period between 1990 and 1992 Continental Delta TWA and USAir stopped using the airport In early 2006 American Airlines had also pulled out because of a lack of profitability 

In 2008 the Long Beach Airport began generating electricity with six 9 feet by 9 feet solar arrays The arrays are located around the terminal in the outdoor baggage claim area The project will offset nearly a 500000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions

To attract the United States Navy the City of Long Beach built a hangar and an administrative building and then offered to lease it to the Navy for 1 a year for the establishment of the Naval Reserve Air Base On May 10 1928 the US Navy commissioned the field as a Naval Reserve Air Base Two years later the city built a hangar and administrative building for the United States Army Air Corps as well It should be stated that the only significant developments to the little city airport began only after the city built hangars and administrative facilities for the Army and Navy in 1928 30

As a Naval Reserve Air Base the mission was to instruct train and drill Naval Reserve aviation personnel A ground school was offered three nights a week at the base and two nights a week at the University of California in Los Angeles until 1930 when ground school was continuously offered at the base On April 9 1939 training in night flight began and shortly thereafter its facilities began to be used by fleet aircraft as well

However with increased air activity by commercial airlines and the private airplane industry particularly with Douglas Aircraft showing an interest in the Long Beach Municipal Airport the facility required more space With Douglas Aircraft as a resident the attitude of Long Beachs authorities became cold and openly hostile to naval aviation with its city manager saying that the sooner the Navy gets out of the Long Beach airport the better we will like it

Because of this hostile attitude the Navy had begun a survey for a more suitable site unknown to city officials at the time Nevertheless Admiral Ernest J King then the Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics and Admirals William D Leahy Joseph K Taussig and Allen E Smith pointedly requested that the city of Long Beach repair the runways and reminded the city that the Pacific Fleet then laying offshore in both Long Beach and San Pedro harbors had a payroll of more than 1 million a month Eventually the city complied with the Navys requests

Still the city continued to show a hostile attitude toward approving a lease on any additional land that the Naval Reserve required

The Navy was fed up with the city of Long Beach It decided upon the purchase of some property owned by Susanna Bixby Bryant a fact made known by the commander of the base Commander Thomas A Gray to the Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics Admiral John H Towers The circumstances behind the purchase were revealed to James V Forrestal Under Secretary of the Navy and by him to the House Naval Affairs committee who approved the purchase Although Comdr Gray had offered Mrs Bryant 350 an acre in the best patriotic spirit she sold the property at 300 an acre The land is 4 miles east of the Long Beach Airport

With the site acquired in 1941 construction funds soon followed and NAS Los Alamitos began to take shape Upon the transfer of the Naval Reserve Training Facility to Los Alamitos quite to the surprise of city officials of Long Beach in 1942 instead of returning the Naval Reserve Air Base facilities at Long Beach to the city the Navy simply turned over the facilities to the United States Army Air Forces which had also established a training base adjacent to it

Nevertheless with war clouds on the horizon the NARB Long Beach was not totally abandoned but simply downgraded to that of a Naval Auxiliary Air Station

The 1940s was a very busy time for the Long Beach airport Throughout World War II the airfield was used for the war effort In August 1941 the Civil Aeronautics Administration took over control of the airport which had increased to convert500acrekm2 Once Los Alamitos became an operational base in 1941 NAAS Long Beach now turned to servicing carrier borne F4Fs SBDs FM 2s F4Us F6Fs TBFTBMs and SB2Cs In addition it had utility aircraft and such patrol planes as the PBY SNB GB3 NH GH and SNJ

As the Navys activities began to be shifted to Los Alamitos the Long Beach Army Airfield at Long Beach became the home of the Armys Air Transport Commands Ferrying Division which included a squadron of 18 women pilots commanded by Barbara London a long time Long Beach aviatrix

Like the Naval Air Ferry Command at NAS Terminal Island the Armys ferrying work was an immense undertaking thanks to Douglas Aircrafts wartime production Ground breaking for the initial Douglas Aircraft facility occurred in November 1940 with dedication in October 1941 Douglas had been drawn to Long Beach primarily because of the presence of the towns growing municipal airport and the presence of both the Army and Navy there With wartime contracts the company immediately went into intensive production The companys first C 47 was delivered 16 days after the attack of Pearl Harbor and another 4238 were produced during the war Additionally the plant turned out some 1000 A 20 Havocs not to mention 3000 B 17 Flying Fortresses and 1156 A 26 Invaders

With the end of the war the US Navy abandoned any use of the Long Beach Municipal Airport facility completely and with it the designation of Long Beach as a Naval Auxiliary Air Station McDonnell Douglas continued to produce passenger jets on the north side of the airport until its merger with Boeing in 1997 Boeing continued limited operations

On March 18 2009 President Barack Obamas Air Force One landed at Long Beach Airport for the Presidents town hall meetings in Orange County and Los Angeles President Obama made an appearance on Jay Lenos Tonight Show in Burbank on March 19 2009

Long Beach Daugherty Field Airport covers an area of 1166 acres at an elevation of 60 feet above mean sea level It has five asphalt paved runways

For the year ending December 1 2010 the airport had 329808 aircraft operations an average of 903 per day 87 general aviation 10 scheduled commercial 3 air taxi and 1 military At that time there were 435 aircraft based at this airport 69 single engine 11 multi engine 11 jet and 10 helicopter

The gates at Long Beach Airport are divided into the North and South Concourse each with four gates Gates in the North Concourse are numbered 21 22 23A and 23B while gates in the South Concourse are numbered 1 2 2A 3 4 and 4A Passengers wait for planes in temporary trailers

The following airlines offer scheduled passenger service

After years of controversy and a court battle involving local schools the Long Beach Airport is moving ahead with a 136 million improvement project designed to modernize the facility without sacrificing its historic Art Deco terminal or reputation among travelers for convenience 

Plans call for a new 1989 space parking structure ramp improvements and a concourse with a central garden and 11 gates that will replace the temporary trailers where travelers now wait for flights About 2 million will be spent to refurbish the old terminal which was built in 1941 and declared a historic landmark by the city decades later

The project however will retain the open air feeling of the current terminal complex and passengers will still walk across the tarmac when boarding or leaving their planes Baggage claim also will be partially enclosed as it is today
