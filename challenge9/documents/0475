Chaos theory is a part of mathematics It looks at certain systems that are very sensitive A very small change may make the system behave completely differently 

Very small changes in the starting position of a chaotic system make a big difference after a while This is why even large computers cannot tell the weather for more than a few days in the future Even if the weather was perfectly measured a small change or error will make the prediction completely wrong Since even a butterfly can make enough wind with its wings to do this a chaotic system is sometimes called the butterfly effect No computer knows enough to tell how the small wind will change the weather

Some systems might appear random at first look but Chaos Theory says that these kinds of systems or patterns may not be If people pay close enough attention to what is really going on they might notice the chaotic patterns

The main idea of chaos theory is that a minor difference at the start of a process can make a major change in it as time progresses Quantum chaos theory is a new idea in the study of chaos theory It deals with quantum physics

As an example take a pendulum that is attached at some point and swings freely Connecting a second pendulum to the first will make the system completely different It is very hard to start in the exact same position again  a change in starting position so small that it cannot even be seen can quickly cause the pendulum swing to become different from what it was before 

A very important part to the study of chaos theory is the study of mathematics functions that are known as fractals Fractal functions work like chaotic systems a small change in the starting values can change the value of the function in ways that look random Due to the fact that they are mathematical they are easy to study

The Panama Canal is a waterway in the country of Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean The Panama Canal uses three locks for lifting and lowering the ships on different water levels Each year about 14000 ships come through the canal By 2002 around 800000 ships came through The French tried building it in 1880 but failed It was finally finished in 1914 by the United States who spent ten years on building it The canal is 77 km long cutting across the Isthmus of Panama and saves ships 15000 km If a ship is too big to go through the Panama Canal it has to go around South America 

It is an interesting fact that because of the way Panama twists the entrance to the Pacific Ocean is farther east than the entrance to the Atlantic Ocean This is the opposite of what one would expect

Equipping means getting specialized clothing and equipment Different suggestions can be found on each point in any hiking book A hiker is suggested to learn more than one source and work Equipping sometimes needs getting skills in using the apparatus Basic skillsdifferent ways of orientationmust be developed before hiking

Hiking itself lies in the observation of the presented steps and hikers skills There are different hiking tips and suggestions in the internet

Hiking can quickly become a fight for living For the reason everything in hiking is very important Nobody can be suggested to hike alone no matter what the situation until a hiker fell certain of his expert hiking abilities 

Every hiker should keep in mind that theory is important but it can hardly replace firsthand experience To feel himself safe a traveller should have enough experience A hiker had better start by taking short hikes

A hiker is strongly suggested to check from time to time whether he is on the right way On no account should he go on travelling if he finds out he has lost his way The first thing a hiker should to do is to find the about direction in which he was travelling before getting lost Using the compass and the map he should choose a reference point nearby

The vinyl record is a way to record music that was popular during most of the twentieth century Vinyl records are played on a phonograph

A vinyl record is a disk made of vinyl plastic The sound is recorded on a very fine line or groove which goes around and around in a spiral from the outside edge of the disk to the center The phonograph plays the sound with a needle that touches the groove A record usually has different music on each side

Thomas Edison made early phonographs in the 1870s He originally used wax cylinders to record the sound but disks were soon used instead first made out of bakelite and then vinyl Singles usually carried only one or two songs or recordings EPs carried from three to five songs Albums carried many more recordings a dozen was normal or from 30 to 45 minutes of playing time These formats are still used today with digital recordings and playing time for singles and albums has grown considerably

Vinyl records lost popularity but never went out of production Now in recent years vinyl is gaining popularity while CD record shops have gone out of business more and more vinyl only record shops are opening Many argue the higher sound quality of vinyl compared to newer formats

A solstice is an astronomical event that happens twice each year when the Sun reaches its highest position in the sky as seen from the North or South Pole The day of the solstice is either the longest day of the year or the shortest day of the year for any place on Earth because the length of time between sunrise and sunset on that day is the yearly maximum or minimum for that place The name is derived from the Latin words sol and sistere During the solstice the Sun stands still that is the seasonal movement of the Suns path comes to a stop before reversing direction The Northern Solstice occurs in June when the sun is at its highest point seen from the North Pole The Southern Solstice occurs in December when the sun is at its highest point seen from the South Pole

The solstices together with the equinoxes are connected with the seasons In some cultures they mark either the beginning or the middle of summer and winter

The June Solstice happens when the Northern Hemisphere of the Earth is tilted toward the Sun and the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth is tilted away from the Sun At the North Pole the Sun reaches its highest point in the sky and then begins moving lower At the moment of the June solstice the Sun is directly overhead some point on the Tropic of Cancer this is the furthest north that the subsolar point ever reaches In the Northern Hemisphere the June solstice is called the Summer Solstice while in the Southern Hemisphere it is called the Winter Solstice The June Solstice is usually on June 21

The December Solstice happens when the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth is tilted toward the Sun and the Northern Hemisphere of the Earth is tilted away from the Sun At the South Pole the Sun reaches its highest point in the sky and then begins moving lower At the moment of the December solstice the Sun is directly overhead some point on the Tropic of Capricorn this is the furthest south that the subsolar point ever reaches In the Southern Hemisphere the December solstice is called the Summer Solstice while in the Northern Hemisphere it is called the Winter Solstice The December Solstice is usually on December 21

While the exact causes were long unknown the effect was recognised in many ancient cultures Many of the pre Christian cultures like the druidic the Germanic and the Norse faith therefore celebrated these events as holidays

When the importance of the old faiths vanished the Christian religion took over some of the festivities which were then carried out in the honour of a new occasion For instance the date of Christmas in the Catholic and Protestant faith is just 3 days away from the December Solstice

The double bass is a large stringed instrument used in orchestras jazz bands rockabilly bands bluegrass music and some country music bands It plays low pitched musical notes in musical ensembles and bands In jazz bands these low pitched musical notes are called the bass line The double bass looks like smaller instruments like the violin viola and cello

The double bass is usually built from wood Double basses have a hollow wooden body which helps to amplify the sounds of the instrument A wooden neck is attached to the body and a flat wooded fingerboard is glued onto the neck It usually has four metal strings which are strung with tension on the neck

In an orchestra double bass players bow the strings with a wooden bow strung with horsehair or pluck the strings with their fingers In jazz the double bass is played pizzicato most of the time However some jazz players use the bow to play melodies on the double bass

To play different notes on the double bass double bass players hold down the metal strings against the fingerboard with their left hand and then bow the string or pluck it with their right hand To play different notes the double bass players move the left hand to different positions on the fingerboard

Double bass players in jazz bands or rock bands often connect their double bass to an electronic amplifier and a loudspeaker to make a louder stronger sound This makes it easier for the double bass playerthe other musicians and the audience to hear the double basss musical notes

The double bass is usually considered a member of the violin family because it is constructed using many of the same techniques as violins The double bass also has influences from the viol family Viols are old string instruments from the 1400s and 1500s with sloping shoulders on the instruments body and flat backs Like the viols the double bass also has sloping shoulders on its body and a flat back

The double bass is generally tuned in fourths in contrast to members of the orchestral string family which are tuned in fifths Modern double basses are usually tuned low to high E A D G which is one octave lower than the four lowest pitch strings on a guitar

Throughout classical repertoire there are notes that fall below the range of a standard double bass Notes below low E appear regularly in double bass parts in the Baroque and Classical eras when the double bass was typically doubling the cello part an octave below In the Romantic era and the 20th century composers such as Mahler Beethoven Busoni and Prokofiev also requested notes below the low E There are two common methods for making these notes available to the player Major European orchestras generally use basses with a fifth string tuned to B three octaves and a semitone below middle C Players with standard double basses typically play the notes below E an octave higher

In the United States Canada and United Kingdom most professional orchestral players use four string double basses with a C extension which extends the lowest string down as far as low C an octave below the lowest note on the cello More rarely would one find a four string double bass with a B extension extending the lowest string down to a low B The extension is an extra section of fingerboard mounted up over the head of the bass There are several varieties of extensions

In the simplest version there are no mechanical aids attached to the fingerboard extension except a locking nut for the E note To play the extension notes the player reaches back over the pegs to press the string to the fingerboard The advantage of this fingered extension is that the player can adjust the intonation of all of the stopped notes on the extension and there are no mechanical noises from metal keys and levers The disadvantage of the fingered extension is that it can be hard to perform rapid alternations between low notes on the extension and notes on the regular fingerboard such as a bassline that quickly alternates between G and the low D

The simplest type of mechanical aid is the use of wooden fingers that can be closed to press the string down and fret the C D Eb or E notes This system is particularly useful for basslines that have a repeating pedal point such as a low D because once the note is locked in place with the mechanical finger the lowest string then sounds a different note when it is played open With the B extension the fingers can fret the low C

The double bass also has many other names Some bluegrass musicians call it a bass fiddle or a bull fiddle Rockabilly bands often call it an upright bass or Doghouse Some orchestra musicians call it a contrabass In a military concert band it is often called the string bass Sometimes the double bass is simply called a bass

In Newfoundland most people speak English but there are also French speakers on the island mostly in the south west In some areas of Newfoundland people speak with an accent and use words that are not in standard English There is even a dictionary of Newfoundland English 

People first came to Newfoundland from countries like Norway England Portugal France and Ireland in the 16th century The first explorers were the Vikings from Norway and they settled in LAnse aux Meadows They came because of the good fishing off the coast especially off the south east coast Eventually they left because of disagreements with aboriginalsToday there is still fishing but not very much because people fished too much and now there are not many fish left

Cutting down trees and mining have also been attractions of the island There are some paper mills in a few cities in Newfoundland

The Visioners Tale is one of the little known writings of Geoffrey Chaucer  Only parts of the story were left from when Chaucer wrote it in the 14th century so it is not normally included in modern versions of the Canterbury Tales

Here is the tale as put together by someone from Denmark who studied the parts of the story and tried to put them together

Geoffrey Chaucer was an English writer poet and philosopher He is most famous for writing Canterbury Tales which had 24 stories but were not completed He was one of the first writers to write in English

Chaucer was probably born in London His father John and grandfather were prosperous wine merchants in London The name Chaucer is French and means shoemaker However we do not know many details of his early life and education

By 1357 Chaucer was a page to Elizabeth Countess of Ulster wife of Lionel 1st Duke of Clarence In 1360 he was captured by the French near Reims during a battle in the Hundred Years War He was then ransomed and released King Edward III gave 16 towards his release Chaucer married Phillipa Roet She was a lady in waiting to the queen and had close family connections to John of Gaunt He had about three or four children

Chaucer may have studied law in the Inner Temple He joined the Royal Court and travelled a lot around Europe on business for the king He became one of the kings esquires One of his first known poems was written in 1369 It was called The Book of The Duchess and was written after the death of John of Gaunts wife Blanche In 1374 he became Comptroller of the Customs for the Port of London He did this job for 12 years It was a well paid job and Chaucer was quite wealthy

When Richard II became king Chaucer continued to working in Customs He was also sent to Europe on several more diplomatic jobs for the king

Chaucer moved to Kent in 1385 where he had a new position as Justice of the Peace He was also elected as one of two knights of the shire to be a member of parliament At the end of the year he lost his customs jobs His wife Phillipa died in 1387 But on 12 July 1389 he was made the Clerk of the Kings Works looking after repairs to the royal palaces He was given other small positions including looking after the river banks of the Thames and as a deputy forester in the Royal Forest Over the next few years Chaucer became poorer and often was given small payments and pensions from the king

He died at StMarys Chapel in sevemoaks on 25 October 1400 Chaucer is buried in Westminster Abbey in what is now called the Poets Corner

Chaucer did most of his writing between 1369 and 1393 He is famous for his collection of stories called the Canterbury Tales

Genus Zaglossus 

Echidna the spiny anteater is a monotreme that lives in Australia and in New Guinea They form the family Tachyglossidae

Echnidas have a long tube like mouth with a sticky tongue and they are also covered in spines They have mammary glands and lay eggs 

The echidna has a way of protecting itself With its long sharp claws they quickly dig a hole until only their spines are accessible The predator will not be able to get to it without injuring itself When there is a fire the Echidna will dig down out of reach of the fire 

Spiny anteaters eat ants They also eat other small insects Echidnas pick up the bugs with their sticky tongues

The 2002 Bali terrorist bombings took place in Kuta on the Indonesian island of Bali The attack was the deadliest act of terrorism in the history of Indonesia Kuta is a popular tourist destination 202 people were killed 164 of them were foreigners 38 were Indonesian citizens Most of those killed were Australians Americans or IndonesiansIn addition 209 people were injured 

At around 11 in the evening a bomb destroyed a bar on Bali The bomb was in a backpack and only the person that owned it died A few seconds later a larger bomb went off This bomb was close to 1000 kilograms

A terrorist group called Jemaah Islamiyah are believed to be responsible for making and exploding the device

In total four people were charged with the terrorist attack An Indonesian court sentenced three of them to death One person received a long prison sentence

The Boeing 17 Flying Fortress was a heavy bomber that was used by the United States Eighth Air Force during World War II It first flew in 1935 and was introduced in 1938 It had a shorter range and a smaller bomb load then its sister bomber the B 24 Liberator but it had more defensive arment It dropped large amounts of bombs and was also used during air raids against Germany such as the raid on Dresden The B 17 was also used in the Pacific at the Battle of Midway They were known for being able to get shot by enemy fighters many times and keep flying the B 17 was a heavy duty bomber plane that carried 2 tons of bombs Not many B 17s survived WWII It was the result of the lack of escortations of fighters Although the Flying Fortress took down many opposing fighters they also took a beating Later in WWII the US air force decided to add escortations to the bombers giving them more protection The escortations lasted till the end of WWII 

Midway Atoll was the site of a famous battle in World War II the Battle of Midway The atoll is currently held by the United States of America

Phosphorus has the chemical symbol P and its atomic number is 15 Its mass number is 3097 It is not found in nature as an element but as compounds such as phosphates It can be a red or a white waxy solid

Phosphorus comes in several forms White and red phosphorus are the most common forms White phosphorus is a waxy white solid When pure it is colourless It is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulphide an organic solvent It turns light yellow when in air It glows in the dark because it burns very slowly in air 

When exposed to sunlight or when heated in its own vapour to 250 C it is converted to the red variety This form does not ignite spontaneously and it is less toxic and less flammable than white phosphorus The red modification is fairly stable and sublimes with a vapor pressure of 1 atmosphere at 417 C

White phosphorus is more reactive than red phosphorus White phosphorus catches fire spontaneously in air burning to make smoke of phosphorus oxide If it burns in a little air it produces poisonous phosphorus oxide When white phosphorus is heated in an alkali it disproportionates to produce hypophosphites and phosphine Red phosphorus can burn but needs to be ignited Phosphorus reacts with the halogens to make phosphorus halides It reacts with some metals to make phosphides

Phosphorus forms chemical compounds in several oxidation states 3 1 3 and 5 3 is found in phosphine and phosphides They are strong reducing agents 1 compounds are found in hypophosphites They are strong reducing agents too They are toxic 3 compounds are found in phosphites They are reducing agents They are toxic too 5 compounds are found in phosphates and phosphoric acid They are normally non reactive and non toxic Phosphates are the most common phosphorus compounds All of the other ones are rare

 FileFosforsyrajpgPhosphoric acid FileTrisodium phosphate hydratejpgTrisodium phosphate FilePhosphorus pentachloride and Phosphorus trichlorideJPGthumbPhosphorus pentachloride and phosphorus trichloride 

It is an essential component of living systems and is found as phosphate in nervous tissue bones and cell protoplasm It is also found in the earth as phosphate rock Phosphate rock is the main source of phosphorus and phosphorus compounds Many body tissues have calcium phosphates in them

Phosphorus was first made by heating a mixture of phosphates and carbon in an iron pot The phosphates were made by dissolving bones in strong acids and evaporating the solution 

Phosphorus is made now by heating calcium phosphate carbon and silicon dioxide in an electric arc furnace The heat of the electric arc melts the mixture of materials and phosphorus gas is given off It is absorbed under water This makes white phosphorus

White phosphorus is used in incendiary weapons and smoke grenades It is also used to make organic compounds that have phosphorus in them Phosphorus is used to dope semiconductors Phosphorus is used to remove oxygen from copper It is also used in making alloys Red phosphorus is used in matches and flares

Phosphorus compounds are used for fertilizers soft drinks toothpaste and detergents Most of these are phosphates Phosphides can be used to kill rodents

White phosphorus is very dangerous It is very toxic and ignites easily burning with a very hot flame Red phosphorus is much safer Some phosphorus compounds are toxic but the common phosphates are not toxic

Franklin Pierce was born on November 23 1804 in Hillsborough New Hampshire He attended school at Hillsborough Center but then moved to Hancock Academy in Hancock at the age of 11 After attending school there for five years he was transferred to Francetown in the spring of 1820 After he entered he felt homesick and returned home Consequently his father then put him in a wagon drove him half way back to school and left him on the roadside without saying a word Franklin walked the seven remaining miles back to school Later that year he was transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy to prepare for college That fall he was sent to Bowdoin College in Brunswick Maine While he was there Franklin Pierce participated in literary political and debating clubs During his second year there his grades were the lowest in his class but he was able to improve them and graduated with the rank of third best in his class

Once finished with college he went to law school in Northampton Massachusetts Pierce was admitted to the bar and began law practice in Concord New Hampshire in 1827 Franklin Pierce rose to a central position in the Democratic party of New Hampshire and was elected to the lower house in New Hampshires General Court in 1828 Pierce served in the State House from 1829 to 1833 and also served as Speaker from 1832 to 1833 Then in 1832 Franklin was elected Democrat to the 23rd and 24th of Congress from March 4 1833 to March 4 1837 At 27 years of age Pierce was the youngest US Representative at that time In 1836 he was elected by the New Hampshire General Court as a Democrat to the US Senate serving from March 4 1837 to February 28 1842 After serving in the Senate Pierce went back to Concord to resume law practice He then was US Attorney from 1845 to 1847 for the district of New Hampshire though he declined Democratic nomination for Governor of New Hampshire and refused the appointment as General of the United States

On November 19 1834 Franklin Pierce married Jane Means Appleton They had three children all of which died in childhood Franklin Pierce Jr died only three days after birth and Frank Robert Pierce died at four years of age from epidemic typhus just two months before his inauguration Franklin Pierce and his family boarded a train bound for Boston Shortly after their derailed car started to roll down an embankment Franklin and Jane survived merely shaken up but saw their 11 year old son Benjamin get crushed to death Jane Pierce thought the train accident was a divine punishment for Franklins pursuit and acceptance of high office

Franklin Pierce served as President from March 4 1853 to March 4 1857 He was the first President to affirm his oath of office instead of swearing it So rather than placing his hands on the Bible Franklin Pierce placed his hands on a law book He was also the first President to recite his inaugural address from memory Surprisingly Franklin Pierce selected men of different opinions for his Cabinet Many people expected a diverse group to break up quickly but the Cabinet stayed together for Pierces four year term

Franklin Pierces toughest challenge as President was the passage of the Kansas Nebraska Act in 1854 This act repealed the Missouri Compromise and in the west reopened the question of slavery These and more triggered a series of events known as Bleeding Kansas Pro slavery Border Ruffians mostly from Missouri illegally voted in a government Pierce recognized this and called the Topeka Constitution set up by Free Staters as an act of rebellion Overall Franklin Pierce is ranked among the least effective Presidents of the United States as he was unable to steer a steady prudent course

After losing the Democratic reelection in 1856 Pierce retired with his wife Franklin Pierce died in Concord New Hampshire on October 8th 1869 449am at the age of 64 He was buried in Old North Cemetery in Concord

The Ottoman Empire lasted from 1299 to 1923 It was centered around the Middle East and western portions of lands around the Mediterranean Sea The empire was created by Ottoman Turks and was most powerful around 1400 to 1600 when it controlled trade and politics in Europe Asia and Africa The empires capitals were firstly Bursa secondly Edirne and finally Istanbul In later years the Ottoman Empire began to weaken and became known as the sick man of Europe in the latter part of the 19th century

In the early years of the empire shahzadahs who were the sons of the Sultan used to be sent to Sanjaks to have experience and to later govern This was because they were candidates for the Sultanate and Khaliphate After Ahmed this system changed In the new system the Sultan would keep all his male relatives locked in a small apartment called a kafes where they would never be able to see the outside world and would therefore be unable to take power from him Often a new Sultan would simply have his male relatives killed a simpler solution since it removed competition for the Sultanate and prevented rebel movements However the women in his harem often sought greater status and influence and the Sultans mother might become the most powerful political force in the Empire because each mother in the harem would try to make her own son the next Sultan since they knew he would probably be killed if he was not The Sultans quickly lost their ability to govern far away territories well and all the peoples living in the Empire were soon governing themselves under their own laws By its end the Ottoman Empire grew so worn out and corrupt that it was ready to collapse

Strategic bombing is a military strategy used to destroy the enemies economic ability to fight a war It is an attack from the air Strategic bombing missions usually attack targets such as factories railroads oil refineries and cities Tactical bombing missions would attack targets such as military bases command and control facilities airfields and ammunition dumps

The United States Air Force over the years have used bombers as strategic bombers role Strategic bombers are bombers used to bomb cities and camps used by the opposing force

Strategic bombing was an idea first thought up in World War I It was used by the German Air Force They bombed London using Gotha bombers Later Gothas could carry over a ton of bombs The idea first came to the United States by Colonel Billy Mitchell He had new ideas on the strategic and tactical air war The first USAAF strategic bomber was the B 17 Flying Fortresse

After World War II the Strategic Air Command became located at Omaha Nebraska at Offutt Air Force Base There was a full cadre of generals located there who participated in many of the missions of the Looking Glass a KC 135 air tanker which was gutted and refitted with state of the art electronics which would take over in case the president was killed in wartime The plane had several generals on board to assume wartime duties The red telephone was an instant connection to the president at the white house The plane flew 247 three planes took off a day in overlapping flights to provide this level of coverage Since the end of the cold war the presidentcongresssenate decommissioned this flight however the Strategic Air Command still maintains the main facility at Offutt AFB

Edsel was a make of car and a new car making division introduced by the Ford Motor Company on September 4 1957 The company called that day E Day It was named after Henry Fords son Edsel Ford The Edsel was also one of the biggest failures in history It was sold for only three years ending in 1960

Ford planned to move their Lincoln brand upmarket and put another make in beneath it Design of the Edsel began in 1955 under the name E car which stood for Experimental car 

Edsel produced four models their first year the 1958 model year These were the large Citation and Corsair and the smaller easier to buy Pacer and Ranger

These were the different body styles offered

The Bermuda Villager and Roundup were station wagons based on the two smaller Edsel models They were basically the same as the 1957 59 Ford wagons

63110 Edsels sold the first year which was the second largest car launch for any brand in history Only the Plymouth introduction in 1928 was better but still not as many cars as Ford hoped would sell

There were only 2 Edsels in 1959 the Ranger and the Corsair Only 44891 cars were sold in that model year 

Only the Ranger and Villager were produced in 1960 These were almost exactly like the 1960 Ford cars Only 2848 cars were built before the Edsel Motor Division was closed on November 19 1959

Edsels failure is very famous because it failed after Ford put US400000000 into its development It had many innovations which are still in use today including brakes which adjusted themselves and a very powerful V 8 engine called the FE series that would be used for many years in later Fords Also the car did not live up to all of the promises in the advertisements before it was released Some people blamed the look of the new car because of its very unusual grille shaped like a horses collar One famous quote from an auto writer said that the Edsel looked like an Oldsmobile sucking on a lemon Quality of the Edsel was a problem as well Even the name was a problem to some buyers Worst of all the US was entering a period of recession All car sales were down 

Many drivers did not like having the automatic transmission as push buttons mounted on the steering wheel hub Since this was the place the horn was normally found drivers ended up shifting gears instead of honking the horn 

The planned 1960 Edsel Comet compact car was relabeled Mercury Comet and sold more cars in its first year than all models of Edsel ever produced 

Fewer than 6000 Edsels survive and today they are considered collectors items with convertibles sometimes selling for over US20000 if in good condition As usual with classics hardtop models are worth considerably less station wagons less than that and sedans least of all It is possible to get a very good 1959 sedan for about US30003500

1000 of the Gregorian Calendar was the last year of the 10th century as well as the last year of the first millennium of the Christian era ending on December 31 According to the then used Julian Calendar AD 1000 was a leap year starting on Monday In the Gregorian Calendar the year would have been a common year starting on Wednesday

It is one of only seven years to use just one Roman numeral The seven are 1 AD 5 AD 10 AD 50 AD 100 AD 500 AD and 1000 AD

Neutrons along with protons and electrons make up an atom Neutrons are found in the nucleus of an atom along with protons Unlike protons which have a positive charge or electrons which have a negative charge neutrons have no charge or neutral charge

Neutrons were discovered by the British scientist James Chadwick in 1932 Atoms were fired at a thin pane of beryllium Particles emerged and had no charge and he named these neutrons

Neutrons have a mass of 1675 10 24g which is a little heavier than the proton Neutrons are 1839 times heavier than electrons Neutrons are made up of two down quarks and one up quark Quarks are held together by gluons

Like all Hadrons Neutrons are made of quarks A neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark One up quark has a charge of 23 and the two down quarks each have a charge of 13 The fact that these charges cancel out is why Neutrons have a neutral charge

Neutrons can be found in almost all atoms alongside protons and electrons The number of them in the atom does not change the element unlike protons However it does change some characteristics of the element or ore The number of them in an atom determines what isotope this compound is 

LiveJournal is a website on which Internet users can keep a blog It is also the name of the software that was designed to run it LiveJournal is different from some other blogging sites because a user can interact with friends in certain ways that are unique to the website It is based in San Francisco California

LiveJournal was started in 1999 by Brad Fitzpatrick as a way of keeping his high school friends updated on his activities In January 2005 a blogging software company called Six Apart bought Danga Interactive the company that was owned by Fitzpatrick which operates LiveJournal

LiveJournal has a service called a friends list which makes the site a way to socialise with friends and other people even though it is a blog service too

LiveJournal lets users change their accounts in several ways A programming language called S2 can help users make their blogs look different Users may upload small pictures called userpics which appear next to the username People can pay to get more features like extra userpics the ability to record their voices into a post the ability to make polls and better layouts

Each user also has a User Info page which may contain contact information a biography of the user and lists of friends interests communities and even schools the user had attended

Currently LiveJournal has five kinds of accounts About 95 of all LiveJournal users use a non paid account People can pay for their accounts and get more features or they can get a sponsored account which is free and has more features but has advertisements Early adopters are the accounts of people who signed up for LiveJournal back in 1999 or 2000 There are also permanent accounts Most people can not get a permanent account LiveJournal only sells them sometimes and they may not sell them again

RNA is an acronym for ribonucleic acid a nucleic acid Many different kinds are now known

The main function of RNA is to carry information of amino acid sequence from the genes to where proteins are assembled on ribosomes in the cytoplasm This is done by messenger RNA The sequence of base pairs is transcribed from DNA by an enzyme called RNA polymerase and is reformed in the mRNA Then the mRNA moves from the nucleus to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm to form proteins The mRNA translates the sequence of base pairs into a sequence of amino acids to form proteins This process is called translation

RNA is physically different to DNA DNA contains two intercoiled strands whereas mRNA only contains one single strand RNA also contains different bases to DNA It contains Adenine Guanine Cytosine Uracil

The first three bases are also found in DNA but Uracil replaces Thymine as a complement to Adenine

RNA also contains ribose as opposed to deoxyribose found in DNA These differences result in RNA being chemically more reactive than DNA This makes it the more suitable molecule to take part in cell reactions

RNA is the carrier of genetic information in certain viruses especially the retroviruses like the HIV virus This is the only exception to the general rule that DNA is the hereditary substance

mRNA or messenger RNA is the complement strand of DNA A single strand of DNA is a blueprint for mRNA which is transcribed from that DNA strand DNA does not leave the nucleus for various reasons DNA is a very long molecule and is bound in with proteins called histones in the chromosomes mRNA on the other hand is able to move and to react with various cell enzymes Once transcribed the mRNA leaves the nucleus and is attached to tRNA which attached to the ribosomes

Two kinds of non coding RNAs help in the process of building proteins in the cell They transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA

Transfer RNA is a short molecule of about 80 nucleotides which carries a specific amino acid to the polypeptide chain at a ribosome Each one has a site for the amino acid to attach and an anti codon to match the codon on the mRNA For example codons UUU or UUC code for the amino acid Phenylalanine

Ribosomal RNA is the catalytic component of the ribosomes Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules 18S 58S 28S and 5S rRNA Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the nucleolus and one is synthesized elsewhere In the cytoplasm ribosomal RNA and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome The ribosome binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis Several ribosomes may be attached to a single mRNA at any time rRNA is extremely abundant and makes up 80 of the 10 mgml RNA found in a typical eukaryotic cytoplasm

There are a number of RNAs which regulate genes that is they regulate the rate at which genes are transcribed or translated 

Micro RNAs act by joining an enzyme and blocking mRNA or speeding its breakdown This is called RNA interference

Small interfering RNAs interfere with the expression of a specific gene They are quite small double stranded molecules Their discovery has caused a surge in biomedical research and drug development

Figure skating is both an art and a sport in which people skate around on ice doing jumps and spins It is done at the Winter Olympics and it has its own world championships

In figure skating sometimes women or men skate alone or they skate in couples Couples dancing includes pairs and ice dancing Pairs skating has jumps and sometimes the man lifts the woman in the air These things are not done in ice dancing In ice dancing the woman must be held in the mans arm Another kind of figure skating is synchronized skating done in groups

The first ever figure skating club was started in 1742 in Edinburgh Scotland World Championships began in 1896

Rottweilers are large muscular dogs Their fur is mostly black with brown on the legs and face They are excellent guard dogs as well as herding and companion dogs

Dogs are pack animals When they feel threatened they will defend themselves They will also protect other members of the pack to a certain extent How they defend themselves and how close they feel to the rest of the pack depends on the dog race and on the how they were raised Since dogs judge dangerous situations differently they should not be left unattended near a place where people are arguing They may also judge unattended moves of a child as an attack Therefore dogs should not be left alone near children

When the Rottweilers owners are not advanced problems arise Sometimes humans mostly children are attacked by dogs These attacks are a result of unresponsible owners Rottweilers are very intelligent and need equally smart handlers to raise them 

In some areas breeding certain dogs has been restricted or forbidden

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J K Rowling is the second novel in the Harry Potter series of books A movie of the book was released in 2002 

About the story This article tells about the beginning of the story It does not contain spoilers of the main adventures 

In Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone JK Rowling has already set the scene for the Harry Potter series But just to make sure that the reader understands Rowling gives brief explanations of the important things that happened in the first book The reader is told that Harry Potter is an orphan that he is a wizard and that he lives with an aunt uncle and cousin who do not love him The reader also discovers that magic people call non magic people Muggles Harrys Aunt Petunia Uncle Vernon and Cousin Dudley are Muggles So are the parents of one of Harrys best friends Hermione Granger a very clever young witch 

Near the beginning of the book Rowling introduces the reader to a famous old wizarding family the Weasleys Harry who has never had brothers and sisters is a little bit overwhelmed when he finds himself staying in the noisy messy Weasley household called The Burrow His good friend Ron is the youngest of six boys and has a younger sister Ginny who has a crush on Harry and who becomes important in this story 

Mr Weasley works for the Department of Magic He is fascinated by Muggles and the way that they manage to live without magic Mr Weasley has never used a telephone or a computer It is his job to prevent wizards from illegally magicking Muggle objects But he does not always do his job in the way the Department would like In fact he drives his family to catch the train in a magical Ford Anglia A feature of the books is the school train called the Hogwarts Express which leaves Paddington Station in London from Platform 9 34 But because of strange happenings Harry and Ron miss the train to school 

In the first book of the series the reader discovers that there are many magical beings in the world such as giants trolls centaurs and unicorns In the second book Rowling introduces another type of magical being the House Elf A House Elf is bound to a family whom it must serve The House Elves are very honourable Usually they would never do anything to upset their owners But they have minds of their own Early in the book a House Elf called Dobby comes to Harry and tells him that he must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Dobbys behaviour is so very weird that Harry does not know what to think Because Dobby comes from a different race to the human Magicians he lives by a different set of rules Dobby is another important character in this book 

Harry and Ron go to school very late and in disgrace When they arrive they have a very nasty adventure with another sort of magical thing an enchanted tree This enchanted tree is to be very important in a later story Joanne Rowling has a clever way of introducing the reader in one book to an idea or a magic spell or a person or object that will later be very important in another book The reader is immediately reminded of what a horrible nasty person Professor Snape the Master of Potions is He is so nasty to Ron and Harry that Professor McGonagal who is the head of their House has to tell him to mind his own business Through the stories Professor Snape often has to be reminded not to stick his long nose into things that are not his business The reader never knows whether he can be trusted or not Professor Dumbledore the Headmaster trusts him but Dumbledore trusts almost everybody 

Harry has not been back at school very long before it becomes clear that everybody inside the school is in danger One by one students and even the caretakers cat are affected by a strange and frightening spell As everyone becomes more and more frightened they start to be suspicious of other people 

In the first book Harry has a serious problem of not telling the truth and not trusting Professor Dumbledore with the things that he discovers In this book when Harry starts hearing a strange voice he should go to the Professor straight away but he does not He has not yet learnt to be trusting Luckily he has listened to a really good bit of advice from the old Professor that help will come to him if he asks for it

A personal computer is a small computer made more common by a system developed by a company called IBM PCs usually operate using a system of software known as Windows by a company called Microsoft Corporation PCs made by a company called Apple Inc operate using their own system of software called Mac OS X There is also a free set of software for everybody to get called Linux Most people use Ubuntu Linux because it is easy to use

A computer user usually works with a mouse and keyboard to interact with the computer and looks at information through a monitor often a flat LCD screen or a CRT much like those used in most televisions

PCs usually use processors of brands such as Intel and AMD Sometimes they may have two processors

They have a memory or RAM for moving information quickly to and from the processor a hard drive for holding the data after a computer has been turned off and usually a floppy drive and a CD ROM drive for reading and writing data Flash drives and DVD drives may also be used to read and store data Computers often have a modem which sends and receives data over a phone line or will use a network to do the same Computers also have spaces for serial devices such as joysticks and a fast port called a USB port

Computers may be used for work including doing math quickly or keeping records communicating with online message systems and e mail with people across the world and fun such as by playing computer games

MS DOS is a computer operating system by Microsoft Corporation It stands for Microsoft Disk Operating System and came from an operating system Microsoft bought called QDOS or the Quick and Dirty Operating System It was popularly used in PCs before an operating system called Microsoft Windows came out and still is in some places today OS2 was originally made by a joint agreement with companies that are called Microsoft and IBM OS2 was maintained by IBM until 2006 OS2 was supposed to replace MS DOS but that replacement did not succeed MS DOS was the framework behind Windows operating systems until an operating system known as Windows XP

MS DOS is a text based operating system meaning that a user works with a keyboard to input data and receives output in plain text Later on MS DOS often had programs using a mouse and graphics to make work more simple and quick It is called a disk operating system because it was originally made to be loaded into a computers memory with a floppy disk each time the computer is started up

A search service helps a computer user find information by looking through web pages for the text the user wants to find the software that does this is known as a search engine Google Yahoo MSN Search and Ask Jeeves are popular search services Some older services include Webcrawler Lycos and Alta Vista

A search service may also include a portal with news games and more information besides a search engine Yahoo has a popular portal and MSN Search is part of the MSN portal while Google has a simple design on its front page

A disk operating system will load from a floppy disk each time a computer starts and will access that disk for software to complete operations MS DOS is probably the most well known DOS and was purchased by Microsoft Corporation from a system known as QDOS As operating systems became more complicated and took up more space they began to be permanently installed on hard drives which are faster and more reliable than floppy disks and can store more data This was encouraged by a steady drop in hard drive prices

DOSes are usually text based and without graphics to save space on a floppy disk Although DOSes have mostly been replaced by Windows Macintosh and Linux systems among others they are still in use in some places mostly on older computers This may be because of a lack of money the need to use software which still runs on a DOS system nostalgia for an older operating system or the belief that text based systems are more efficient

Although GUIs are more popular in times of emergency or when one needs to install special software a boot disk allows a user to start his computer into a DOS

An Internet service provider or ISP usually for a monthly subscription fee will allow a user to connect to the Internet Some ISPs directly put their users on the Internet while others will send a connection through its or a different companys servers which is slightly slower

ISPs provide different services Usually they give space for electronic mail and a website The type of Internet service is different too and may be dial up DSL through fiber optic wires through a cable TV connection wireless or even satellite usually in remote areas Dial up is the slowest service while a direct fiber optic connection is usually the fastest

All Internet connections require a modem which takes in and sends out data by converting binary data to an audio sound into pulses of light and in other ways Some modems are as small as a credit card some are put directly inside a computer and some are in boxes outside the computer

It was bought by Lord Stanley the Governor General of Canada in 1892 for 50 The first team to win it was the Montreal AAA in 1893 Other teams could challenge for it By 1915 it was awarded on a yearly basis

The names of players and others such as coaches are put on the cup every year As a result the NHL had to make the cup bigger by adding layers to the bottom When the first cup was full of names they made a copy of it which is now what is awarded

Today there are 30 teams in the NHL They play 82 games per year and then 16 teams make the playoffs These teams play best of seven series until there is only one champion

According to Joseph Smiths own story when he was 17 years old he was visited by an angel named Moroni Moroni told him about a really old book written upon Golden Plates It was buried in a hill A few years later Joseph says that he received those plates and translated them into the book that today is call The Book of Mormon He instructed a man named Martin Harris to write down the words that he read out of his hat He claimed that he would put seer stones into the hat with the golden plates and the letters would pop out at him and change to English Harris took home the pages and told his wife all about what had happened His wife did not believe him and told him to test Joseph the next day Marvin went to Joseph the next day and said he had lost the pages but would be willing to recopy them This way if Joseph was lying the new book would be different Joseph said he needed to pray alone When he returned he informed Marvin that God was very angry at him and would never let him translate from that plate again Instead he had to translate from another plate which nobody but Joseph was allowed to see Joseph claimed that this one had the same story but was worded different From this translation the Book of Mormon was written

On April 6 1830 he started The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints It is often called the Mormon Church Joseph Smith said that God wanted him to be a prophet and teach other people the things that he learned from God Thousands of people joined this church which still exists today

Bats are mammals in the order Chiroptera They are the only mammals that can fly Other mammals like flying squirrels or flying possum can glide but not fly 

Bats are the second largest order of mammals there are more than 1100 species of bats This means that 20 of all known mammal species one in five are bats 

About seventy percent of bats are insectivores Most of the rest are frugivores A few species suck blood and some large ones are carnivorous 

The phylogenetic relationships of the different groups of bats have been the subject of much debate The traditional subdivision between Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera reflects the view that these groups of bats have evolved independently of each other for a long time from a common ancestor which was already capable of flight 

The hypothesis was that flight only evolved once in mammals Most molecular biological evidence supports the view that bats form a single or monophyletic group

An interesting thing about bats is that even though they can see with their eyes they also use their ears to help them see in the dark Because of this they can fly into very dark places where no eye could see This way of seeing is called echolocation Basically echolocation means they use echoes to find where things are

Echolocation is a lot like sonar that submarines and ships use to find things underwater This is how it works when a bat flies it makes lots of sounds We can not hear these sounds but bats can hear them Scientists have instruments to measure them

When a bat makes its noises the sound waves move away from the bat If they hit something they bounce back to the bat If nothing bounces back the bat knows there its okay to fly forward They use this echolocation to catch their food like butterflies or dragonflies When a bat begins its nightly exploration it usually sends out about 10 calls per second but when they get an echo from something good to eat the calls increase up to 200 calls per second This increase of sounds is called a feeding buzz The bat makes a feeding buzz to see all the quick moves of the insect it is trying to catch

Hearing and understanding the echoes that go back to the bat must take a really big amount of complicated structures in the bats brain Because of this many scientists doctors and even the US army study bats carefully The US army spends hundreds of thousands of dollars every year to study echolocation in bats

Bats also have quite good eyesight and can see their prey and where they are flying if its not too dark There are lots of stories about bats flying right into people but this is not true They can see in the light very well and in the dark they can see much better than us because they are nocturnal  that is they are active during the night dusk or dawn So the expression blind as a bat is not very scientific 

Bats fly with their hands In fact the order of bats Chiropetera means hand wings in Latin

Bat and bird wings are different Birds do not have long finger like bones in their wings like bats Birds can not move each of their fingers but bats can Because of this bats can change their direction while flying or fly in any pattern they want this makes it easier to catch their food A bat flies as if they are swimming through the air pushing both wings down and backward

A birds wing has lots of feathers while a bats wing is mostly a stretchy thin skin called a patagium This thin membrane of skin stretches between each finger bone connects to the bats ankle and connects to the bats tail When a bat folds its wings next to its body the skin broken wikt linkpuckerpuckers up as if its getting smaller

Bats have one claw that sticks out of the top of the wing They use their thumb to climb and crawl Interestingly bats also use their thumbs to clean his ears out

Bats wings have a lot of maneuverability more than a bird in fact but it does not have a lot of lift Because of this they usually have to climb up onto a tree or jump up into the air for the boost before they start flapping their wings

Megabats eat fruit nectar or pollen Most microbats are insectivorous that is they eat insects but some microbats eat small vertebrate animals blood or even other bats

Bats perform a very important role in ecology They pollinate flowers and sometimes spread their seeds Many tropical plants completely depend on bats

Bats mostly live in caves or trees In North America and in Europe they sometimes live in peoples houses without them knowing People can be scared by this and sometimes hurt the bats who mean no harm unless they are Vampire bats They eat blood

Fruit bats are the largest of the bats They eat fruit and can see well There are 166 species all found in the Old World

Vampire bats live in Latin America They are famous for only drinking blood

The Fisherman bat Lives in Latin America and the Caribbean It swoops low over water and grabs small fish with its claws

The bumblebee bat from Thailand is the worlds smallest bat and is also one of the worlds smallest mammals Adults grow to a length of 29 33mm and weigh 2 grams 

The biggest known bat is the Giant golden crowned flying fox It has a wing span of 15m and weighs approximately 12 kg

In the United Kingdom all bats are protected by law and even disturbing a bat or its roost can be punished with a heavy fine

Austin Texas is the summer home to North Americas largest urban bat colony an estimated 1500000 Mexican free tailed bats who eat an estimated 10 to 30 tons of insects each night and attract 100000 tourists each year

In Sarawak Malaysia bats are protected species but the large naked bat and greater nectar bat are eaten by the local communities

In the West Bats are associated with vampires who are said to be able to change into bats Bats are also a symbol of ghosts death and disease However bats are said to be lucky in some European countries such as Poland

The bat is used in fiction by both villains like dracula and heroes like Batman Kenneth Oppel wrote a series of novels beginning with Silverwing which feature bats as good characters

An old wives tale says that bats will entangle themselves in peoples hair This is untrue as bats can detect even a single hair and fly around it

Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra was a Spanish writer His most famous book was Don Quijote de la Mancha It is considered the first modern novel It has been published in 65 countries and has been discussed by critics since the 17th century His work is considered among the most important in all of literature He is sometimes called The Prince of Wits

Nobody knows for sure the reasons that forced Cervantes to leave Castile Whether he was a student of the same name a sword wielding fugitive from justice or fleeing from a royal warrant of arrest for having wounded a certain Antonio de Sigura in a duel is another mystery In any event in going to Italy Cervantes was doing what many young Spaniards of the time did to further their careers in one way or another Rome would reveal to the young artist its ecclesiastic pomp ritual and majesty In a city teeming with ruins Cervantes could focus his attention on Renaissance art architecture and poetry and on rediscovering antiquity He could find in the ancients a powerful impetus to revive the contemporary world in light of its accomplishments Thus Cervantes continuing desire for Italy as revealed in his later works was in part a desire for a return to an earlier period of the Renaissance

By 1570 Cervantes had enlisted as a soldier in a regiment of the Spanish naval elite corps Infantera de Marina stationed in Naples then a possession of the Spanish crown He was there for about a year before he saw active service In September 1571 Cervantes sailed on board the Marquesa part of the galley fleet of the Holy League Spain the Republic of Venice the Republic of Genoa the Duchy of Savoy the Knights Hospitaller based in Malta and others under the command of King Philip IIs illegitimate half brother John of Austria that defeated the Ottoman fleet on October 7 in the Gulf of Lepanto near Corinth at great cost to both sides Though taken down with fever Cervantes refused to stay below and begged to be allowed to take part in the battle saying that he would rather die for his God and his king than keep under cover He fought bravely on board a vessel and received three gunshot wounds two in the chest and one which rendered his left arm useless In Journey to Parnassus he was to say that he had lost the movement of the left hand for the glory of the right Cervantes always looked back onis conduct in the battle with pride he believed that he had taken part in an event that would shape the course of European history

The fallopian tubes connect the ovaries to the uterus and let the ovum pass into the uterus where they are able to be fertilized by sperm during sexual intercourse or other ways such as artificial insemination There are two Fallopian tubes attached to either side of the uterus

They are named after the 16th century Italian anatomist Gabriele Falloppio The Greek word salpinx means trumpet

There are two Fallopian tubes attached to either side of the end of the uterus Each tube will end near one ovary This place is called the fimbria The Fallopian tubes are not attached to the ovaries but open into the peritoneal cavity

In humans the Fallopian tubes are about 7  14 cm long 

There are four parts of the fallopian tube from the ovary to the uterus

The fallopian tube is made of three layers

The Fallopian tubes can move around the pelvis

When an ovum is ready to be released from the ovary the ovary wall breaks open and the ovum goes into the fallopian tube There it starts moving towards to uterus with the help of liquids and cilia on the inside walls This can take hours or days

If the ovum is fertilized while in the fallopian tube then it sticks to the endometrium which is the beginning of pregnancy

Dave Navarro became the new guitarist after Frusciante Navarro and the other members of Red Hot Chili Peppers did not work together very well The other members asked Navarro to leave the band in 1998 after one album At this time Frusciante had been making albums by himself He was also suffering from a heroin addiction When he was feeling better Flea asked him to join Red Hot Chili Peppers again and Frusciante said yes The bands next album Californication was their most popular so far Red Hot Chili Peppers kept recording and released another album soon afterwards After this the band went on a concert tour around the world While they were doing so they released a best of album After the tour the band recorded and released the album Stadium Arcadium in 2006

Red Hot Chili Peppers were originally called Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem The band was started in 1983 for a single performance They were so popular that they were asked to come back again the next week The first members of the band were Anthony Kiedis Flea Hillel Slovak and Jack Irons They all knew each other from Fairfax High School in Los Angeles

After becoming popular in Los Angeles Red Hot Chili Peppers got a recording contract with record label EMI Irons and Slovak thought Red Hot Chili Peppers was a side project They left just before the first album to work more on their original band What Is This Kiedis and Flea did not think their band was a side project and decided to look for new members They hired guitarist Jack Sherman and drummer Cliff Martinez Andy Gill usually a guitarist was hired to be a producer for the bands first album

Their first album was called The Red Hot Chili Peppers It did not sell many copies but it got the band a small number of dedicated fans Critics such as Robert Christgau liked the album but the tour that came after it did not do well Sherman was fired by the band after the tour and Slovak came back to replace him

Red Hot Chili Peppers hired George Clinton to produce their second album Freaky Styley They released the album in 1985 It was only a little bit more successful than the one before it After the album Martinez was fired from the band After firing him Kiedis said he thought that Martinez had wanted to leave Red Hot Chili Peppers hired another drummer Chuck Biscuits but Irons came back to replace him The band began work with producer Michael Beinhorn on a new album

The album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan was released in 1987 It was the bands most successful so far The album entered the Billboard 200 chart but only at number 148 During this time Kiedis and Slovak had problems with drugs Slovak died on June 25 1988 Because of this Irons left the band He said that he did not want to be part of a band where his friends were dying Kiedis and Flea agreed to keep going with the band

After Slovak died and Irons left the band D H Peligro and DeWayne Blackbyrd McKnight joined Red Hot Chili Peppers Neither of these two worked very well with the band so they were replaced Peligro told a friend of his John Frusciante to audition to join the band His audition went well and he joined as guitarist A friend of the band then told them about Chad Smith Smith had a very good audition and joined During the recording of their next album Frusciante argued with Michael Beinhorn the producer Beinhorn wanted Frusciante to play his guitar very loud like heavy metal music but Frusciante did not like this style

Red Hot Chili Peppers next album Mothers Milk became very successful It sold well and songs from it appeared often on radio It also appeared on MTV because the band did a popular cover of Stevie Wonders song Higher Ground The album reached number 52 on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified gold by the RIAA

After Mothers Milk Red Hot Chili Peppers changed their record label to Warner Music The band chose to work with Rick Rubin as their next producer Rubin thought they needed to work somewhere other than a studio so they decided to record their next album in a mansion he owned Smith did not stay in the mansion because he thought it was a haunted house The rest of the band did not leave the house for a month

The name of the new album Blood Sugar Sex Magik was taken from the tenth song on the album It was chosen by Rubin because the band could not agree on a title He chose the name because he thought Blood Sugar Sex Magik was the best song on the album The first single from the album Give It Away won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance It was the bands first Grammy Award Give It Away did well on the music charts It was the bands first song to go to number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart The second single Under the Bridge was the bands most successful song it charted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number two The other singles from the album also did well

The bands success made life difficult for Frusciante who also had a drug addiction He quit the band while they were on tour in May 1992 He was replaced by Arik Marshall Marshal was later replaced by Jesse Tobias The band played at the Lollapalooza festival in 1992 They also appeared on an episode of The Simpsons Neither of the bands new members stayed for long Tobias was replaced in 1993 by Dave Navarro from the band Janes Addiction

Dave Navarro first appeared with the band at the 1994 Woodstock Festival They found it hard to work with him Flea said it was because of the fact that we grew up listening to different music Red Hot Chili Peppers spent three months in Hawaii making a new album and One Hot Minute was released in 1995 Its content was sadder than the bands earlier albums It also sounded more like hard rock than the bands earlier work

During this time Kiedis had troubles with the drug heroin again Navarro also took drugs At one practice session with the band he fell over his amplifier because he was in an over excited condition because he had taken too many drugshe was high Because of this the band asked Navarro to leave They told the media it was mutual because the band members disagreed on the music they liked to make

After leaving Red Hot Chili Peppers Frusciante made some albums by himself He also had an addiction to heroin He was so addicted that he was close to poverty and death at times Frusciante went into a clinic for therapy The quality of his life slowly improved In April 1998 Flea asked Frusciante to join the band again The rest of the band were happy to see him return Kiedis called it the defining moment of the bands career so far

The band were happy to have Frusciante rejoin but it was a while before they began making songs again This was because he had sold all of his guitars for money to buy drugs with It also took him a while to get used to playing music as part of a band again The band released their seventh album Californication in 1999 It had fewer songs based on rap and funk than their previous albums The album focused more on melodic guitar riffs Californication was very popular It sold over 15 million copies Three of the singles on the album Scar Tissue Otherside and Californication reached number one on the Modern Rock Tracks chart

After touring in Spring 2001 Red Hot Chili Peppers began recording a new album The band chose to work with Rubin again They recorded in band members homes Frusciante did a lot more work on recording the new album By the Way than he had done on Californication By the Way was released in 2002 It was the best seller of any album by the band so far It sold over one million copies in the first week in which it could be bought The album was rated very highly on charts Some people thought that the music on By the Way was similar to the music on Californication A review by Blender magazine called it Californication 2 a reprise of their last album However Entertainment Weekly said By the Way was a lot more serious than Californication A review from Stylus Magazine said that Red Hot Chili Peppers showed no broken wikt linkpassionpassion in making the album and that it was stunningly awfulcite webauthorBrett HickmandateSeptember 1 2003 urlhttpwwwstylusmagazinecomreviewsred hot chili peppersby the wayhtmtitleRed Hot Chili Peppers  By the WaypublisherStylus Magazineaccessdate2008 08 22ref

Kangaroos can be dangerous because of their powerful legs They can lean back on their tails to deliver powerful kicks In 2009 a man went to save his dog which had chased a kangaroo into a farm dam The kangaroo was able to hold the dog underwater nearly drowning it The kangaroo gave the man several big kicks before he was able to grab his dog and escape from the dam He needed hospital treatment for his injuries

The word kangaroo is an Australian Aboriginal word from the Guugu Yimidhirr people of north Queensland The word was recorded by Captain James Cook in August 1770 It was the name for the grey kangaroo Macropus robustus Cooks ship the HMS Endeavour had been damaged on coral on the Great Barrier Reef it took seven weeks for the ship to be repaired on the banks of a river now the Endeavour River at the site of the town of Cooktown This gave Cook Joseph Banks and other crew members time to explore the area and the plants and animals The skin and skull of a kangaroo was taken back to England to be put on show In James Boswells book Life of Johnson he describes Dr Samuel Johnson in 1793 hopping around the room to explain to people how a kangaroo moved When Arthur Phillip and the First Fleet arrived in Sydney in 1788 they were surprised that the Aborigines did not know the word kangaroo It took them a while to realize that Aborigines at Sydney spoke a different language to those from Cooktown

There are four species of kangaroos

There are also about 50 other smaller macropods in the macropodidae family

Harriet Tubman was an African American abolitionist humanitarian and Union spy during the American Civil War She escaped from slavery and made 13 plans to help more than 70 slaves escape She used the help of the Underground Railroad The Underground Railroad was a series of houses where slaves could go to as they made their way to the northern United States where they would be free

When she was a child in Maryland Tubman was whipped and beaten by many different masters When she was very young an angry overseer threw a heavy metal weight at another slave which accidentally hit her This hurt her head very badly

Her mother Rit was a cook Her father Ben was a talented woodsman who did the timber work on a plantation They married around 1808 According to court records they had nine children together Linah was born in 1808 Mariah Ritty in 1811 Soph in 1813 Robert in 1816 Minty in 1822 Ben in 1823 Rachel in 1825 Henry in 1830 and Moses in 1832

A driver is a program that lets the operating system communicate with the computer hardware 

Computer parts need a driver because they do not use standard commands Different operating systems also need different drivers a driver written for Linux can not be used by Microsoft Windows 

Many parts of a computer need drivers but the most popular are

Some other parts do not need drivers because they use a kind of standard the operating system recognizes those parts and knows how to use those parts

Using the wrong device driver can prevent hardware from working correctly For example a HP printer will not work with a computer that only has a Canon driver Keeping drivers up to date avoids problems when using new programs with the piece of hardware

A central processing unit is an important part of every computer The CPU sends signals to control the other parts of the computer almost like how a brain controls a body

The CPU is an electronic machine that works on a list of things to do called instructions It reads the list of instructions one instruction at a time and does each one in order A list of instructions that a CPU can read is a computer program A machine that can perform the job of a CPU is often called a Turing machine by mathematicians 

The speed that a CPU works at is measured in Hertz Hz however modern processors run so fast that Gigahertz GHz is used One gigahertz is one billion hertz

Here are some of the basic things a CPU can do

Even very complicated programs can be made by combining many simple instructions like these This is possible because each instruction takes a very short time to happen Many CPUs today can do more than 1 billion instructions in a single second In general the more a CPU can do in a given time the faster it is One way to measure a processors speed is MIPS Flops and CPU clock speed are also ways to measure how much work a processor can do in a certain time 

A CPU is built out of logic gates it has no moving parts The CPU of a computer is connected electronically to other parts of the computer like the video card or the BIOS A computer program can control these peripherals by reading or writing numbers to special places in the computers memory

Some newer processors have Multiple Cores This means that they have many processors built on to the same chip so that they can do more than one thing at once

While the individual cores might be slower than a single core processor all the cores can work together to go faster This means that the GHz might be lower however the overall speed of the processor will be higher

To make an analogy think of cars

The Running of the Bulls is an activity that involves running in front of bulls on a course of a sectioned off area of a towns streets It is done all around Spain but the most famous running of the bulls is in Pamplona In most bull runs the bulls are not killed and they live for a whole season This is a dangerous activity but very exciting Safety varies in some places like Xabia the area is surrounded by cages that people can slip in and out of but the bulls can not

Red shift is a way astronomers use to tell the distance of any object that is very far away in the Universe The red shift is one example of the Doppler effect 

The easiest way to experience the Doppler effect is to listen to a moving train As the train moves towards a person the sound it makes as it comes towards them sounds like it has a higher tone since the frequency of the sound is squeezed together a little bit As the train speeds away the sound gets stretched out and sounds lower in tone The same happens with light when an object that emits light moves very fast An object like a star or a galaxy that is far away and moving toward us will look more blue than it normally does This is called blue shift A star or galaxy moving away from us will look more red than it should which is where red shift got its name since the colors are shifted red

The reason astronomers can tell how far the light gets shifted is because certain chemical elements like the calcium in bones or the oxygen people breathe has a unique fingerprint of light that no other chemical element has They can see what colors of light are coming from a star and see what it is made of Once they know that they check to see the difference between where the fingerprint called spectral lines are actually at and then look at where they are supposed to be When they see that they can tell how far away the star is whether it is moving toward us or away from us and also how fast it is going since the faster it goes the farther the distance the spectral lines are from where they should be

Red shift is important because astronomers used it to figure out that the Universe is expanding

Spectral lines are how scientists tell one element from another by looking at color

In order to understand spectral lines color has to be understood In a rainbow the colors of light go from purple to red Several hundred years ago the famous scientist Issac Newton did an experiment where he showed that even white light from the Sun was made up of all the colors of the rainbow When other scientists following him looked at this rainbow very closely they noticed that there were dark lines breaking up the rainbow where certain shades of colors should be These lines were very small and could only be seen when the rainbow got streched out very far They investigated this further and discovered that certain chemical elements like the hydrogen and helium that make up the Sun absorbed certain frequencies of light where those colors should be like a sponge absorbs water but does not absorb chalk

Soon scientists discovered that when they heated up other chemical elements like calcium and oxygen so hot that they shined with a white light they found similar lines but in different places No two chemical elements had these lines in exactly the same places along the rainbow and they also soon discovered that could be used to be able to tell what stars were made up of in the Universe

The reason the chemical elements can do this is because of the number and places of electrons orbiting around the center of each atom of each chemical element These electrons when light hits them absorb a specific wavelength or color of light and what color they absorb depend on their position around the atom Since each chemical element has a certain number of electrons each chemical element has this unique set of spectral lines

Since each set of spectral lines was unique scientists could also be able to use this in a technique called red shift Red shift is a method astronomers use after they know what a star is made of to tell how fast an object far away in the Universe is moving It also tells them how far away it is

The Pentagon is a large building in Arlington Virginia that is the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense It has five sides and with limestone walls It is in the shape of a pentagon It has seven floors There are 23000 people working in it

The Pentagon is the biggest office building in the world but you can reach any place in the building within 7 minutes

They began building it on September 11 1941 Exactly sixty years later on September 11 2001 it was hit with an airplane by terrorists One hundred eighty four people in the building were killed

The Pentagon is has the most floor area of any building in the world It has a total floor area of 6500000 sq ft Offices are 3700000 sq ft Approximately 23000 military and civilian employees and about 3000 non defense support personnel work in the Pentagon It has five sides five floors above ground two basement levels and five ring corridors per floor with a total of convert175mikmabbron of corridors The Pentagon includes a five acre central plaza which is shaped like a pentagon

The concentric rings are named as A through E E Ring offices are the only ones with outside views and are generally occupied by senior officials Office numbers go clockwise around each of the rings and have two parts a nearest corridor number followed by a bay number so office numbers range from 100 to 1099 These corridors radiate out from the central courtyard with corridor 1 beginning with the Concourses south end Each numbered radial corridor intersects with the corresponding numbered group of offices There are a number of historical displays in the building particularly in the A and E rings

Floors in The Pentagon are lettered B for Basement and M for Mezzanine both of which are below ground level The concourse is located on the second floor at the metro entrance Above ground floors are numbered 1 to 5 Room numbers are given as the floor concentric ring and office number So office 2B315 is on the second floor B ring and nearest to corridor 3 One way to get to this office would be to go to the second floor get to the A ring go to and take corridor 3 and then turn left on ring B to get to bay 15

A person can walk between any two points in less than seven minutes

Just south of the Pentagon are Pentagon City and Crystal City extensive shopping and high density residential districts in Arlington Arlington National Cemetery is to the north The Washington Metro Pentagon station is also located at the Pentagon on the Blue and Yellow Lines The Pentagon is surrounded by the complex Pentagon road network Every day thousands of commuters traveling between Arlington Virginia and Washington DC drive on the roads of the Pentagon Reservation

The Pentagon Athletic Center is a fitness center for military and civilian staff It opened in a separate building on the north side of the Pentagon in 2004 Each year the Pentagon grounds hold the Marine Corps Marathon and the Army Ten Miler running events

The public may take a 60 minute long tour of the building Tourists also visit the Pentagon Memorial that is on the buildings west side

The Beach Boys are a popsurf rock group from Hawthorne California They formed in 1961 and the original members were Brian Wilson his brothers Dennis Wilson and Carl Wilson their cousin Mike Love and close friend Al Jardine David Marks replaced Jardine when he went away to school after Jardines return Marks left the band Bruce Johnston later became a regular band member first replacing Brian Wilson on tour then joining in on recording sessions Many of the bands songs were about life in southern California the beach girls cars and surfing

Their songs include Good Vibrations Fun Fun Fun Help Me Rhonda Wouldnt It Be Nice and God Only Knows Brian Wilson was influenced by people like Burt Bacharach and Phil Spector and started making music like theirs Among critics and fans in most countries the best known Beach Boys album was their eleventh Pet Sounds which featured this kind of music In the United States however Pet Sounds was the first album since their first one to not get a gold certificate in sales and peaked at number ten lower than all but two of their previous albums

A Modem is a piece of computer hardware It is used to communicate between distant computers Two modems one on each computer are required to make a connection and each modem can send and receive data to and from the other modem The word modem stands for modulator  demodulator

Modems are generally classified by the amount of data they can send in a given time normally measured in bits per second Pieces of data are sent from one modem to another modem at a set speed or rate This rate is called the baud rate One baud is one bit per second

There are 3 types of modems internal modems external modems and PC card modems Commonly modems are used to connect to the Internet through telephone service or cable service Slow telephone service is called dial up faster telephone service is called DSL DSL data transfer rates are comparable to cable service transfer rates

A CEA study in 2006 found that dial up Internet access is on a decline in the United States In 2000 dial up Internet connections accounted for 74 of all US residential Internet connections The number of dial up modem users per capita in the US has been more or less mirrored in Canada and Australia for the past 20 years

Dial up modem use in the US dropped to 60 by 2003 and in 2006 stood at 36 Voiceband modems were once the most popular means of Internet access in the US But as more homes adopted faster ways of accessing the Internet the traditional 56K modem is losing popularity

3DO is the name of the video game consoles made by the 3DO company They were released in 1993 and 1994 Its features were very ahead of its time The 3DO was one of the worst selling consoles in history because it was very expensive and other companies had cheaper systems It was also not advertised very well so no one knew about it Some of the best games for it are Alone in the Dark and Myst The 3DO company also wanted to make another console called the M2 but it was never released

The APF M1000 was a video game console made by APF in 1978 The controllers had numbers and a joystick With a joystick the player moves the joystick and uses it to control the action in the game It could only be used on a color TV It came built in with the game Rocket Patrol

Windsor is a city in southern Ontario Canada which is across the Detroit River from the US city of Detroit Michigan Windsor was founded in 1749 by the French It has a population of 208 000

QWERTY refers to a certain typewriter or computer keyboard layout that is commonly used in some English speaking countries The term comes from the fact the first 6 letters of the top row of keys are Q W E R T and Y The QWERTY design was patented by Christopher Sholes in 1874 and sold to E Remington and Sons during the same year

The QWERTY layout was invented by Christopher Sholes the inventor of the first modern typewriter At first the letters on the typewriter were placed alphabetically However when the user of the typewriter learned to type quickly the bars attached to letters became caught in one another making the typist unstick the typebars with his hands A business associate of Christopher named James Densmore gave the idea of splitting up the keys to speed up typing by preventing the typebars from striking the typewriter roller at the same time and sticking together Some people say the QWERTY layout was created to slow down typing speed while others say it worked by separating series of English lettersFileQwertysvgthumbleft300pxA QWERTY keyboard normally used in English speaking countries

QWERTY was made for the English language therefore it has no accent marks People from other countries that used accent marks had problems Depending on the operating system and the application being used accents marks could be accessed eg hold down the Alt key press 1 5 and 6 then release the Alt key to generate a character numbered 156 in some character set Or the Control or Alt key can be used together with a letter In some word processors like Microsoft Word characters with accent marks could be found under a category named Special Characters or something similar

Depending on where the QWERTY keyboard was made the keyboard may look different

The keyboards made in Belgium and France switch the letters Q and W with the letters A and Z They also move the letter M to the right of L These types of keyboards are called AZERTY keyboards

Most belgian keyboards have the AZERTY keyboard layout which is based on QWERTY

Some of the keyboards in the Czech language use QWERTZ keyboards They switch the Z and Y like the German version but it uses to the right of L and next to P The row that normally has numbers has the accents     Instead the person who uses the keyboard has to use the shift key to make numbers

Danish and Norwegian layouts switched  and where Swedish and Finnish the letters and 

Faroese keyboards add and next to L and and next to P

German keyboards add an  to the right of P  and  to the right of L  and switch the Z and Y keys both because Z is a much more common letter than Y in German

Icelandic layouts add to the right of P to the right of L to the right of 0 in the top row and to the rightmost place in the bottom row

Italian typewriter keyboards use a QZERTY layout where Z is swapped with W and M is at the right of L Computers use a QWERTY keyboard with to the right of P and to the right of L

Lithuanian keyboards use a layout known as ERTY where appears in place of Q above A in place of W above S with Q and W being available either on the far right side or by use of the Alt Gr key Depending on the software used Sometimes Lithuanian symbols replace the numbers

Portuguese keyboards maintain the QWERTY layout but add the key  after the L keyThe Spanish version has the letter the 

Romanian keyboards have a QWERTZ layout swapping Y with Z and are added to the right of the letter P while and are added to the right of the letter L replaces the backslash character Changes are also made to the upper number keys the numbers remain the same but some of the symbols are shuffled The most notable change is that hyphen is swapped with slash

Spanish keyboards add and characters to the right of the L instead of the semicolon and colon

Turkish layouts add and to the right of P and to the right of L and to the right of M

A list is a part of a text which has many words separated by commas or a group of words going down the page that may use bullet points or numbers Semi colons are also used sometimes to separate items in a list

These are lists

Antimatter is stuff within the universe that is the equal and opposite of matter It looks just like matter and acts just like matter but cannot touch matter If the matter and the antimatter touch they will destroy each other and turn into energy

Many scientists think that in the first few moments after the Big Bang which created the universe a very long time ago both matter and antimatter were mixing together Since there was just a little bit more matter than antimatter created whatever was left over after most of the matter and antimatter annihilated into energy became the Universe we see today Physicists do not yet know for sure that equal amounts of matter and antimatter were created and because of this they are also wondering where the antimatter went and if any was left over from the beginning of the universe

Because antimatter can make so much energy it can be used for a lot of things such as fuel for going into outer space or in our cars The problem is that antimatter is very very expensive to make and is almost as expensive to store since it cannot touch regular matter It takes several hundred million dollars to make less than one millionth of a gram of antimatter In fact it is the most expensive and rare substance on Earth Since it is so expensive this means that antimatter is not practical to use as a weapon or as an energy source because so little of it is obtainable

Recently however scientists have trapped antimatter for over 16 minutes

It does have a use in medicine because a special kind of scanner called the PET which stands for positron emission tomography uses positrons to go into the human body Doctors can look at the way the positron changes into energy inside a persons body and be able to tell if something is wrong inside a person This kind of machine works differently than an X ray machine or a magnetic resonance imaging machine and can help doctors see things that those other machines cannot see

The Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost is a part of the triune godhead of Christianity 

The Holy Spirit was there from the beginning Genesis 12 says that the Holy Spirit helped create the Earth

It was by the Holy Spirit that Jesus was conceived in Mary

When Jesus had finished his ministry on Earth he told his followers that he would provide another Comforter who would lead them into truth and would be their teacher to tell them things that Jesus had not told them but that they needed to know to continue to live for God 

The second chapter of the book of Acts tells how on the 50th day after Passover and 10 days after Jesus ascended to Heaven Jesus followers were gathered at the feast While they were praying the Holy Spirit came upon them They began to speak in other languages

While most Christians believe that the Holy Spirit is in them from the time they become born again in Pentecostal denominations such as The Assembles of God it is believed that speaking in unknown tongues can still be an expression of the Holy Spirit and that it is proof that a person has received the baptism of the Holy Spirit 

The Internet Protocol is a set of rules for sending information between computers on the Internet Each computer that uses the Internet Protocol has at least one IP address that identifies it to all other devices on the planet just like a person might have a postal address

This set of rules is like a language but in computer science it is a protocol A board of engineers has defined some of those protocols which sit on top of each other On top of the Internet protocol there is the Transmission Control Protocol and the User Datagram Protocol Below it there are protocols of the Network layer like Ethernet

At the moment there are two versions of the Internet Protocol being used One is called IP Version 4 the other one is called IP Version 6

An IP address is a number given to each computer on the internet It is like a postal address or telephone number but for the computer Internet protocol defines how communication from one address to another work

Some computers have the same IP address for a very long time These IP addresses are called static IP addresses Some computers change their IP from time to time These IP addresses are called dynamic IP addresses

With IPv4 each address consists of four numbers called octets They go from 0 to 255 To make an IP address one takes 4 such numbers To translate between an IP address and the name of the computer a system called Domain Name System is used It can translate between the name and the IP Address

An IPv4 address could look something like this

With IPv4 some addresses are reserved for special purposes For example 127001 how the computer a user is working on looks at itself

Also there are special meanings associated with two different ending numbers In general a last number of 0 stands for the network and a last number of 255 stands for all hosts on that network Computers that are on the same local network share 3 of the 4 numbers A computer can be on more than one network It can also have several names

In the early stages of development of the Internet Protocol network administrators interpreted an IP address in two parts network number portion and host number portion The highest order octet in an address was designated the network number and the rest of the bits were called the rest field or host identifier and were used for host numbering within a network This method soon proved inadequate as additional networks developed that were independent from the existing networks already designated by a network number In 1981 the Internet addressing specification was revised with the introduction of classful network architecture

Classful network design allowed for a larger number of individual network assignments The first three bits of the most significant octet of an IP address was defined as the class of the address Three classes were defined for universal unicast addressing Depending on the class derived the network identification was based on octet boundary segments of the entire address Each class used successively additional octets in the network identifier thus reducing the possible number of hosts in the higher order classes

Unfortunately IPv4 does not have enough addresses to cover the demand for all the computers and other internet devices that the world now uses IPv6 was designed as the solution

IP Version 6 uses 16 octets So instead of 4 numbers there are now 16 numbers Also IPv6 addresses are usually written as hexadecimal numbers They are separated by colons so an IPv6 address might look like this

There are two address compression techniques available

Newfoundland and Labrador is a province on the East Coast of Canada and is the farthest east of all Canadian provinces and territories The capital of Newfoundland and Labrador is St Johns In 2001 533800 people lived in Newfoundland and Labrador

Newfoundland is an island while Labrador is within the mainland of Canada and on a border with Quebec

The province of Newfoundland and Labrador was originally called Newfoundland and joined Canada in 1949 becoming the newest province of Canada after being a colony of the United Kingdom Until an agreement was reached in 1927 Quebec also claimed Labrador 

In 2001 the name of Newfoundland changed to its new official name Newfoundland and Labrador while the postal code abbreviation changed from NF to NL The island of Newfoundland and part of Labrador are in a time zone that is a half hour off from any other part of North America

Greenfinch is a kind of small bird There is an European kind of Greenfinch and an Oriental kind of Greenfinch

It nests in trees or bushes laying 3 5 or 3 8 eggs

St Johns is the capital of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador It is also the largest city in the province with 100646 people living there since 2006

There is a large university in St Johns so the city is home to many students

Close to St Johns is Cape Spear the easternmost point in North America

A nest is place animals build to hold their eggs andor provide a place to raise their babies Many times they are made of things like twigs grass mud and leaves or they may simply be a low place in the ground or a hole in a tree rock or building

Some mammals some fish and some reptiles also build nests

This use of the term egg deals with the fertilised ovum the zygote and what surrounds it during its development

Some animals mostly mammals keep the zygote inside their body where the embryo grows until it is ready to be born Other animals lay a protective egg outside the mother The egg nourishes and protects the embryo When the baby animal is ready it hatches that means it comes out of the egg

Reptiles birds and monotremes lay cleidoic eggs like a chickens egg Other mammals form similar eggs but without the shell They develop internally Fish amphibia insects and arachnids lay simpler eggs in greater numbers but with much less protection and nourishment

The ostrich has the largest eggs of all currently living animals Eggs mostly bird eggs are often eaten as food The shell of an egg is a hard calcareous material The shell of an ostrich egg can support the weight of a fully grown human

An abacus is a very old tool used for arithmetic It is still used in some parts of the world Sometimes blind people will use an abacus because they can feel the numbers easily The most common abacuses work by moving beads on rods

Abacuses can do addition subtraction multiplication division and people can use them to find the square root of whole numbers Expert or very good abacus users can sometimes do math quicker than basic calculators There is a common Chinese abacus This abacus is split into two kinds of basic rows the top is for the 5s and the bottom is for the ones There are one or two beads in the top rows and four or five beads in the bottom ones For example 8 is one bead on top and 3 below because 5 3 8 Every column represents a different digit 

An accordion is a musical instrument that has keys similar to a piano but is small enough for a person to hold and makes sounds using air pushed and pulled through reeds using a bellows The accordion can also have buttons instead of keys The 6 plus 6 system with three rows has the same fingering in all twelve scales

The accordion was invented in 1822 in Germany by Friedrich Buschmann

The Amiga CD32 was a game console made by Commodore International It was based on the A1200 computer It was basically a computer without the computers main parts It could support other things that could make it into a computer It had CD rom drive and could play CD32 games They did not make many CD32 games

It did not do very well

The GX4000 was a console made by Amstrad in 1990 At first it was successful But it di not continue its early success The GX4000 games could be used with other Amstrad computers Only 40 games were made for it Soon it disappeared into the mist of history These days it is very rare to see one that is still in working condition

ApeXtreme is a console created by Apex Digital Inc It was released January 9 2004

It can do many things like play computer games DVDs CDs VCDs and use the Internet

What it can do

New Years Day is a holiday in many countries It was created to welcome the New Year In the United States and most other countries in the world New Years Day is January 1 The New Year is an event that happens when a culture celebrates the end of one year and the beginning of the next Cultures that measure yearly calendars all have New Year celebrations

The ancient Roman calendar had only ten months It started the year on 1 March This is still shown in the names of some months which come from Latin September October November December 

Around 713 BC the months of January and February were added to the year They were added by the second king Numa Pompilius along with the leap month Intercalaris The year used in dates was the consular year It began on the day when consuls first entered office It was changed by law to 15 March in 222 BC It was moved to 1 January in 153 BC In 45 BC Julius Caesar created the Julian calendar This calendar dropped Intercalaris 1 January was kept as the first day of the new year

 Early Christmas  In Christmas Style dating the new year started on 25 December This was used in Germany and England until the thirteenth century and in Spain from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century 

In Annunciation Style dating the new year started on 25 March the feast of the Annunciation This was used in many parts of Europe in the Middle Ages The style was started by Dionysius Exiguus in AD 525 Annunciation Style was used in the Kingdom of Great Britain until January 1 1752 except Scotland which changed to Circumcision Style dating on 1 January 1600 The rest of Great Britain changed to Circumcision Style on the 1 January after the change in Great Britain from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar on 314 September 1752

Asthma attacks are treated with rescue medication inhalers that the person breathes into their lungs Asthma attacks are not always easy to spot children are especially hard to tell how bad the asthma attack is  Things to pay attention to are things like 

Asthma attacks can be caused by exercise pets allergies or many other triggers  Asthma attacks can be dangerous Doctors call the worst attacks status asthmaticus and usually admit the person to a special room in a hospital

A trigger is anything that causes asthma to get worse Asthma is not something that ever goes away so the lungs are always irritated and sensitive Triggers cause the lungs to tighten Common triggers are things like 

The way to avoid triggers is to get rid of them if possible

Asthma can be controlled most often by avoiding contact with triggers and by using certain drugs Most asthma sufferers carry special medicines around with them These are called inhalers The medicine inside the inhaler opens the tubes that go to the lungs The inhaler is usually used to prevent an asthma attack or to stop an attack that is already happening

Rescue medicine A rescue medicine is an inhaler that is used if a person thinks they are having an asthma attack

Controller medicine A controller medicine is a medicine in either a pill or an inhaler taken every day to prevent asthma attacks

Hospitals have other options they can use in an emergency when the regular treatments dont work

Bochum is a city in the Ruhr area of the state of North Rhine Westphalia in Germany It is part of the Arnsberg Government Region

Bochum has about 380000 inhabitants The city is formed by the traditional industry of coal mining in the Ruhr area but today there is no mining in Bochum anymore

Today the most important institution in Bochum is the Ruhr University Bochum one of the biggest German universities It has an extremely wide spectrum of subjects beginning with mathematics and science social sciences economy engineering laws philosophy historical subjects theology medicine and languages even including Chinese and Polish

Bochum has a rich cultural life and its theatre is one of the most prominent in Germany Next to Bochum are the cities Essen and Hattingen

Progressive rock is a type of rock music with complicated musical technique and composition This means that the tempo time signature and style can change many times in a single song 

Most normal rock songs follow a very simple pattern in the way they are arranged This pattern is a verse followed by a chorus then a different verse and then the same chorus Progressive rock is more complicated than this and can require more skill to play

Progressive rock was first made in the late 1960s but became most popular in the 1970s It continues to be popular today too Progressive rock began in England and spread throughout Europe It remains most popular in Europe but there are several notable American and Canadian progressive rock bands as well This genre was influenced by classical music and jazz fusion Over the years different sub genres of progressive rock have been created such as symphonic rock art rock math rock and progressive metal

Progressive rock artists wished to create music that was not within the limitations of popular rock and pop music They wished to progress rock to the complexity of jazz and classical music and create a more serious complex and sophisticated type of rock music Some progressive rock bands include influences from folk music world music and jazz or jazz fusion

Progressive rock bands write and play songs that change very much during each song Regular rock songs have verses and a chorus but progressive songs can have many different sections For example instead of having verses and choruses progressive rock songs may have many different musical themes solos and musical moods A typical progressive song might have a form such as Introduction Verse Chorus instrumental section New verse New choir Instrumental section Ending That is why many progressive rock songs are not played on the radio very often

Important progressive rock bands from the 1970s were Jethro Tull Yes Genesis Pink Floyd Emerson Lake Palmer Rush Gentle Giant Van der Graaf Generator and King Crimson

Progressive rock is difficult to define because progressive rock bands are often play different types of progressive rock music that sound different There are some common elements that are in most progressive rock band music such as long complex songs unusual time signatures unusual instruments or ways of using them and use of improvisation which means making up or inventing music while playing on stage

San Juan is the capital city of Puerto Rico The citys population is 433733 It is the 42nd largest city and the oldest European settlement in United States territory Today San Juan is Puerto Ricos most important seaport

San Juan was founded in 1521 It was named after San Juan Bautista or St John the Baptist San Juan is also known as La Ciudad Amurallada This means the walled city San Juan has many old buildings still standing today Many Spanish explorers came during the European Exploration period and built forts churches and other historical buildings An example of a very old fort is La Fortaleza It is also known as Palacio de Santa Catalina In the sixteenth century it was a Spanish fortress against Caribs These were the people native to the Caribbean islands and Central America Another old building is the oldest residence in Old San Juan Casas de los Contrasfuertes

Kashmir also known as Cashmere is a region in South central Asia The term Kashmir historically was described as the valley just to the south of the western end of the Himalayan mountain range Today Kashmir refers to a much larger area that includes the regions of Kashmir Valley Jammu region and Ladakh The main Valley of Kashmir is a low fertile area surrounded by mountains and fed by many rivers People like it for its natural beauty and simple lifestyle Kashmir is also a Disputed Territory Pakistan India and China hold parts of this region

The economy of the region is focused on agriculture People grow rice there In the Indian part they also grow corn such as wheat and barley Its climate is different from that of most of the Indian subcontinent It is milder Therefore crops like artichoke cauliflower cabbage and certain kinds of beans are also grown 

Cashmere wool is well known almost anywhere in the world Cashmere wool is wool from Cashmere goats Because of conflicts over the territory however most Cashmere wool no longer comes from Kashmir

Kashmir is home to the finest saffron in the world

Tourism has been important in Kashmir for many years Many people call the region Paradise on Earth Tourists visit Kashmir from all over the world irrespective of nationality and religion In spite of a drop in footfalls due to terrorism in the last decade Kashmir still remains one of the most sought after tourist destinations

What is known as the Kashmir conflict has existed since India and Pakistan became independent states On October 20 1947 tribesmen backed by Pakistan invaded Kashmir The Maharaja of Jammu Kashmir initially fought back but on 27 October appealed for assistance to the Governor General Louis Mountbatten who agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India Once the papers of accession to India were signed Indian soldiers entered Kashmir with orders to stop any further occupation but they were not allowed to expel anyone from the state India took the matter to the United Nations The UN resolution asked Pakistan to vacate the areas it has occupied and asked India to assist the UN Plebiscite Commission to organize a plebiscite to determine the will of the people Pakistan refused to vacate the occupied areas

Today Kashmir is split as follows

India and Pakistan have fought several wars over Kashmir In 1949 and 1972 they agreed on a border for most of the Territories This demarcation line which marks the border between India and Pakistan is known as Line of Control It is guarded by Indian and Pakistani troops

The border between Aksai Chin held by China and Jammu and Kashmir held by India is known as Line of Actual Control

Another reason behind the dispute over Kashmir is water Many rivers start in Kashmir Some of them are tributaries of the Indus River basin such as the Jhelum and Chenab River These flow into Pakistan Other rivers like the Ravi Beas River and the Sutlej irrigate northern India Pakistan has been apprehensive that in a dire need India under whose portion of Kashmir lies the origins and passage of the said rivers would use its strategic advantage and withhold the flow and thus choke the agrarian economy of Pakistan

One of the origins of the conflict is that with the Boundary Award of 1947 many of the Pakistani irrigation systems can be controlled from India because some of them are now located in Indian territory The Indus Waters Treaty signed in 1960 resolved most of these disputes over the sharing of water It called both parties to co operate in this regard The treaty faced issues because India has since constructed dams which limit the water flow to the Pakistani side

UN The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on the map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations Dotted line represents approximately the Line of Control of Jammu and Kashmir agreed upon by the Republic of India and the Government of Pakistan since 1972 Both the parties have not yet agreed upon the final status of the region and nothing significant has been implemented since the peace process began in 2004 See UN map of Jammu and Kashmir accepted by most countries of the world

Islamabad The Government of Pakistan maintains un provisionally and unconditionally stating that the informal Accession of Jammu and Kashmir to Pakistan or even to the Republic of India remains to be decided by UN plebiscite It accepts UNs map of the territory The designations and the presentation of the Kashmirs regional map based on UNO practice do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the Commonwealth Secretariat or the publishers concerning the legal status of any country territory or area or of its authorities or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries There is no intention to define the status Jammu andor Kashmir which has not yet been agreed upon by the parties It further says that boundaries must be based on historical geographical and not political oreintated 

New Delhi The Government of India states that the external artificial boundaries of the Republic of India especially concerning the international borders under its jurisdiction created by a foreign body are neither correct nor authenticated

Beijing The Communist government of the Peoples Republic Of China maintains its control over what is known as the Chinese Kashmir it is claimed and disputed by the Republic of India however recognized by Pakistan as part of China as per its claimed stating that the Line of Actual Control is not demarcated or boundary undefined the frontier is yet to be finalised between the states involved

Rural areas are areas which are not towns or cities They are often farming or agricultural areas These areas are sometimes called the country or countryside People who live in the country often live in small villages but they might also live somewhere where there are no other houses nearby

Rural is the opposite of urban which means places such as cities where buildings and places where people work and live are all close together

Many people who live in cities like to go to the country to relax They go there for recreation often for their holidays

In the US the term rural areas technically describes a place that has less than 500 inhabitants per square mile

Commonly associated with Christmas Santa Claus is mostly shown as a fat and happy man wearing a red suit with white trim According to the American version of the legend Santa as he is often known lives in the North Pole with his wife Mrs Claus some elves who build his toys and reindeer who pull his sled Father Christmas the Nordic version of the myth is said to reside in Lapland Finland He is also associated with bringing gifts to small children on Christmas by sliding down fireplace chimneys and reindeer pulling his sled 

The tradition originally comes from Finland and then spread to the world Santa Claus is most likely created from the Dutch Sinterklaas who was also known as St Nick There are many popular culture items about Santa Santa Claus is known as Saint Nicholas Saint Nick Father Christmas Santa Santy Kris Kringle Kristingle Christingle and many other names

Santa Claus lives in a small hill called Korvatunturi in Lapland Finland in the Nordic myth There is a theme park in Rovaniemi which is near Korvatunturi called Santa Claus Village 

The saint who inspired the legend of Sinterklaas is Saint Nicholas who lived in the 4th Century AD and had a reputation for secret gift giving such as putting coins in the shoes of those who left them out for him

Cinnamon is a kind of tree Sometimes it is used to make a kind of exotic spice It is very aromatic sweet and spicy People usually put cinnamon in sweet baked goods hot wine or liquors The spice is made from the bark of the tree

The Sinhalese name is kurundu and is pronounced kurundu Cinnamon is grown as an export crop in Sri Lanka

Egg can mean different things

Science fiction is a kind of story Science fiction stories can be novels movies TV shows comic books and other literature

SF is often about the future It can be about imaginary new science and inventions such as spaceships time machines and robots Science fiction stories are often in a world that is very different from the real world They can have science and tools that does not exist in reality Science fiction stories often take place on other worlds There are often alien creatures

Science fiction is different from fantasy Fantasy stories often have magic and other things that do not exist and are not science Isaac Asimov was a famous science fiction writer He once said that science fiction is possible but fantasy is not

Writers often use SF to explain everyday questions or problems by putting them in the future Usually the world becomes very different to help people notice important ideas

Science fiction changes over time Some authors wrote SF books before this type of writing had a name These writers and books were not called science fiction when they were published But they are often called science fiction today

Two broad genres of science fiction are Hard SF and Soft SF Although not everyone agrees on the exact definitions of these two types the way they use science or the type of science used in the stories is different

Hard science fiction or hard SF is special because it uses true facts and theories from sciences These sciences are very important in Hard SF physics astrophysics and chemistry Also Hard SF can show worlds that more advanced technology may make possible Many correct predictions of the future come from the hard science fiction subgenre However there have been many incorrect ideas about the future too Some hard SF writers have also worked as professional scientists A few of these scientistwriters are Gregory Benford and Geoffrey A Landis while mathematician authors include Rudy Rucker and Vernor Vinge Other noteworthy hard SF authors include Arthur C Clarke Hal Clement Isaac Asimov Greg Bear Larry Niven Robert J Sawyer Stephen Baxter Alastair Reynolds Charles Sheffield and Greg Egan

Soft science fiction stories take ideas from social sciences such as psychology economics political science sociology and anthropology Some important writers in this category include Ursula K Le Guin and Philip K Dick Soft SF can be mostly about character and emotion Ray Bradbury won a prize called the SFWA Grand Master and writes in this style The Soviet Union produced social science fiction too Some examples are Strugatsky brothers Kir Bulychov and Ivan Yefremov

Some Social SF and Soft SF can be types of speculative fiction for example utopian or dystopian stories George Orwells Nineteen Eighty Four Aldous Huxleys Brave New World and Margaret Atwoods The Handmaids Tale are examples Some people think that satirical novels in fantastic settings such as Gullivers Travels by Jonathan Swift are speculative fiction

Within Hard or Soft SF there are different types or subgenres of science fiction Each subgenre is a group of stories that uses similar ideas or styles of writing Publishing companies and critics put works of SF into different subgenres to help describe the work to help readers choose which books to read ro films to watch Assigning genres is not simple Some stories can be in two or more genres at the same time Other stories may not fit any genre

In Alternate history stories writers imagine how the past might have been different These stories may use time travel to change the past Some set a story in a universe with a different history from our own These are some important alternate history books

The Sidewise Award is for the best works in this subgenre The name Sidewise is taken from Murray Leinsters 1934 story Sidewise in Time Harry Turtledove is one of the most famous writers in the subgenre He is often called the master of alternate history

Apocalyptic fiction is about the end of civilization There are several types through war pandemic astronomic impact ecological disaster or mankinds self destruction or some other general disaster Apocalyptic SF may also be about world or civilization after a disaster

Cyberpunk began in the early 1980s Bruce Bethke used this word as the title for a short story in 1980 by putting together two words cybernetics and punk Soon people used this word to describe William Gibsons book Neuromancer Cyberpunk authors can put their stories in different settings Stories usually take place in the near future and the settings are often dystopian These are often societies with very advanced technology A few huge corporations usually control the society Another early cyberpunk novel that has become a classic is Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson

Military science fiction stories happen during wars These wars can be between different countries different planets or between different species The stories are told by characters who are soldiers They include detail about military technology rules and history Some Military SF may be similar to real historical conflicts Heinleins Starship Troopers is an early example Another is the Dorsai novels of Gordon Dickson Joe Haldemans The Forever War is a response to the World War IIstyle stories of earlier military SF authors Haldeman was a soldier in the Vietnam War Important military SF authors include John Ringo David Drake David Weber and S M Stirling Baen Books is known for cultivating military science fiction authors

Superhuman stories are about humans who get special abilities that are not normal Maybe the new powers come from nature Two examples of this type are Olaf Stapledons novel Odd John and Theodore Sturgeons More Than Human Sometimes scientists give people special powers on purpose one example is AE van Vogts novel Slan Frederick Pohls novel Man Plus is another good example from this category In that book government scientists make a man into a powerful cyborg

These stories usually have two main points One is the feeling of loneliness and separation that these superhuman people feel The other is societys reaction to them

Space opera is adventure science fiction in outer space or on distant planets Action is more important than the science or characters There is usually a strong hero and a very big conflict The action often moves to many different places Edward E Smith was an early Space opera writer Flash Gordon and Star Wars are also popular examples

Some people may think that Space Western is a kind of Space opera It takes ideas from books and films about exploring the American Old West and moves them to space in the future These stories are often on frontier colony worlds serving as stand ins for the backdrop of lawlessness and economic expansion that were predominant in the American west Some examples are Firefly and the movie Serenity by Joss Whedon Anime programs like Cowboy Bebop and Outlaw Star are also Space Westerns Han Solo from Star Wars is an important Space Western character

The first important time travel novel was Mark Twains A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurs Court The most famous is H G Wellss 1895 novel The Time Machine Wells book uses a machine that allows an operator to travel to an exact time Twains time traveler is struck in the head The term time machine was invented by Wells Now it is the name for any vehicle that can take a rider to a one date Ray Bradburys 1952 short story called A Sound of Thunder is a more recent and very famous example of this genre Time travel stories can be complicated They have logical problems such as the grandfather paradox Time travel is a popular subject in modern science fiction in print movies and television

Science fiction fandom is the community of the literature of ideas the culture in which new ideas emerge and grow before being released into society at large Members of this community fans are in contact with each other at conventions or clubs through print or online fanzines or on the Internet using web sites mailing lists and other resources

SF fandom emerged from the letters column in Amazing Stories magazine Soon fans began writing letters to each other and then grouping their comments together in informal publications that became known as fanzines Once they were in regular contact fans wanted to meet each other and they organized local clubs In the 1930s the first science fiction conventions gathered fans from a wider area Conventions clubs and fanzines were the main fan activities or fanac for decades until the Internet improved communication among a much larger population of interested people

There are two very important science fiction awards the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award The Hugo is presented by the World Science Fiction Society at Worldcon each year The Nebula is presented by SFWA and voted on by the community of authors One important award for science fiction films is the Saturn Award The Academy of Science Fiction Fantasy and Horror Films gives this award each year

There are national awards like Canadas Aurora Award and the UK Arthur C Clarke Award regional awards like the Endeavour Award presented at Orycon for works from the Pacific Northwest special interest or subgenre awards like the Chesley Award for art or the World Fantasy Award for fantasy Magazines may organize reader polls notably the Locus Award

Conventions are held in cities around the world catering to a local regional national or international membership General interest conventions cover all aspects of science fiction while others focus on a particular interest like media fandom filking etc Most are organized by volunteers in non profit groups though most media oriented events are organized by commercial promoters The conventions activities are called the program which may include panel discussions readings autograph sessions costume masquerades and other events Activities that occur throughout the convention are not part of the program these commonly include a dealers room art show and hospitality lounge

Conventions may host award ceremonies Worldcons present the Hugo Awards each year SF societies are a year round base of activities for science fiction fans They may be associated with an ongoing science fiction convention or have regular club meetings or both Most groups meet in libraries schools and universities community centers pubs or restaurants or the homes of individual members Long established groups like the New England Science Fiction Association and the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society have clubhouses for meetings and storage of convention supplies and research materials

The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America was founded by Damon Knight in 1965 as a non profit organization to serve the community of professional science fiction authors 24 years after his essay Unite or Fie had led to the organization of the National Fantasy Fan Federation Fandom has helped support related groups as they started to form including media fandom the Society for Creative Anachronism gaming filking and furry fandom

The first science fiction fanzine The Comet was published in 1930 Fanzine printing methods have changed over the decades from the mimeograph and the ditto machine to modern photocopying The number of copies was usually not enough to use commercial printing Modern fanzines are printed on computer printers or at local copy shops or they may only be sent as email The best known fanzine today is Ansible David Langford is the editor and it has won several Hugo awards Other fanzines that won awards recently include File 770 Mimosa and Plokta Artists working for fanzines have risen to prominence in the field including Brad W Foster Teddy Harvia and Joe Mayhew the Hugos include a category for Best Fan Artists The earliest organized fandom online was the SF Lovers community originally a mailing list in the late 1970s with a text archive file that was updated regularly In the 1980s Usenet groups greatly expanded the circle of fans online In the 1990s the development of the World Wide Web made the online fan community much much larger Fans created thousands and then millions of web sites devoted to science fiction and related genres for all media Most of these websites are small ephemeral or about very specific topics Though sites like SF Site and Read and Find Out give readers a broad range of references and reviews about science fiction

Fan fiction is non commercial fiction created by people who love an SF story or world Fans write stories that take place in the setting of an established book film or television series Some people call it fanfic In some cases the copyright owners of the books films or television series have instructed their lawyers to issue cease and desist letters to fans

Blaise Pascal was a French mathematician whose mother died when he was 3 years old His fathers name was tienne He had two sisters Jaqueline and Gilberte Pascal was completely educated by his father Pascal was considered a child prodigy Though best known for his works in math including the creation of Pascals Triangle which is named after him and developments in the field of probability Pascal was also a scientist He wrote in support of the scientific method and also contributed to physics Later he wrote two books about Christianity

Pascal was born in Clermont France and died in Paris France at 39 He died from a malignant stomach ulcer

Antidisestablishmentarianism is one of the longest words in the English language It is often used just because of its length and not because of its meaning Part of the reason for this is that antidisestablishmentarianism describes something that people no longer talk about very much

An official state church is called the established church so a disestablishmentarian is a person who wants to get rid of the established church This persons ideas are called disestablishmentarianism 

And antidisestablishmentarianism describes groups of people who are against getting rid of the established church It is very often used to describe those who do not want the Church of England to stop being established In other words they want the Church of England to continue being established

Crohns disease Crohn disease or Leniowski Crohn disease is an illness that causes the intestines or other parts of the digestive tract to become swollen and sometimes develop ulcers People with Crohns disease often have pain in the gut diarrhea vomiting and weight loss Crohns can also cause skin rashes arthritis and swollen eyes

Nobody knows exactly what causes Crohns disease In the disease the persons body attacks itself The immune system attacks healthy parts of the digestive tract This causes inflammation or swelling in the digestive tract Therefore Crohns disease is one of two inflammatory bowel diseases and one of many autoimmune diseases

Like many other autoimmune diseases Crohns disease seems to be connected to the persons genes People whose brothers or sisters have the disease are the most likely to get it Men and women are both just as likely to get Crohns disease

Pet doors also known as cat doors dog doors doggie doors or in the United Kingdom cat flaps are small doors for pets They are usually built in regular doors but can also be in windows or walls They usually have the hinge on the top with no latch so the animal can push their way in and out Newer models sometimes only let the pet go outside but not inside Others have a latch and something that can be put on the pet that makes the latch open when the pet gets close to the door They are most commonly used for pet cats but can also be used for dogs miniature pigs or other small pets

The James Bond book and film Goldfinger is about somebody trying to blow up Fort Knox

This is what the symbols mean

B is the magnetic flux that goes through the area A that the second equation describes

E is the electric field that the magnetic flux causes

s is a closed path in which current is induced for example a wire

This law is like Faradays law of electromagnetic induction

Some textbooks show the right hand sign of the integral form with an N in front of the flux derivative The N can be taken care of in calculating A and it is an engineering detail so its left out here

The negative sign is needed for conservation of energy It is so important that it even has its own name Lenzs law

This equation shows how the electric and magnetic fields have to do with each other For example this equation explains how electric motors and electric generators work In a motor or generator the field circuit has a fixed electric field that causes a magnetic field This is called fixed excitation The varying voltage is measured across the armature circuit Maxwells equations are used in a right handed coordinate system To use them in a left handed system without having to change the equations the polarity of magnetic fields has to made opposite

H is the magnetic field strength which you can get by multiplying the magnetic flux B by a constant called the permeability and J is the current density defined by 

J qvdV 

v is a vector field called the drift velocity It describes the speeds of the charge carriers that have a density described by the scalar function q

The fact that both electric and magnetic fields are combined into a single tensor shows the fact that according to relativity both of these are different parts of the same thingby changing frames of reference what looks like an electric field in one frame can look like a magnetic field in another frame and the other way around

Henry Knox was a military leader for the Americans during the American Revolutionary War Originally from Boston Massachusetts he was appointed Chief Artillery Officer of the Continental Army He is best known for transporting cannons and other artillery from Fort Ticonderoga to Boston through icy conditions using oxen Later George Washington named him the first Secretary of War 

The American Revolutionary War was a war fought between Great Britain and the original 13 British colonies in America The war took place from 1775 to 1783 The American Army led by George Washington and other generals defeated the armies of the British Empire The colonies became independent which meant that the British Empire was no longer in charge of them 

The war started after years of problems between people and the British Empire and the colonists of North America There were 13 colonies and the colonists did not like many of the actions of the British government and taxes The colonists fought to take land from the natives but they did not own it They had to pay rent to the butt King in London Many colonists did not think this was fair In 1765 the British Parliament passed a Law called the Stamp Act This law said that colonists had to buy stamps for all legal papers newspapers and even playing cards The colonies did not follow this law Large groups of people attacked people who were even thought to have the stamps The law was changed in 1766 By this time many colonists believed the revolution against King George III was already fought and won The British sent more soldiers to keep control of the colonies In 1774 the British passed the Intolerable Acts Other battles were also fought before the war started The Boston Tea Party and Boston Massacre caused people to become more mad about the situation

Not all colonists wanted to leave the British Empire The Loyalists or Tories stayed loyal to Great Britain They were not going to change their views The Patriots or Whigs who were said to have the opposite view of the Loyalists wanted independence Before the Revolutionary War most people in America were Loyalists but after it most people were Patriots

Many colonists wrote letters showing how they felt Thomas Paine wrote Common Sense a famous pamphlet about independence from Britain Other colonial leaders such as Samuel Adams Benjamin Franklin John Adams and Thomas Jefferson wanted independence

The first battles of the American Revolutionary War were Lexington and Concord One of the first major battles was the battle of Bunker Hill in 1775 After that the British controlled Boston Around that time the Second Continental Congress sent an Olive Branch Petition to King George III and named George Washington head of the army Early in 1776 Washington drove the British out of Boston Then the Continental Army and British troops under William Howe fought several battles in and around New York City such as Long Island Kips Bay Fort Washington and White Plains During the New York battles the British first started using Hessian troops who were from Germany Though the colonists lost New York Washington was able to hold onto most of his army Over Christmas 1776 77 Washington crossed the Delaware River and defeated the Hessians at Trenton and the British at Princeton 

In 1777 the British attacked the country of Philadelphia then the American capital Two battles were fought over Philadelphia Brandywine and Germantown Again the Americans lost a major city but Washington was able to keep most of his army Around this time the Frenchman Lafayette joined the American Army In 1778 the British left Philadelphia  Between 1778 and 1781 most battles between Washington and the British were inconclusive 

One of the most important battles was the battle of Saratoga in 1777 American soldiers under Horatio Gates forced a British under John Burgoyne This led to France and Spain joining the war on the side of Americans From 1778 to 1780 there was fighting in the West In the South General Nathanael Greene led a campaign in the Carolinas He caused many people in the South to be Patriots instead of Loyalists and won several battles against the British The American sailor John Paul Jones also won several naval battles over the British The Americans tried to capture Canada several times but failed each time 

In 1781 Washington and French general Jean Rochambeau led an offensive against British troops in Yorktown Virginia This was called the Battle of Yorktown The British surrendered

Great Britain accepted the independence of the colonies It also gave all the land it said it owned which was west of the Appalachians as far as the Mississippi River to the new country

The Continental Army was the fighting force of the thirteen British colonies in the American Revolutionary War It was created in 1775 by the First Continental Congress Most of the army was broken wikt linkdisbanddisbanded in 1783 after the conclusion of the war The army was officially closed by a resolution of Congress in 1784 The United States Army replaced it

George Washington was elected the commander in chief of the Continental Army when it was formed and served until its replacement

The Siberian Tiger also known as the Amur Tiger Manchurian or North China Tiger is a subspecies of the tiger of the Felidae family It is also the largest and most powerful member of the Felidae family It is thought that the tigers originally come from Siberia 

The male Siberian tigers can weigh as much as 840 pounds averaging 660 pounds Females weigh 450 pounds though some weigh 500 pounds and two have been recorded to be 520 pounds The Siberian Tiger is usually only 2 4 inches taller at the shoulder than the Bengal tiger Old males reach a head and the body length of 13 feet long though the usual is 9  12 feet The Siberian Tiger is found in a very small part of eastern Russia with a few in the nearby northern parts of Korea and China It is very endangered and almost all over the world in zoos they are protected There are only 200 left

Before Amur Tigers were protected strictly in Soviet Union but when it broke there was less protection and the number came downnly 400 500 left

Amur tigers usually eat elk deer and cattle But if they have little food they would have to eat brown bears and leopards It would also eat also eats domestic dog if it is from its habitat

The Siberian tiger can be recognised by the fur around the neck which makes it warm This is an adaption against the cold Close to the winter the Siberian tigers hair grows longer so they can face the wintry weather

Mount St Helens is a volcano in the US state of Washington It is 96 miles south of Seattle and 53 miles northeast of Portland Oregon The volcano is in Cascade Range of mountains It is part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc in the Pacific Ring of Fire that includes over 160 active volcanoes Mount St Helens was first called Louwala Clough which means smoking or fire mountain in the language of the Native American Klickitat people

This volcano is well known for its explosions and flows of lava Its most famous volcanic eruption was on May 18 1980 In 1982 US President Ronald Reagan and the United States Congress made the Mount St Helens National Volcanic Monument a 110000 acre area around the volcano that is also a part of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest

The 1980 eruption was the deadliest and most economically destructive volcanic event in the history of the United States Fifty seven people were killed 250 homes 47 bridges 15 miles of railways and 185 miles of highway were destroyed A massive debris avalanche was triggered by an earthquake measuring 51 on the Richter scale This caused the eruption which reduced the height of the mountains summit from Convert9677ftm0abbron to Convert8365ftm0abbron and replacing it with a Convert1mikm wide horseshoe shaped crater The earthquake was caused by a sudden surge of magma from the Earths mantle The debris avalanche was up to 07 cubic miles in volume

Before the eruption in 1980 Mount St Helens was the fifth highest peak in Washington State The peak rose more than 5000 feet above its base where it rises from the ridges that are around it It stood out from the surrounding hills because of the symmetrical cone shape and the snow that covered the top Because of its cone shape it was called the Mount Fuji of America after the famous Mount Fuji which is a symbol of Japan

In the months before the large eruption that took place on May 18 1980 there were many signs of volcanic activity On March 20 1980 Mount St Helens was the center of a magnitude 42 earthquake Steam venting from the volcano started on March 27 By the end of April the north side of the volcano started to grow larger 

On May 18 a second earthquake of magnitude 51 made a huge part of the north face of the volcano collapse It was the largest known debris avalanche in recorded history At 0832 am Pacific Daylight Time the magma inside of St Helens exploded On the Volcanic Explosivity Index scale the eruption was rated a five which is the same rating of the famous Vesuvius eruption in 79 AD 

For more than nine hours ash erupted from the volcano rising into the air for 12 to 16 miles above sea level in the air This cloud rising from a volcano is called a plume The pyroclastic flow of heated rocks and gas that poured out of the Volcano spread over an area of over 230 square miles destroying plants and buildings The ash spread east at about 60 miles per hour with some ash reaching Idaho by about 1200 pm almost 35 hours after the eruption By about 530 pm the plume of ash became smaller Through the night and for several days after there were smaller eruptions 

As well as the effect of the fast moving hot gasses and stones from the explosion the collapse of the northern side of Mount St Helens caused lahars or volcanic mudflows These were mixtures of volcanic ash with melted ice and snow The lahars went many miles down the Toutle and Cowlitz rivers destroying bridges and killing many trees A total of 39 million cubic yards of material was carried 17 miles south into the Columbia River by the lahars

The St Helens May 18 eruption released 24 megatons of thermal energy It released more than 067 cubic miles of ash and other material The collapse of the north side of the volcano shortened St Helens height by about 1300 feet and left a crater one to two miles wide and half of a mile deep The eruption killed 57 people nearly 7000 game animals and about 12 million fish from a fish farm It destroyed or damaged over 200 homes 185 miles of highway and convert15mikm0 of railways

Between 1980 and 1986 more volcanic activity continued at Mount Saint Helens with a new lava dome made in the crater Several small explosions and eruptions took place making more lava domes From December 7 1989 to January 6 1990 and from November 5 1990 to February 14 1991 the volcano erupted with sometimes huge clouds of ash

The ash reached a number of states as far east as Montana and as south as Colorado

Magma bubbles came to the top of the volcano on about October 11 2004 and a new lava dome was made on the first domes south side This new dome grew throughout 2005 and into 2006 Several new features were seen such as the whaleback which is solid magma being pushed to the top of the volcano by magma under it These features do not last long and break down soon after they are formed On July 2 2005 the tip of the whaleback broke off and a rockfall sent ash several hundred meters into the air 

Mount St Helens showed important new activity on March 8 2005 when a 36000 foot plume of steam and ash came from the volcano The plume was seen from as far away as Seattle a city that is 96 miles away This fairly small eruption took place because of a new lava dome being formed and a 25 magnitude earthquake

Another feature that grew from the dome is a fin or slab About half the size of a football field the large volcanic rock was being moved up as fast as 6 feet per day In mid June 2006 the slab had rockfalls very often but was still being pushed up from inside the volcano 

On October 22 2006 at 313 pm PST a magnitude 35 earthquake broke the lava dome The resulting collapse and avalanche sent an ash plume 2000 feet over the crater although it quickly disappeared

On December 19 2006 a large white plume of steam was seen and some journalists from the media thought there had been a small eruption However the Cascades Volcano Observatory of the United States Geological Survey says that there was no large ash plume so it could not have been an eruption The volcano has been erupting on occasion since October 2004

The Oder Neisse line is the border between Germany and Poland since the end of the Second World War As a result of the defeat Germany lost another huge part of its territory to Poland after it already had to cede the former Prussian provinces of Posen and Westpreuen as well as parts of upper Silesia to the newly founded Polish state after the First World War in 1919

The population of the eastern German provinces as well as the German minority population in what was Poland before the Second World War either fled before the Russian army to central and western Germany or were later driven out of their homeland by force of the Polish militia who entered immediately after the Russian army

As Poland annexed the German provinces and expatriated the native population Polish people occupied those provinces and took over land and property of the expatriated Germans About 15 million of the new inhabitants had been driven out of their own homeland in eastern PolandWestern Urkraine Belorussia as the USSR was not willing to give back that part of 1922 1939 Poland which it had annexed in 1939

The rules on what Congress can do are in Article 1 of the United States Constitution The primary duty of Congress is to write debate and pass bills  For Congress to pass a bill both houses must pass exactly the same bill For each house to pass a bill more than half of its members must vote in favor of passing the bill After both house pass the same bill this bill is then sent to the President If the President agrees the bill should be a law he or she signs the bill within 10 days If the president does not agree then he or she can veto the bill and send it back to Congress If the bill is neither signed nor vetoed by the president within 10 days the bill becomes law anyway if Congress does not adjourn within that time If Congress adjourns within that time the bill does not become a law Congress may override a presidents veto of a bill by having more than two thirds of its members passing the bill In that case the bill becomes law even though the president vetoed it 

Article 1 of the US Constitution lists what subjects Congress can pass laws on 

Members of Congress cannot be arrested except for certain crimes during a session of Congress or going to or returning from a session 

Each house of Congress can decide to expel one of its members if more than two thirds of them vote to expel him or her

Forks are very common in Western Culture Many countries do not use forks but instead have their own ways to eat food

Backgammon is a game played by two players Each player moves pieces around a board Players roll two dice to find out how far their pieces can move in one turn The winner of one game is the first to get all pieces all the way around and off the board

The game is laid out asymmetrically Whites direction of travel is counter clockwise whereas blacks direction of travel is clockwise

White moves from whites far right to whites home area on whites close right in the shape of a right hand C from whites point of view Black moves along the same C beginning from blacks far left and ending at blacks home area on blacks close left

As shown in the image some pieces begin already in the home quadrant and some pieces must make their way all the way around Pieces can be sent backwards to their starting position during play

The roll of two dice introduces a random component in the game but Backgammon is basically a game of strategy 

Usual playing time is around 15 30 minutes for a single game An overall championship or round of backgammon involves a number of ongoing single games with the involvement of points a doubling cube and other complications

The game has a long history Games that resemble it have been played for thousands of years Archaeologists doing excavations at a place called Burnt City in modern day Iran have found parts of a game that resembled backgammon They have found 60 pieces to play with and two dice They could show that the game utensils date from around 3000 BC These pieces around 100200 years older than another set found in Ur in Mesopotamia 

A cell wall is the wall of a plant cell Animals cells do not have cell walls It is there mainly to protect the cell from damage It is also there to make the cell strong to keep its shape and to control the growing of the cell and plant

In a plant cell the cell wall is made of long molecules called cellulose pectin and hemicellulose The cell wall lets some proteins in and keeps others out Water and small molecules can go through to help the cell The cell wall is the outermost layer of nonliving cellulose and is only found in plant and bacterial cells

Friction is a force that acts to stop the movement of two touching things The energy lost to friction is turned into sound and heat Two kinds of friction are static and kinetic Static friction is when the friction is strong enough to stop movement between two objects Kinetic friction is when the frictional force is not strong enough to stop all motion

Some facts about friction are

A Fourier transform is a mathematical function that allows to show the different parts of a continuous signal Fourier transforms are often used to calculate the frequency spectrum of a signal that changes over time Such signals are found in many applications like recognising speech or handwriting but also in cryptography or oceanography 

A Fourier transform really just shows you what frequencies are in a signal For instance if you have a sound wave and it has the musical notes A and B and C in it the Fourier transform of that signal will show the frequency on the x axis with peaks in the graph at the frequencies of the notes A B and C

You can create many signals by adding together many cosines and sines of different amplitudes and frequencies The Fourier transform is just the amplitude and phases of these cosines and sines plotted against their respective frequency

Fourier transforms are important because many signals make more sense when you look at what frequencies are in them rather than when you look at the signal with time on the x axis An example is the audio example above It would not be obvious that the notes A B and C were in the signal just by looking at the signal with respect to time Also many systems operate on frequencies separately so the system can be described by what it does to each frequency An example of this would be a filter that blocks the high frequencies It can also be used to solve a kind of equation in mathematics called differential equations

Calculating a Fourier transform requires understanding integration and imaginary numbers For anything but the simplest signals computers are usually used The Fast Fourier Transform is a way of calculating a Fourier transform much faster with a computer FileFunction ocsillating at 3 hertzsvgOriginal function showing a signal oscillating at 3 hertz FileOnfreqsvg Real and imaginary parts of integrand for Fourier transform at 3 hertz FileOfffreqsvg Real and imaginary parts of integrand for Fourier transform at 5 hertz FileFourier transform of oscillating functionsvg Fourier transform with 3 and 5 hertz labeled

The Divine Comedy is an epic poem written by Dante Alighieri It is about a trip through the afterlife The poem is three parts long  the three parts are Inferno Purgatorio and Paradiso Inferno is the most famous section of the poem The poem is about the travels of a man through Christian hell purgatory and heaven Note that comedy does not mean funny yet more like not ending with a bad thing

The narrator Dante Alighieri is lost in front of a giant mountain which symbolizes sin He finds the Roman poet Virgil who has to lead him through the nine circles of hell so Dante can be saved

Souls that did not accept Christ are here This includes atheists pagans and the unbaptized They did not actively sin but they could not enter Heaven because of their lack of faith and even Hell would not allow them to enter very far

The punishment for the souls is not physical but that they have no hope of seeing Christ so they are mentally punished

Beyond the first circle souls are assigned their place by Minos who wraps his tail around his legs a corresponding number of times

In this circle souls who succumb to lust They are the first ones to be truly punished in Hell These souls are blown around in a giant storm which will last forever This symbolizes the power of lust to blow one about aimlessly

This circle is guarded by Cerberus The gluttons are punished here lying in cold mud While in life they were provided with warmth and comfort from their food in Hell the souls are punished with cold and heavy rain Cerberus claws at the spirits rips at their skin and bites holes

In life the sinners miserly hoarded their money greedily while the prodigal spent their money foolishly Both groups are pushing and pulling great bags of gold as they did in life The greedy are guarded by Plutus god of riches and wealth

In the river Styx the wrathful fight each other on the surface The river surrounds the city of Dis where active sinners are located When Virgil tries to enter the angels of Hell slam the door in his face He and Dante proceed to the gate where Christ entered Hell during his three day trip to release a select few people According to the story of Christs harrowing of hell he broke the door so it could never close again

The heretics are trapped in red hot iron tombs

This circle holds those who were violent in their lives The people who were violent to people and property are in a river of fire The depth of their placement in the river corresponds to how much you damaged in life For example Alexander the Great is immersed up to his eyebrows The violent against self are turned into plants The violent to God and the violent to nature are also here They have to walk on flaming sand for eternity

Pimps seducers flatterers simonists sorcerers fortune tellers false prophets corrupt politicians hypocrites thieves schismatics alchemists and counterfeiters are in this circle Each punishment is the opposite of what they did in life Fortune tellers who tried to see things ahead of time are forced to walk backwards

The traitors to family are immersed in ice up to their faces Traitors to political entities are also here Traitors to guests lie in the ice which covers them completely except for their faces Traitors to their lords and benefactors are completely buried in ice in various positions

In the very center of Hell because he sinned the ultimate sin lies Satan Satan is described as a beast with three faces six wings and is eternally weeping from his six eyes Each of Satans mouths chews on a prominent traitor from history Brutus and Cassius are being chewed feet first The center mouth is chewing on Judas His head is being chewed on by Satan and his back is being skinned by Satans claws

Christian Johann Heinrich Heine was one of the most significant German poets of the 19th century

Heine was born into an assimilated Jewish family in Dsseldorf Germany His father was a tradesman After his fathers business failed Heine was sent to Hamburg His uncle in Hamburg was a very successful banker so Heine started learning his business but he droped it later on Then Heine started to study law at the universities of Gttingen Bonn and at the Humboldt University of Berlin but he was more interested in literature than in law He took a degree in law in 1825 At the same time he had decided to convert from Judaism to Protestantism This was necessary because of the severe restrictions on Jews in the German states Only Christians were allowed to have certain businesses or to be clerks of the state Jews were also forbidden to become university professors which was a particular ambition for Heine Heine himself said his conversion was the ticket of admission into European culture Heine is best known for his lyric poetry much of which was set to music by lieder composers esp Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann

His start as poet Heine made with Gedichte in 1821 Heines one sided infatuation with his cousins Amalie and Therese later inspired him to write some of his loveliest lyrics Buch der Lieder was Heines first comprehensive collection of verse

Heine left Germany for Paris France in 1831 There he associated with utopian socialists He met people who fellowed Count Saint Simon who preached an egalitarian classless society

He remained in Paris for the rest of his life His only visit to Germany was in 1843 German authorities banned his works and those of others who were considered to be associated with the Young Germany movement in 1835

Heine continued to comment on German politics and society from a distance Heine wrote Deutschland Ein Wintermrchen In 1844 his friend Karl Marx published it in his newspaper Vorwrts in 1844

One of the books was burned by the Nazis One of Heines most famous lines is now Where they burn books they will in the end burn human beings too

Joseph Beuys was a German artist who made arts in many forms including sculpture performance art video art and installations He was one of the most important artists in the second half of the 20th century

Beuys was born in Krefeld on 12 May 1921 but grew up in the near by city of Kleve His family was profoundly catholic As a young child he began his interest in art by often engaging in making watercolours He first saw modern art when visiting the studio of Achilles Moortgat At the age of seventeen in 1938 he joined Hitler Youth like many young German men at that time He studied many disciplines before engaging in his art practice and was particularly interested in natural sciences and history including alchemy and focussed on medicine with the intention of becoming a doctor During his studies however World War II began and he became a soldier in the German air force There he was a rear gunner in a military airplane In 1943 one of his close friends died in a concentration camp 

One fascinating aspect of Joseph Beuyss personal history is the reason he consistently used felt and fat in his works He is quoted as saying For me fat was a great discovery because it was the very material that could seem the most chaotic and indeterminate I could use it with heat or cold I could transform it with means that are not the traditional ones for sculpture with temperature for example So I could turn the character of this fat from a chaotic and fluctuating condition to that of a rigid form So I took an extreme position in sculpture and a material that was absolutely fundamental for life and not associated with art

Many people believe that this use of felt and fat recalled a plane crash experienced while flying for the Luftwaffe in the Crimea in the winter of 1942 43 Beuys claimed that he had been saved by a nomadic tribe of Tartars who sympathetic to the Germans after persecution by the Soviets covered my body in fat to help it regenerate warmth and wrapped it in felt as an insulator to keep warmth in In fact this episode was fabricated partly on the basis of a dream but he consistently referred to this episode and it can be seen as a private mythology of his

After the war Beuys studied at the academy in Dsseldorf from 1946 to 1951 For most of the 1950s he was mostly drawing

In 1961 he became professor of sculpture there but was fired in 1972 because he said that his classes must be open to anybody who wanted to take them He thought that classes should be free and he worked in his classes with everybody who wanted His students protested when he was fired so he was allowed to hold his studio there but he still lost his job

In 1962 Beuys met the Fluxus movement They made art together by drawing sculpting making music and literature Beuys became a member of the group but he was more interested in performances He believed that art has a larger role to play in society

Beuys believed that arts has an important rule in society His first problems with politicians were when he lost his job as professor In the 1980s he was part of the Peace Movement and protested against nuclear missiles in Germany He was one of the first members of the Green Party in the 1980s

Famous works are for example

In 1979 a large retrospective of Beuys work at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City confirmed his reputation as one of the most important artists of his time He died in 1986 in Dsseldorf

The web comic Cat And Girl makes frequent reference to Joseph Beuys including his art and cultural references

The Staatliche Kunstakademie Dsseldorf is the Arts Academy of the city of Dsseldorf It is well known all over the world by its most famous members like Joseph Beuys

A brothel is a bar nightclub or hotel where prostitutes work People go there to buy sex for money

In some countries operating brothels is legal in other countries it is illegal Examples of countries where brothels are illegal are Canada and most of the United States Brothels are legal in some countries from Europe for example A country which has permissive laws regarding prostitution is the Netherlands

Most of the time where legal brothels need to be registered like other businesses However even if it is legal to run a brothel there may still be conflicts with the law Examples of problem cases are

Brothels have been known for most of recorded history At first there was temple prostitution in many Mediterranean and Middle Eastern countries In Ancient Greece and Roman civilizations brothels were established Sometimes they were licensed institutions This was first recorded in Athens in 594 BC Public sources of the time said it was good that Solon installed the brothel People said this would reduce the problems caused by sexually unfulfilled sailors and workers It would also fill money into the public purse This first official brothel was soon followed by many others and also influenced the creation of special schools in which various classes of prostitutes were trained for their profession

Brothels use a variety of business models

The third option gives some way for the brothel owner to say he did not know what is going on This is especially the case where prostitution is forbidden or restricted Brothel owners often disguise their actions as running a massage parlor a bar or a similar venue 

Allowing such places can also give politicians a way to save face when they do not want to put the laws against prostitution into practice

All planets comets and asteroids in our solar system have elliptical orbits Thus they all have a closest and a farthest point from the sun a perihelion and an aphelion

Earth comes closest to the sun every year around January 3 It is farthest from the sun every year around July 4 The difference in distance between Earths nearest point to the sun in January and farthest point from the sun in July is not very great Earth is about 146 million kilometers from the sun in early January in contrast to about 150 million kilometers in early July

When Earth is closest to the sun it is winter in the northern hemisphere and summer in the southern hemisphere Thus it is possible to see that Earths distance from the sun does not cause the season to change Instead Earths seasons come and go because Earth does not orbit exactly upright with respect to the plane of our worlds orbit around the sun Earths axis is tilted to that plane by 23 and a half degrees The Earths tilted axis itself rotates about the notional axis orthogonal to the orbital plane almost precisely once per year Winter falls on that part of the globe where sunlight strikes least directly Summer falls on that part of the globe where sunlight strikes most directly

The island is named after Captain James Johnston who discovered it in 1807 The island was mined for guano until 1890 After that it was used as an army base

The MexicanAmerican War took place between 1846 and 1848 between the United States of America and Mexico 

When Mexico got independence from Spain in 1821 Texas was part of Mexico Americans and other settlers came into Texas when Mexico allowed non Spanish settlers to settle here After many settlers came to Texas Mexico started taxing non citizens This made many settlers outraged When Mexico banned slavery many slave owners from the South were even more outraged On March 2 1836 Texas declared independence from Mexico and soon they were at war Texas won but Mexico refused to recognize Texas as an independent country Texas soon asked to become a state of the United States Years later in 1845 the US annexed Texas and Mexico broke off diplomatic relations The United States offered to buy from Mexico the land extending from Texas to the Pacific Ocean but Mexico wanted to keep that vast area In 1846 a dispute over the border between Texas and Mexico resulted in armed conflict and the MexicanAmerican War began 

Some maintain that the United States provoked the border dispute so they could win the territory that Mexico would not sell There was strong sentiment in the United States that the country was destined to expand to cover the entire continent

In addition to small units sent to California and New Mexico the United States sent two major armies into Mexico under the commands of General Winfield Scott and future President of the United States General Zachary Taylor 

After the US had entered Mexico the Mexican general Antonio Lpez de Santa Anna took command of the Mexican soldiers in early 1847 The US forces fought Santa Anna near Monterrey and Buena Vista After Buena Vista the Mexican army had many problems including starvation disease and desertion The Mexican government was unstable In March 1847 Scott landed at Veracruz His force included future Civil War generals Robert E LeeUlysses S Grant Stonewall Jackson and George Meade as well as Commodore Perry Scott took Puebla in May and took Mexico City in September after the battle of Battle of Chapultepec

When American soldiers came to California there was something going on called the Bear Flag Revolt That was where California was attempting to leave Mexico and form its own country as Texas had done In July and August 1846 American soldiers captured Monterey Yerba Buena and Los Angeles After a counterattack by the Californios the Americans had taken much of California by 1847 The Mexican governor of California Pio Pico left the state

The United States won the war and Mexico signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 The treaty gave the US lands that would become the states of Arizona California New Mexico Nevada Utah southwestern Colorado and southwestern Wyoming Mexico received 15 million dollars and gave up its claims to Texas

The slavery debate in the United States became more intense with the addition of the new territory and the question of whether slavery would be legal in these new territories Also many of the officers who would lead troops in the American Civil War fought in the war and would use their experiences in the coming Civil War

The European Revolutions of 1848 were a series of revolts in Europe In some places they are called Spring of Nations or the Year of Revolution

These revolutions started in February with the French Revolution of 1848 continued in March with several other revolutions amongst them the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states The people of the countries tried to take over their governments

Edvard Grieg was a Norwegian composer and pianist who composed in the Romantic period He is Norways most famous composer He is best known for his Piano Concerto in A minor and for his incidental music to Henrik Ibsens play Peer Gynt which includes movements called Aubade and In the Hall of the Mountain King He was usually at his best when writing shorter pieces such as the collection of piano pieces called Lyric Pieces He also wrote some very lovely songs to Norwegian and to German words

Grieg was born in Bergen on 15 June 1843 His ancestors were Scottish people who had moved to Norway around 1770 The original family name was spelt Greig

Grieg came from a musical home His mother was his first piano teacher He went to several schools and started composing when he was young He used to take his compositions to school but the teacher did not show much interest in them

In the summer of 1858 Grieg met the great Norwegian violinist Ole Bull who was a friend of the family and whose brother was married to Griegs aunt Bull noticed the 15 year old boys talent and persuaded his parents to let him go to Leipzig in Germany to study music

Grieg enrolled in the conservatory concentrating on the piano and enjoyed all the concerts and recitals given in Leipzig He did not like the discipline of the conservatory course of study but he still got very good grades The first piano recital he gave was in Sweden In 1862 he finished his studies in Leipzig and went back to Bergen where he gave another recital

In 1863 Grieg went to Copenhagen Denmark and stayed there for three years He met the Danish composers J P E Hartman and Niels Gade Gade told him to go and write a symphony Grieg did not feel happy writing a long symphony although he did try He also met the Norwegian composer Rikard Nordraak who had composed the Norwegian national anthem Nordraak showed Grieg how wonderful Norwegian folk music was Grieg had hardly heard any Norwegian folk music until then When Nordraak died Grieg composed a funeral march in his honour

On 11 June 1867 Grieg married his first cousin Nina The next year their only child Alexandra was born The following summer Grieg wrote his Piano Concerto in A minor while on holiday in Denmark Edmund Neupert gave the concerto its first performance on 3 April 1869 in the Casino Theater in Copenhagen Grieg himself was unable to be there because he was conducting in Christiana

In the summer of 1869 Griegs daughter Alexandra became ill and died at the age of 13 months

In 1870 he met Franz Liszt in Rome Liszt had made it possible for Grieg to get a travel grant They played Griegs Violin Sonata No 1 together which Liszt liked very much On a second visit in April Grieg brought with him the manuscript of his Piano Concerto which Liszt played by sight Liszt gave him some advice about the orchestration

Grieg spent most of his time conducting and playing the piano in concerts He often travelled and in 1876 he went to Bayreuth to hear the first performance of Wagners Ring cycle He wrote a review of the operas for a Norwegian newspaper

In 1876 Ibsen asked Grieg to write some incidental music for the first performance of the play he had written about the Norwegian hero Peer Gynt Many of the pieces from this work became very popular They are played by orchestras as well as in arrangements for piano or for piano duet

In 1883 he and wife parted for a while although friends managed to persuade the couple to come together again and they spent four months in Rome They built a house called Troldhaugen in Bergen with a view of the fjord They moved into the house in 1885 and Grieg lived there for the rest of his life They continued to travel and give concerts Nina had a good voice and sang her husbands songs Grieg only performed his own works at concerts During his last years he received many honours

In his later life Grieg became famous although never rich The Norwegian government gave him a pension Grieg made some recordings of his piano pieces These are some of the very first gramophone recordings that were made The sound is not very good but they show that Grieg was an excellent pianist He also recorded music rolls on a pianola

Edvard Grieg died in the autumn of 1907 aged 64 after a long illness He had suffered from respiratory problems ever since he was very ill in 1860 as a student in Leipzig At his funeral thousands of people went out on the streets of his home town to honour him Following his wish his own funeral march for Rikard Nordraak was played as well as the funeral march by Frederic Chopin His and his wifes ashes are buried in a mountain crypt near his house Troldhaugen

Grieg was often inspired by Norwegian folk music This can be heard in his songs and some of his instrumental music His chamber music includes 3 violin sonatas and a cello sonata as well as a piano sonata and many shorter piano pieces However he has become very well known all over the world through his Piano Concerto and his music for Peer Gynt Another popular work is his Holberg Suite which was originally written for the piano but later arranged for string orchestra

The famous opening of Griegs Piano Concerto featured in a comedy sketch by Morecambe and Wise in the 1970s The conductor Andr Previn was their special guest in the sketch which has become a classic

Leopold Poetsch was a German professor and a high school teacher of Adolf Hitler who influenced the future leaders later views 

Poetsch came from the southern German border area There political fights between Slavs and ethnic Germans angered him and made him one who was for the Pan German movement He started to teach in Maribor Slovenia and later moved to Linz Austria to teach history

Hitler was very interested in what Poetsch said Poetsch hated the Habsburgs and argued that all ethnic Germans should be united by a single government He said that the Aryan race was stronger in better health and more fit to rule than all other people Poetsch said that Jews and Slavs were what he called inferior races

The so called Armenian Genocide was the forcible deportation and massacring of Armenians during the government of the Young Turks from 1915 to 1917 in the Ottoman Empire

In November 1914 the Ottoman Empire went into the World War I on the side of the Central Powers smail Enver who was then the Minister of War launched a disastrous military campaign against Russian forces in the Caucasus in hopes of capturing the city of Baku His forces were routed at the Battle of Sarikamis and many more of his men froze to death

Returning to Istanbul Enver largely blamed the Armenians living in the region for actively siding with the Russians In 1914 the Ottoman Empires War Office had already begun a propaganda drive to present Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire as a liability and threat to the countrys security An Ottoman naval officer in the War Office described the planning

The Armenians were murdering and ethnically cleansing the Turks and other Muslims in the Russian occupied regions of Turkey Turkish villages were looted and burned down and the Armenian gangs and terrorists were constantly attacking the Ottoman Army and destroying the Turks ability to fight the Russians  The horrifying acts of Armenian gangs urged the Ottoman administration to take action and to deport the Armenians to less critical regions 

The Ottoman government moving quickly arrested an estimated 250 Armenian intellectuals on the night of 24 April 1915

The Turkish massacres of Armenians in 1894 1895 1896 and 1909 were still fresh in their minds

The Armenian Genocide is said to have impacted Adolf Hitler according to his many references to the Ottoman killings of Armenians The extent of Hitlers knowledge of the Armenian Genocide is unclear though he did refer to their destruction several times The most known quote attributed to Hitler on the Armenians is taken from an August 1939 military meeting prior to the invasion of Poland

The modern Greek alphabet has 24 letters It is used to write the Greek language The Greek alphabet is thought to be where all important European alphabets came from Although the alphabet was borrowed from the Phoenicians around the 10th century BC there were many changes made to make it fit the Greek language The main change was that some of the Phoenician letters that were for sounds not used in Greek were turned into vowels The Phoenicians had written their alphabet without any vowels so this change made writing a lot easier to read Another change is that some new letters were invented for sounds in Greek but not in Phoenician At first Greek was written from right to left the same as Phoenician but after the 6th century BC it was written from left to right 

There were some differences in the early Greek alphabet depending on what part of the Greek world it was used in The two main kinds were the eastern and western ones But over time all Greeks started to use the same alphabet especially after the Ionic alphabet of Miletus was officially adopted in Athens in 403 BC A little later the rest of Greece did the same and by 350 BC almost all Greeks were using the same twenty four letter Greek alphabet Around this time Aristophanes of Byzantium invented the three accent marks acute grave and circumflex to mark the tone or pitch of Greek words

Puberty is what happens in childrens bodies that changes them into adults After puberty people are able to make children A young woman who has gone through puberty can become pregnant and have a baby At puberty a young mans body begins making sperm and he starts to be able to ejaculate which is semen coming out from his penis when he is sexually excited If he has sexual intercourse with a young woman he can make her pregnant Puberty is started by hormones which are chemicals that tell parts of the body to do things On average girls start puberty between the ages of 7 and 15 years and boys start between 9 and 16 years However people all over the world start puberty at different ages Changes that happen to young men and women during puberty include the sex organs growing bigger hair appearing on the body and growing taller and stronger People often notice young mens voices getting deeper and young women growing breasts and starting to menstruate

Because puberty is the time in a childs life when he or she becomes able to make children this is seen as very important Therefore people in many countries around the world have different ways of marking this event

Puberty is started and carried on by different hormones Hormones are chemicals that tell parts of the body to do things Hormones are made by glands in the body Glands are organs of the body that make hormones

This is what happens during puberty

Puberty in boys and girls starts when their bodies start making a lot of gonadotropin releasing hormone Scientists do not know for sure what causes the body to do this However they have noticed that puberty begins when girls weigh about convert47kglb0lkon and boys weigh about convert55kglb0 This suggests that the body is told to make a lot of GnRH by a hormone called leptin which is made by fat tissue People whose bodies have problems with leptin do not go through puberty

On average girls start puberty between the ages of 9 and 14 years and boys start between 10 and 17 years However just because a persons puberty does not start during these ages does not mean they are not normal People from all over the world start puberty at different ages This is because of their environment and maybe even events in their lives Here are some of the things that make puberty happen at different ages in people

Girls usually reach their adult height and become sexually mature about four years after puberty starts Boys grow for about six years after puberty starts Puberty in boys starts off more slowly than in girls but then speeds up later on Although boys are usually about convert2cmin1lkon shorter than girls before puberty begins adult men on average end up about convert13cmin1 taller than women

For most boys puberty takes about six years and ends when they are about 17 or 18 years old At the end of puberty a teenager is usually about 10 to 30 centimetres taller 7 to 29 kilograms heavier and stronger He is also able to make a woman pregnant

The first sign of puberty in boys is that their testicles and scrotum grow bigger Before puberty each testicle is about 15 to 2 cm long and has a volume of about 2 to 3 cubic centimetres About six years after puberty starts the testicles reach their adult size The volume of an average adult mans testicle is about 18 to 20 cc However it is normal for some men to have testicles smaller than this size and for other men to have larger testicles

The penis also grows bigger during puberty At the start of puberty the average length of the penis is 6 cm The penis reaches adult size about five years later A study done in 1996 found the mean length of an adult mans penis is 35 in when it is flaccid The average length of an erect penis is about 129 to 15 cm

The testicles have two main jobs to make hormones and sperm The testicles make the hormone testosterone which spreads around the body This causes the changes in the body that make a boy grow into a man Testosterone also makes a man feel like having sex One year after puberty begins when boys urinate after waking up in the morning some sperm can be found in the urine When a boy is about 13 years old his testicles will have grown to the stage that he may be fertile However it will be still be difficult for him to do so Boys usually only become fully fertile when they reach about 14 to 16 years of age The sperm in the testicles mixes with other liquids in the body to form a whitish or yellowish and sticky fluid called semen During puberty two glands in the body called the seminal vesicles and prostate also grow bigger These glands make a lot of the liquid that is in semen

When a man is sexually excited he gets an erection his penis becomes bigger longer and harder A male can become sexually excited if thinks about sex or sees a good looking person or if his penis rubs against something During puberty some boys also have spontaneous erections These are erections that happen by themselves without any reason This can be embarrassing when it happens in a public place

When a mans penis is sexually stimulated for some time he has an orgasm and semen shoots out from the penis This is called ejaculation Young boys cannot ejaculate A boys first ejaculation usually happens about one year after he begins puberty For some boys the first ejaculation takes place when they are sleeping This is called a nocturnal emission or a wet dream It happens without the boys control often when he is having a dream about sex Scientists believe that wet dreams are the bodys way of removing too much semen A study done of 5300 white men in the United States in 1948 found that 13 of them had their first ejaculation through a wet dream This seems to tell us that most boys have their first ejaculation after masturbating A male masturbates when he rubs his penis to make himself feel good sexually The study also found that most boys who have their first ejaculation by masturbating do this a year or more earlier than boys who have their first ejaculation through a wet dream A 2004 survey by a magazine in Canada found that most males started masturbating when they were about 12 to 13 years old When a boy begins masturbating wet dreams often stop happening because semen is taken out from his body regularly

When a boy starts to ejaculate he usually produces only a small amount of semen The semen is different from what an adult man produces It is usually clear and stays sticky It either has no sperm in it or sperm that do not move properly or do not move at all A boys semen only becomes like an adult mans semen about two years after his first ejaculation

Not long after a boys testicles and penis start to grow pubic hair begins to appear Pubic hair is hair that grows in the pubic region which is the part of the body where the penis is Pubic hair is shorter curlier and rougher than hair on the head It usually starts growing on the abdomen above the penis at the place where it joins the body There may also be some hair on the scrotum After about six months to a year there will be a large triangle of hair in the pubic region Within three to four years after puberty begins there is a lot of pubic hair in the area above the penis Later on pubic hair also grows on the abdomen upwards towards the navel and on the insides of the thighs

About two years after pubic hair starts to appear hair also grows on other parts of the body

The hair on the arms legs chest abdomen and back may also become thicker Different men have different amounts of body hair Many boys begin shaving when hair starts growing on their faces

A larger amount of male hormones in the body cause changes to perspiration This gives it a more adult body odor or smell The hormones also cause sebaceous glands in the skin to make more sebum a type of oil that keeps the skin from getting too dry Sebum and dead skin cells can mix with a type of germ called bacteria and block pores in the skin This causes a skin problem called acne Most people get acne during puberty When a person has acne he gets swellings on his skin called blackheads whiteheads and pimples Blackheads and whiteheads are painless but pimples can be red and painful They usually form on the face but can also appear on the neck shoulders upper back and chest Oil glands on scalp the part of the head on which hair grows also make a lot of sebum This can cause dandruff in which small white bits of skin fall from the scalp

During puberty a boys larynx or voicebox also grows larger This makes the laryngeal prominence or Adams apple the lump that sticks out of the front of his neck larger too As the larynx grows the vocal chords become longer and thicker so they vibrate more slowly This causes the voice to lower in pitch or tone and become deeper When this happens it is sometimes said that the boys voice has broken However it actually does not happen overnight but over some time During this time the voice may sound scratchy On average a boys voice normally reaches its adult sound when he is around 15 years old

Towards the end of puberty boys go through a growth spurt which lasts for about two to three years During this time their body grows taller very quickly When the growth spurt is at its fastest point some people grow convert10cmin0abbron or more a year This happens about two years after puberty starts usually between the ages of 13 and 15 When a boy reaches the end of his growth spurt when he is about 18 years old he will be at his adult height His body will not grow much taller after that Because of their growth spurt boys muscles can feel sore These growing pains can feel worse if boys are active and do a lot of exercise They go away after a while Boys grow more slowly than girls but for a longer time That is why most men are taller than women

In the male body some of the hormone testosterone is changed into another hormone called estradiol Estradiol sometimes causes boys to grow small breasts This is called gynecomastia Scientists think that about half of all boys have gynecomastia in one or both sides of the chest There can be some swelling and pain The growth usually disappears by the end of puberty However if the breast growth is very obvious and is causing him a lot of worry it can be removed by surgery

During the later part of puberty boys also go through a strength spurt during which their muscles grow quickly The strength spurt is fastest about a year after the fastest point of the growth spurt By the end of puberty adult males have heavier bones and more muscle than females In an average adult man muscle makes up 50 and fat 15 of his weight On the other hand 40 of an average adult womans weight is made up of muscle while 27 is made up of fat Because men have less body fat than women their hips do not grow bigger Some bones like those in the jaw and shoulders grow more in males than in females That is why males have wider faces and shoulders but narrower hips

The changes in a girls body during puberty usually take place between the ages of eight and 18 years Most girls will have finished puberty around the age of 15 They will have breasts and pubic hair will menstruate every month and will be able to get pregnant They will usually also have reached their full adult height

When the breasts start to grow this is normally the first sign of puberty that can be seen on the outside of a girls body This usually happens when girls are about the age of 105 years A lump that is a bit hard appears in each breast under the areola which is the dark ring around the nipple The lump in one breast may grow before the other one This is called breast budding Within six to 12 months both breasts will have started growing The swelling can be felt and seen outside the edges of the areolae About one and a half to two years after the breasts first start growing they are close to the shape and size of an adult womans breasts The nipple and areola may be on a smaller mound on each breast This small mound usually goes away when each breast is fully grown Whether the breasts are small or large depends on how much fat there is in the body

Between the ages of about eight and 14 pubic hair begins to grow along the labia usually a few months after the breasts start growing At first the hair is thin and straight instead of curly and there is not much of it Within a year the pubic hair becomes rough dark and curly and grows in a triangle shape in the pubic region About one year after pubic hair begins appearing underarm hair also grows The hair on the arms and legs also gets thicker and some girls may have hair appearing on their upper lip and in front of their ears

Like boys higher amounts of hormones in the body cause girls perspiration to change This gives them a more adult body odor or smell The hormones also cause the skin to produce more sebum which usually leads to acne

When girls are between eight and 11 years old the two ovaries in their body begin to grow bigger Each ovary is egg shaped and is attached to the side wall of the pelvis The pelvis is a large set of bones in the hips The ovaries are organs that make female hormones These hormones cause a girl to grow into a woman and make her feel like a woman The hormones also make it possible for females to become pregnant and have babies Inside the ovaries are about 200000 ova For a baby to be formed a womans ovum and a mans sperm must come together During puberty the ova also grow bigger

Between the ages of nine and 15 years the vagina and uterus become bigger The uterus is the organ in which a baby grows The vagina is a tube leading from the uterus to the outside of the body The opening of the vagina is inside the vulva in between the legs A clear or whitish fluid may start to flow out of the vagina to keep it clean Then about two years after the breasts start to grow when a girl is between ten and 16 years old hormones made by her ovaries cause the ovaries to release an ovum which moves into the uterus Usually only one ovum is released at a time The hormones also tell the uterus to get ready for a baby in case the ovum meets a sperm and gets fertilized The walls of the uterus become thicker with extra tissue Inside the thick part of the uterus are blood vessels and other nutrients that a baby will need to grow If an ovum in the uterus gets fertilized it sticks to the wall of the uterus and starts to grow However if the ovum is not fertilized it does not stick The uterus then gets rid of the ovum and the extra tissue by releasing it from the body The tissue and blood flows out of the uterus through the vagina This is called menstruation or having a period The bleeding normally lasts for about three to five days though some girls may bleed for longer or have a bit of bleeding between periods The uterus then starts preparing for another ovum For most girls the time between their periods is about one month For about two years after menstruation starts the time between periods is not always the same Some girls may skip a month or have two periods close to each other It is also normal to have cramps or to feel bloated in the abdomen during periods When many girls start having periods they begin using sanitary napkins or tampons to soak up the blood and tissue A sanitary napkin is a piece of material that is absorbent which is worn between the vulva and underpants A tampon is a stick of absorbent material that is placed inside the vagina

In 2004 a survey by a Canadian magazine found that most females started masturbating when they were about 12 to 13 years old

Because of more hormones in the body girls start to have more fat in their breasts abdomen hips and thighs At the age of ten years the average girl has 6 more body fat than the average boy but by the end of puberty the difference is nearly 50 The fat makes sure that a baby growing inside a pregnant woman will have enough nutrients Also the bones in the pelvis move further apart to make room for a larger uterus and ovaries and so there is space for a baby to grow in the uterus and to pass out of the body when it is born The extra fat and wider hip bones that girls have give them a curvier shape

Girls also experience a growth spurt during puberty In the first year after puberty begins they grow about convert8cmin0abbron They grow even faster the next year or so then the growth slows down and almost stops when they start menstruating After a girls periods begin she usually does not grow more than convert5cmin0abbron taller

The large amounts of hormones in the bodies of boys and girls during puberty can also affect their emotions Young people begin to be attracted by each other and thinking about what it is like to have sex They are often worried about what other people think about them They can also feel an urge to do things that are dangerous such as taking drugs or too many alcoholic drinks or smoking They sometimes want more independence more power to decide things for themselves and can get angry when their parents do not allow them to do things The brains of teenagers are still growing and it may take a while before they are mature enough to know how to make good choices about their lives Therefore it may be helpful for them to follow the advice of adults they trust even if it does not make much sense to them at the time

Because puberty is the time in a childs life when he or she becomes able to make children this is seen as very important Therefore people in many countries around the world have different ways of marking this event

The squid is an invertebrate animal that lives in the ocean They are cephalopod molluscs like octopus are Squid are hunted by some whales most notably the Orca Squid like cuttlefish have eight arms arranged in pairs and two longer tentacles

Sqids are classified in the order Teuthida There are about 300 species 

All squid have tentacles with suckers a mouth with a radula and jet propulsion with the siphon from the mantle The radulla is a scraping organ in the mouth that scrapes nutrients from food sources 

Tentacles are used for locomotive power and capturing food sources All squids are carnivores they eat other animals not plants 

Like other cephalopoda squid are intelligent animals Squids have a head like structure with sense organs and brains in the front end Although the squids lack exterior shells they have a vestigial shell inside made of chitin

The skin is covered in chromatophores which enable the squid to change colour to suit its surroundings making it effectively camouflaged Controlled by the nervous system the camouflage can change in real time 

After a male and female mate the female squid lays eggs The eggs are laid inside an egg case Since the squid is usually a part of a shoal it is laid with many other egg cases from many other squids and then anchored to the sea floor Because of this squid eggs are often found in clumps and those clumps often look like a flower

Often the male will die a short time after mating and the female will die once she has released her eggs Because of this squids usually lay eggs only once Squids do not live very long Although there are some long lived species most squids live for only one or two years

The majority are no more than convert60cmin long although the giant squid may reach convert13mft

In 1978 sharp curved claws on the suction cups of squid tentacles cut up the rubber coating on the hull of the USS Stein The size suggested the largest squid known at the time

In 2003 a large specimen of an abundant but poorly understood species Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni was discovered This species may grow to convert14mft in length making it the largest invertebrate Squid have the largest eyes in the animal kingdom Giant squid are featured in literature and folklore with a frightening connotation The Kraken is a legendary tentacled monster possibly based on sightings of real giant squid

In February 2007 a New Zealand fishing vessel caught a Colossal Squid weighing convert495kglb and measuring around convert10mft off the coast of Antarctica This specimen represents the largest cephalopod to ever be scientifically documented

The giant squid Architeuthis is a genus of deep ocean dwelling squid Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size recent estimates put the maximum size at 13 metres for females and 10 metres for males from caudal fin to the tip of the two long tentacles 

There is a larger squid known as the Colossal Squid 

Until 2005 nobody had ever seen a giant squid that was alive Only dead giant squids had been found On 30 September 2004 researchers from Japan took the first images of a live giant squid in its natural habitat Several of the 556 photographs were released a year later The same team successfully filmed a live adult giant squid for the first time on December 4 2006

There is no agreement as to how many species there are

For many years people would hear stories from fishermen about giant squids at sea According to the stories an enormous squid would wrap its arms around a whale causing a terrible fight to start Whalers said that sometimes when they caught a whale it would have scars as big as dinner plates on its body Other times when they cut open the stomach of some of their whales they would find squid arms as long as 30 ft with suckers up to four inches wide The whalers who told these stories either chopped up the squid parts to eat or use as bait or they threw them back out to sea before scientists were ever able to examine them However in 1861 a French ship was able to bring back parts of a giant squid so scientists could study them 

Then in the late 18th century several giant squids washed up on shore proving that giant squids really exist After that many giant squids were found washed ashore or dead at sea Scientists grew very interested in these mysterious creatures but few ever saw them alive Scientists think they spend most of their time in deep cold ocean

In December 2005 the Melbourne Aquarium in Australia got the intact body of a giant squid preserved in a giant block of ice It had been caught by fishermen off the coast of New Zealands South Island that year

The number of known giant squid specimens was close to 600 in 2004 and new ones are reported each year

The word googol was first used by Milton Sirotta nephew of US mathematician Edward Kasner Sirotta made this word in 1938 for the number represented by the numeral 1 followed by 100 zeros It is said that the word googol was chosen to represent this number because it sounded like baby talk

A googol is 10100

Google was named after the word googol

The National Football League is an American football league There are 32 teams in the league The league is a professional league which means that the players are paid to play and that it is their job A league is a competition between a number of teams The teams play other teams and the results are used to list the teams in order of who is best The team at the top of the list is the best team and the team at the bottom is the worst team 

In 1920 an American football league was formed It was called the American Professional Football Association In 1921 it changed its name to the National Football League In 1960 another league was formed called the American Football League In 1970 the National Football League and the American Football League joined together so that the teams from each league could play each other The league called the National Football League changed its name to the National Football Conference and the league called the American Football League changed its name to the American Football Conference The two conferences together are now called the National Football League People can also call it by the acronym NFL for short

Because the US is a big country and it would be hard for teams to travel a long way to play other teams the teams are separated into smaller regional divisions based on where they are in the country The teams are separated like this Teams in the AFC

Teams in the east

Teams in the north

Teams in the south

Teams in the west

 Teams in the NFC

The teams in the NFL play games against each other from September to January This time is called a season Each team plays 16 games This is how which games a team will play is chosen

Since the 2006 season the NFL has used a flexible scheduling system for the last seven weeks of the regular season where there is a Sunday night game The system is designed so that the league has the flexibility in selecting games to air on Sunday night that will feature the current hottest streaking teams

Under the system all Sunday games in the affected weeks will tentatively have the early start time of 1 pm ET10 am PT except those played in the Pacific or Mountain time zones which will have the tentative start time of 4 pm ET1 pm PT On the Tuesday 12 days before the games the league will move one game to the prime time slot and possibly move one or more 1 pm slotted games to the 4 pm slot During the last week of the season the league could re schedule games as late as six days before the contests so that as many of the television networks as possible will be able to broadcast a game that has playoff implications

At the end of every NFL season the eight teams that finish the season at the top of their leagues and two teams from each conference that were the best teams apart from the eight league winners enter a competition to see who is the best team in the whole league This is called the Playoffs There are a total of 12 teams in the Playoffs six from the NFC and six from the AFC The six teams in each conference are listed in order of how well they played in the season This is called seeding and it is done to make it easier for the better teams to win The teams that did not win their leagues are always the fifth and sixth seeds in the list even if they were better than a team that won a different league

In the first part of the playoffs there are four games

The teams that lose these games are not in the playoffs competition any more Now there are only 8 teams left

In the second part of the playoffs there are four games

The teams that lose these games are not in the playoffs competition any more Now there are only 4 teams left

In the third part of the playoffs there are two games

The last part of the playoffs is called the Super Bowl The AFC Champion and the NFC Champion teams play each other to decide who is the best team in the NFL

The Super Bowl is a special American football game played every year at the end of the National Football League season The best team from each of the two NFL conferences play for the Vince Lombardi Trophy which was named after the first coach to win a Super Bowl For most football fans it is a very special event Some people who do not like football still watch it for the commercials and the half time show The Pittsburgh Steelers are the team with the most Super Bowl Wins with six The San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys currently are tied for the second most Super Bowl wins with 5 The Cleveland Browns Detroit Lions Houston Texans and the Jacksonville Jaguars have never played in a Super Bowl The Kansas City Chiefs and New York Jets have not played in the Super Bowl since the American Football League and the NFL joined together in 1970

The infinitive is a verb form It has no person number mood or tense

In English there are two main forms of the infinitive

After a modal verb you must use an infinitive For example I must go he must go

To express time relationships here are 6 types of infinitives

Cartridge can mean

Some real numbers are positive A positive number is bigger than zero If a positive number is added to another positive number that number gets bigger Zero is also a real number If zero is added to a number that number does not change

There are also negative real numbers If a negative number is added to another number that number gets smaller

The real numbers are infinite There is no smallest or biggest real number No matter how many real numbers are counted the last one will never be reached

The real numbers are dense That means that if two different real numbers are taken there will always be another one in between them no matter how close together the two numbers are

Hermaphrodites are people who have both male and female sex parts Another word for this is intersex Inter means between and sex refers to what sex parts a person has so intersex means between male and female

People who are intersex can look a lot of different ways They may have a very small penis and no testicles or a very small and short vagina and a large clitoris that looks like a penis Sometimes when these people are born it is hard for the doctor to tell by looking if the baby is a boy or a girl

The epididymis is the part of the human male reproductive system It is the tube that holds the testicles in place It stretches from the back of each testicle to the van deferens

When the sperm are ejaculated they move through the tail of the epididymis There are so many sperm that they cannot swim but use peristalsis from muscles in the vas deferens

An injury or infection of the epididymis causes epididymitis a painful condition that can take months to heal Sometimes the testicle has to be removed There does not seem to be any single cause or treatment for this condition Some doctors treat it with antibiotics some take a wait and see attitude At times just one testicle is affected and at others both

Tetris is a video game developed in the Soviet Union in 1984 The goal is to drop blocks called tetrominoes down into a playing field to make lines Tetriminoes are made of four connected squares each and there are seven different shapes of tetrominoes A player uses the tetrominoes to make unbroken lines of squares across the bin from left to right by stacking them in the playing field When a player makes a line it clears After a clear squares over that line fall  As play goes on the tetrominoes fall faster 

Tetris has appeared in many video game systems It has become very common from back when Alexey Pazhitnov first made it in 1984 Over 100 million copies of the game have been sold

The goal is to drop blocks called tetrominoes down into a playing field to make lines Tetriminoes are made of four connected squares each  There are seven different types of tetrominoes  Levels have a set goal or number of lines to clear When the goal number reaches zero the player moves to the next level As the levels go up the tetrominoes fall faster A player receives bonus points if he can clear more than one line with a single tetromino Clearing four lines is called a tetris three lines a triple and two lines a double Clearing two tetrises in a row is called a back to back tetris The player can also turn a T shaped tetromino into a hole called a T slot to get more points This move is called a T spin A player loses when the tetrominoes make it to the top of the playing field See Issues for information on the Level 29 Problem

The first person to find out what the first three messages say was Jim Gillogly He learned the answers in 1999 After he said what the answer was the CIA said that a man who works at the CIA David Stein knew the answer too A few years later the NSA said that they had people who had solved it too

Before he made Kryptos Jim Sanborn had not made any other sculptures with letters on them After Kryptos he made many other sculptures with letters on them Some of them have secret messages One is called Antipodes There are two copies of Antipodes One belongs to a man in California The other is in a museum in Washington DC called the Hirshhorn Museum

An African American generally refers to a person who lives in America and speaks English but whose ancestors were from Africa It could also describe a first generation African immigrant to America

The term is usually associated with black people This is because of many African Americans dark skin Many Africans were brought to the United States as slaves A large amount of the US population is African American Outside of urban areas there is also a wide rural area from Maryland to East Texas that has a lot of African Americans living there

African American refers to a specific range of diverse cultures with a common thread of ethnic connection to Africa This term was created to describe an ethniccultural link to Africa for people who are American much as in the case of Italian Americans Irish Americans or Polish Americans The difference is that Italian Americans and Polish Americans know they are Americans of Italian or Polishdescent 

The African in African American acknowledges the connection to a number of African cultures not one in particular The American shows the nationality and culture of the United States A person born in Nigeria is still Nigerian even if he or she comes to the United States and lives here for the rest of their life If that person wants to say that they are an American citizen they would simply say I am an American citizen His American born children could correctly call themselves Nigerian American OR African American 

In the United States when Americans say African American or Black they are referring to the same people Both terms describe an ethnic group that came to exist in the United States The Africans who were brought to America as slaves were from different nationalities and did not all speak the same language They became a new blended ethnic group with a new language that was not their own English 

With their American born children came the first generation of English speaking African Americans But this development was not the same all over the country For example even today the Gullah People of the Sea Islands off the Carolina and Georgia coasts still speak a language that is a blend of several African languagesThey are the descendants of slaves from different countries in Africa 

In America and from an American point of view the term Black is often applied to other ethnic groups throughout the world who do not necessarily see themselves as Black African American culture was born in the United States and is distinct from any single African culture 

African American is a term that many Black people chose to call themselves because they found the term Negro offensive Negro was a label attached by someone else 

In America there are many immigrants of mixed race that includes African descent like Cape Verdeans Dominicans and Puerto Ricans These groups by and large do not think of themselves as Black or African American and object to these labels 

Many mixed raced Americans also resist pressure to identify themselves as Black or White

The Nobel Prize in Physics is a Nobel Prize in the science of Physics

Some famous winners are

Dynamite is an explosive invented by Alfred Nobel Its main explosive component is nitroglycerin Nitroglycerin is very sensitive to movement It explodes very easily when moved For this reason diatomaceous earth is used to take away this sensitivity In dynamite about one part of four is diatomaceous earth the other three are nitroglycerin A little sodium carbonate is added to stabilise the mixture 

Even though the diatomaceous earth takes away some of the dangers of nitrogycerin there are still problems that the mixture is not stable in damp environments Dynamite that is damp or even wet slowly loses its nitroglycerin The nitroglycerin can accumulate in the envirnoment and explode unexpectedly 

For this reason the formulation was changed Instead of diatomaceous earth gelignite was used to bind the nitroglycerin Gelignite binds the nitroglycerin so that it is no longer able to dissolve in water 

Today dynamite is no longer used commercially It has been replaced by explosives based on ammonium nitrate which use gelignite These explosives are cheaper to produce and easier to handle than dynamite

Dynamite remains popular in movies and cartoons though

The movie starts with Oliver an orange orphan cat who is lost in New York City when a mongrel named Dodger finds him When Oliver gets some sausages for him Dodger leaves the cat behind and runs to the barge of his poor owner Fagin the pickpocketer Inside Fagins barge are four other dogs which he also owns Tito the chihuahua Einstein the Great Dane Rita the afghan hound and the serious bulldog Francis When Oliver breaks in those dogs go into a fit of fighting and confusion over their visitor After Fagin breaks it up he goes outside on a quay only to find out that he must pay his agent Sykes some money within three days In order to get the money Fagin his dogs and Oliver set out into the city streets the next day While the poor man is unlucky trying to sell his useless stuff the animals encounter a limosine that is driven by Winston a butler They put on an act to get his attention In the end Tito gets barbecued after interfering with the limosines dashboard and Jennifer finds the cat who is tangled up in the wires nearby Taking Oliver home at Fifth Avenue she makes friends with him Thus the cat is lucky to be adopted twice in two days The next morning Fagins dogs return in order to get Oliver back to their barge much to the upset of Winston and his pet poodle Georgette But as they do so Oliver feels he cannot fit in with his other friends Yet he is Fagins best hope because of the gold tag on his collar So he writes to the Very Rich Cat Owner at Olivers address in hopes of getting Sykes money faster As Jenny reads that letter after she comes home from school she and Georgette go to the docks to get Oliver Jenny gets him back thanks to Fagin but then Sykes kidnaps her for the sake of the ransom that the pickpocketer has to pay in twelve hours It is up to Fagin and his dogs to save both Jenny and Oliver from the wrath of Sykes and his Dobermans Roscoe and DeSoto

This was the first Disney movie to make heavy use of computer animation since previous movies The Black Cauldron and The Great Mouse Detective used it only for special sequences The CGI effects were used for making the skyscrapers the cars trains tunnels the Brooklyn Bridge and Fagins scooter cart

It was also the first animated Disney movie to create a whole bunch of new sound effects to replace many of their original classic sounds which would be used occasionally in later Disney movies This included some sounds the audience was familiar with for years including Pinto Covigs original Goofy yell However the Disney television animation studio continued extensively using the classic Disney sound effects for several years

Also Lady and the Tramps Jock Trusty and Peggy as well as Pongo from One Hundred and One Dalmatians make cameo appearances during Dodgers Why Should I Worry musical number at the start of the movie

The instrumental score for Oliver Company was composed by J A C Redford and the movies music was supervised by Carole Childs The first song heard in the movie Once Upon a Time in New York City was written by lyricist Howard Ashman Billy Joel in addition to voicing Dodger fittingly performed the characters song in the movie

The track list below represents the 1996 re release of the Oliver Company soundtrack The original 1988 release had the same songs but with the instrumental cues placed in between the songs in the order in which they appeared in the movie Using the numbering system in the list below the order the tracks on the 1988 release would be 1 2 6 7 3 4 5 8 9 10 11

The triple point of water or any substance is the combination of temperature and pressure at which it exists in its solid liquid and gaseous state all at once in equilibrium

The temperature of the triple point of water is a commonly used physical constant which is used to define temperature scales and calibrate temperature measuring systems

By definition the temperature of the triple point of water is 27316 K or 001 C One degree Celsius is defined as 127316th part of the triple point of water This fixes the temperature scale as defined in the ITS 90 which is the international temperature scale of 1990 This scale is developed as a practical approximation of the thermodynamical temperature scale

Frequency is how often an event repeats itself over a set amount of time

In physics the frequency of a wave is the number of wave crests that pass a point in one second

All electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light in a vacuum but they travel at slower speeds when they travel through a medium that is not a vacuum Other waves such as sound waves travel at much much lower speeds and can not travel through a vacuum

Examples of electromagnetic waves are light waves radio waves infrared radiation microwaves and gamma waves

Different types of electromagnetic waves have different frequencies

One way to visualize this is if there were two trains traveling at the same speed but the size of the train cars was smaller on one train than the other If someone picked something that was not moving like a signpost and then counted how many train cars passed the sign post in one second for each train they would know the frequency of cars passing in each train The number and frequency of train cars passing the sign post would be different because the train with smaller train cars would have more train cars passing the sign post in a second than the train with larger train cars Knowing how many cars passed the sign post in one second and knowing the speed of the train one could figure out mathematically the size of each train car for each train

For example if the train was moving at 10 miles per second and 10 train cars passed in one second then each train car would be 1 mile long If the other train was also moving at 10 miles per second and 20 train cars passed in one second then one would know that each train car was 12 of a mile long for that train This example shows that knowing the frequency of an electromagnetic wave gives you the wavelength since all electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light so that c v where v is frequency and lambda is wavelength and c is the speed of light Therefore another way of expressing frequency is to say frequency is c over lambda

A hockey stick is a long wooden pole used to push pass or shoot in the sports of ice hockey and field hockey The art of developing ice hockey sticks is a complex science and has become big business Ice hockey sticks are mostly made of composite materials and they have different flexes meaning some sticks are more flexible than others In ice hockey the end or blade of the stick is normally curved to help the player get better control of the puck and better shots at the goaltender The goaltender has a bigger blade to make it easier to stop shots Players sometimes use hockey sticks to hold back the bodies of other players or to trip or hit them sometimes players who do this get penalties

In field hockey sticks are shorter but the blade is thicker than in ice hockey It is used to move a ball instead of a puck

All the players in both ice and field hockey use hockey sticks

Snoop Dogg is a rapper and actor He is most famous with the West Coast hip hop scene He was born in Long Beach California USA on October 20 1971 The reason why he is called Snoop Dogg is because his mother named him after a character called Snoopy because Snoop Dogg was a fan of the Peanuts cartoon which has the Snoopy character

The Malayan tiger is a new subspecies of the tiger that was discovered in 2004 People used to think they were Indo Chinese tigers But now they have their own subspecies They have the same length and weight as the Indo Chinese tiger They live in southern Malaysia and they are an endangered species

The Caspian tiger is an extinct sub species of the tiger It was the most western sub species of the tiger very close to Europe They became extinct in the 1970s They were found in Turkey Iran Iraq Afghanistan Pakistan Mongolia and a part of Russia

Recent research by scientists looking at the tigers DNA have found that it is almost identical to the Siberian tiger They now believe that the two species of tiger may not have become separate until the 1900s

The Caspian tiger was the second largest of the tiger species It had a smaller muscular body with longer strong legs It had large paws and more claws It had small short ears The color was the same as the Bengal tiger with yellow to gold fur with light to dark brown stripes The chest and stomach area are white with yellow stripes In winter it grew longer fur

A string instrument is a musical instrument that makes sound by vibrating the strings on it There are many types of stringed instruments The most common of these appear in the violin family The violin is a small stringed instrument played with a bow which is usually made of horse hair When the bow is drawn across the strings it creates a vibration You can select what vibration the bow makes by choosing the note on the fingerboard It is tuned with a peg The viola is a very similar instrument aside from some small differences The viola is slightly larger and is tuned to C G D and A instead of the violins G D A and E The cello is a stringed instrument that is played on the bass clef and is much bigger then the violin and it is played differently also The double bass is bigger still and is the lowest of them all

There are also plucked strings the most famous of which would probably be the guitar The guitar was made famous by rock groups like Led Zeppelin and artists like Eric Clapton You play by strumming with one hand while choosing notes on the fretboard with the other Banjos are also very similar

Here is a very basic list of the stringed instruments

Toys originated many years ago Dolls of infants animals and soldiers and toy tools are found in archaeological places The origin of the word toy is not known However it is thought that it was first used in the 14th century

The earliest toys were made from rocks sticks or clay In Ancient Egypt children played with dolls made of clay and sticks In Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome children played with dolls made of wax or terracotta sticks bows and arrows and yo yos When Greek children especially girls became adults it was required to sacrifice the toys to the gods On the eve of their wedding young girls around fourteen would offer their dolls in a temple as a rite of passage into adulthood

An unicorn is a legendary creature It looks like a horse or goat with one single horn on its head The word unicorn means literally one horn It comes from the Latin word unus which means one and cornu which means horn

Unicorns are in many stories from different parts of the world Its blood and horn usually have mystical powers Its horn is said to have power to heal wounds and sickness and to neutralize poison 

In mythology and heraldry unicorn symbolizes innocence purity and feminine power It is often seen as the counterpart of lion which symbolizes the masculine virtues

Darwin is the territorial capital of the Northern Territory in Australia The city has about 105000 people living there The city is named after Charles Darwin although it was named before he became famous for developing the theory of evolution A member of the crew of the ship that started a port there in 1839 named it Port Darwin in honor of Darwin who had sailed on that same ship earlier Most of Darwin has been built since 1974 when Cyclone Tracy ripped through and destroyed the city Since then the city has recovered It is a very important port because it is on the coast closest to Indonesia and the rest of Asia Darwin also has a large military base 

Darwin also has many Indigenous Australians living in the city about 97 of the people This more than any other capital city of Australia

The Northern Territory is a territory of Australia The capital city is Darwin Other large towns in the Territory include Alice Springs Katherine and Tenant Creek

A magazine can also mean a spring loaded container for bullets used in modern guns

A zombie or zombi is a mythical dead person who has returned to life as a walking corpse Mythical things that have been re animated are called undead The Zombie myth came from the Caribbean

Zombies have become very popular in horror movies They are dead creatures that have been brought back to life by science or some spell and eat the flesh or brain of living people

A walking corpse usually called zombie is the name to referred a person that has been long gone but in a certain way can walk think and attack living persons referring such as canibalism A small part of the brain is still in function the heart lungs and all vital organs is remaining in order and the skeleton and muscles can do movement functions as the skin is rotten hair and nails falling apart eyes drizzled in a redyellow living colors blood and scars wide openclothes ripped and with the five senses as feel see smell tast and hear still capting small and tiny vibrations of the outside

A Voodoo sorcerer or bokor can bring dead people back to life The now zombie is under the control of the sorcerer because zombies have no free will The idea of this is that a zombie is a trapped human soul and if a sorcerer can catch it he becomes more powerful

Wade Davis a Canadian ethnobotanist wrote about zombies in two books The Serpent and the Rainbow and Passage of Darkness The Ethnobiology of the Haitian Zombie Davis went to Haiti in 1982 found out and wrote about how a living person can be turned into a zombie by two special powders being rubbed into a wound The first powder brought a death like state because of a certain poison in it called tetrodotoxin At just the right amount it can make a person almost die but not quite The second powder puts the person in a zombie like state where they seem to have no will of their own Many people still do not believe what Davis wrote about but in Haiti lots of people recognized the zombie drugs This could mean that while the drugs could have no physical effect on the person the strong belief may psychologically make them into the zombie they expect

In Mesopotamian mythology Ishtar the goddess of love and fertility once said in anger

In the Middle Ages many people believed that the souls of the dead could come back as ghosts and haunt the living often because of a crime that the living person had committed Sometimes the ghost could actually take on a physical shape and touch or attack things or people

Zombies appear a lot in horror and fantasy films The zombie that is normally seen is a mindless clumsy corpse which eats human flesh Zombies can not be called cannibals because they do not eat each other only humans The first zombie references appeared in the 1600s and have since appeared in lots of films and books

In zombie films zombies are almost always

In common use an orgy is when more than two people have sex together sometimes also called group sex

A Labradoodle is a mixed breed dog created by breeding a Labrador Retriever with a Poodle Labradoodles are now bred worldwideThere are many variations of Labradoodles with the F1b being the most common and was created by StClair Labradoodle Kennelsby crossing an F1 Labradoodle back to a poodleThis is known as a backcross Labradoodle and improves the coat qualities of the breed

Labradoodles are not a considered an official dog breed by most dog expert organizations such as the Fdration Cynologique Internationalealthough the American Kennel Clubhas now created the Canine Partnerscategory to include the Labradoodle and other hybrid breeds for agility and other competitions

Heilongjiang is the northeastern most province in China It is bordered by Russia on the north and east To the south is Jilin province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region lies to the west

The capital and largest city is Harbin There had been a considerable foreign population in the region particularly in Harbin by first the Russians in the late 19th century and then the Japanese in the 20th century

The terrain consists largely of plains and rolling hills with relatively few low mountainous areas The climate is fairly dry with quite cold winters There are some famous winter ice festivals with elaborate snow and ice sculptures

Heilongjiang Province is divided into 12 municipalities and 1 prefecture

Jilin is one of 3 provinces in the far northeastern part of China It is bordered on the north by Heilongjiang province to the west by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and to the southwest by Liaoning province To the east lies North Korea

The capital city of Jilin is Changchun

The terrain and climate are much like that of neighboring Heilongjiang province Also like its neighboring provinces one of the main agricultural products is corn as the climate is too cold for satisfactory rice cultivation

Liaoning is a northeastern province of the Peoples Republic of China The capital city of Liaoning province is Shenyang 

Liaoning province is the south of the 3 provinces which together with the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region form the entire northeastern part of China It is bordered on the northeast by Jilin province and has a coastline along the Yellow Sea to the southeast Hebei province and Beijing within Hebei lie to the southwest

The rat is a small rodent Rats are omnivores they eat anything they find that remotely looks like food Most rats are in the genus Rattus There are about 56 different species of rats 

The best known rats are the Black rat and the Brown rat These two are known as Old World Rats The group has its origins in Asia Most rats are much bigger than their close relatives the Old World mice In the wild they very rarely weigh more than 500 grams though 

Usually rats are bigger than mice Rats are large muroid rodents mice are small ones The muroid family is very large and complex That means that the terms rat and mouse are not specific in a taxonomic way If a large muroid is discovered it will often have rat in its name if it is small it will often be called mouse  this does not mean however that the animals discovered will be part of the genus rattus or mus for mice Examples that illustrate this are the Pack rat and the Cotton mouse

Some people keep rats as a pet They are called fancy rats Most pet rats do not live longer than three years and most wild rats do not live longer than one year

Other mammals are called rat by many people but those are not true rats many are unrelated to the true Old World rat Examples of such false names are the pack rats of North America or the kangaroo rats Some other rats are related to the true rats but are not in the genus Rattus Such an example is the Bandicoot rat Such problem cases are very few in number Many of the untrue rats are endemic to certain regions that is they are only found there Very often they live on islands In many cases these species are also endangered of disappearing This is the case because they face the loss of habitat and they have to fight for resources like food shelter and water with other species like the Black rat or the Polynesian rat

People keep some types of rats as pets called fancy rats Fancy rats are domesticated brown rats People have kept rats as pets since the 19th centuryRats are social and smart animals that can be trained They also like to play with toys Male pet rats are more playful then female pet rats but are also more aggressive Pet rats do not act the same as wild rats They do not have more diseases than other common pets

Pet rats live 2 to 3 12 years Female rats are smaller than male rats and female rats are more active Male rats often have a stronger bond with their owner than female rats Pet rats have been known to laugh when tickled They can be all one color or have spots or other coloring Some rats have no hair These are called hairless rats

Clark University in Worchester Massachusetts was the first to breed a population of domestic white brown rats They did this to study the effects of diets amongst other things

Since then rats have been used in many experiments They have helped scientists get a better understanding of genetics and diseases as well as how certain drugs work 

Laboratory rats have also proved valuable in psychological studies of learning and other mental processes A 2007 study found rats to possess metacognition a mental ability previously only documented in humans and some primates

Domestic rats are very different from wild rats however They are calmer and less likely to bite they can tolerate greater crowding they breed earlier and produce more offspring and their brains livers kidneys adrenal glands and hearts are smaller

Brown rats are often used as model organisms Genetic research is usually done with mice though Rats are more popular for tests relating to intelligence learning and illegal drugs This is mostly because rats have a high intelligence ingenuity aggressiveness and adaptability Their psychology seems to be very similar to human psychology Whole new species and strains of rats have been bred for the use as laboratory animals for example the Wistar rat Much of the genome of Rattus norvegicus has been sequenced

Rats are opportunists If they have the choice between a food that will need a fight to get and another food that will not they take the food that does not need a fight For this reason rats have lived close to humans for a long time Once humans settled down the leftovers of what those humans ate were a source of food for the rats So the rats followed

Rats are present in almost all settlements In cities they often live in the sewers

Many scientiests believe that the Bubonic plague was spread through fleas on rats That form of plague is spread by the microorganism Yersinia pestis which lives on rat fleas These fleas preyed on rats Those rats lived in the European cities of the day The rats themselves died of the plague Some scientists believe that the plague spread faster than the rats Therefore the rats cannot be the prime carrier More research is needed People believe this disease was the Black Death It killed nearly a third of the population of Europe in many epidemics in the Middle Ages

Rats can carry diseases Many times rats living in poor conditions have problems with parasites themselves Few of those diseases can spread to humans though One of those is called Leptospirosis another one is the plague

A spoon is a tool for eating It is usually used for eating foods that are like liquids and it can also be used for stirring Humans use spoons every day Spoons are mostly useful for eating liquids such as soup although some solids are also usually eaten with spoons

There are many different types of spoons There are dessert spoons soup spoons baby spoons teaspoons tablespoons and others There are also spoons that are collector items and are worth a lot of money Some musicians even use two spoons as a musical instrument like a castanet

Spoons have been used as tools for eating since Paleolithic times Prehistoric peoples probably used shells or small pieces of wood as spoons Both the Greek and Latin words for spoon come from the word cochlea which is a spiral shaped snail shell The Anglo Saxon word spon means a chip or splinter of wood

Cutlery are tools used for preparing serving and eating food The most common types of cutlery are knives spoons and forks 

The best quality cutlery is often made of silver though steel is often used In a restaurant they are often served wrapped in a cloth napkin Plastic cutlery is used for eating fast food because it can be thrown away 

In the United States these are more often called utensils They are also often called silverware even when they are not made of silver

A vase is a container often used for flowers They can be made from a number of materials including glass and ceramics Many vases are decorated or painted but some are left plain It sometimes is used for decorations in American and Chinese homes It can be a big part of culture in many countries

Yemen is the origin land of all Arabs in the Middle East In ancient times Yemen was an important center of trade and power Many powerful kingdoms were in Yemen including the Sabaeans Yemen was important in the trade of spices as well It was known to the ancient Romans as Arabia Felix They called it Happy Arabia because the area was so beautiful and powerful

In the 700s Yemenis were among the first to join the new religion Islam Since then Yemenis have been staunch Muslims who were in the forefront of all Islam conquests and Yemenis were the rulers of Islamic Spain for more than 800 years

Today Yemen has over 20 million people Most of them speak Arabic

The sensory system is the way animals find out about their nearby environment To do this they have special devices for collecting data called sense organs The sense organs act as transducers they turn energy from the outside into nerve impulses The information which comes in is then very rapidly processed by the brain The whole arrangement is the sensory system

It is usual to say the sensory system has five senses

Actually there are other senses We have a sense of proprioception which checks our balance Fishes have a sense system which no land animal has It is called the lateral line system This senses movement and vibration in the water pressure and other functions Some fish can sense patterns of electrical current in the water

A huge amount of data comes in from the sensory system About 11 million pieces of information per second is one estimation of which ten million comes from our eyes Of this huge number we only handle about 40 in our conscious mind The rest is handled non consciously

Syndicated means television program being shown on a different television network than the one that first showed the program A syndicated program can also be a program that was not made for a television network These types of programs are made and then sold to many different television stations to be shown

There are different types of syndication

A cartoon is a drawing The word cartoon has been used in several different ways 

Types of cartoons 

The oldest meaning is a drawing that is a full sized design for a finished artwork The cartoon might be a drawing for a painting that was going to be put onto a wall or ceiling in fresco The cartoon would be pinned against the wall and its design marked onto the plastered of the wall Cartoons were also made to design tapestry The most famous cartons are a set by Raphael which show the Life of St Peter The cartoons are in the Victoria Albert Museum The finished tapestries belong to the Vatican and were made for the Sistine Chapel

Political cartoon In the 1700s artists such as William Hogarth often made sets of humorous drawings that were about political subjects such as poverty elections war and riots The drawings were made into prints and were sold cheaply These prints were not called cartoons at that time but they led to the idea of modern political cartoons in newspapers 

Nowadays many newspapers publish a different political cartoon in the paper every day The word cartoon was first used in this way in 1843 in an English magazine called Punch 

A political cartoon does not always show people Sometimes it may show a country as a person an animal a monster or a baby For example Britain might be shown as a woman holding a baby Australia in her arms Russia might be shown as a bear The United States might be shown as a Bald Eagle

Portrait cartoons Political cartoons often showed real politicians or other famous people One way to make these characters easy to recognise was to make some of their features bigger or smaller So if a politician had a round nose and a big chin then the artist would make the nose rounder and the chin bigger There are many modern cartoon artists who do portait cartoons or charicatures

Political cartoons were often drawn to show several different stages of the same story Many of Hogarths famous political cartoons do this From this came the idea of telling funny stories in a series of pictures Comic strips are a type of cartoon that is published in newspapers but they are usually just called comic strips Some of the earliest comic strips are The Katzenjammer Kids and Ginger Meggs Sometimes they represent animals like Garfield Later comic strips from the 1950s onwards show superheros such as Superman and The Phantom 

Comic strips posted on the internet are web comics While most web comics look just like comic strips many web comics use the new technology of the internet Some use animation and sound for special effects Some web comics take up much more space than newspapers want to print and most offer a large collection of earlier strips for new readers so longer stories can be told Many webcomics are published by independent artists

Movie Cartoons 

From the beginning of the movie industry some artists began experimenting with making drawings that seemed to move These moving drawings also became known as cartoons They often depict animals rather than humans They were often just for fun but sometimes particularly during World War II were used for political reasons just like the cartoons in newspapers Walt Disney and Warner Bros both made famous cartoons Famous cartoon characters are Felix the Cat Mickey Mouse Bugs Bunny and Popeye 

At first movie cartoons were quite short When a person bought a movie ticket they would see a news program two or three cartoons in black and white and a movie Walt Disney then got the clever idea of telling a long story as a cartoon The first one that he made was Snow White and the Seven Dwarves Movie cartoons soon became a popular type of entertainment Modern movie cartoons are sometimes created using computer graphics rather than hand drawn cartoons They include Toy Story and Shrek

A whole number with a square root that is also a whole number is called a perfect square The first few perfect squares are 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 121 144 169 196 225

A negative number is a number that indicates an opposite If a positive number is distance above sea level then a negative number is distance below sea level If a positive number is distance up then a negative number is distance down If a positive number is distance to the right then a negative number is distance to the left If a positive number is a deposit to a bank account then a negative number is a withdrawal from that bank account if a positive number is number of minutes in the future then a negative number is number of minutes in the past If a positive number means addition then a negative number means subtraction 

The numbers you are most familiar with the counting numbers 1 2 3 and so on are all positive numbers The positive numbers negative numbers and the number zero taken together are called signed numbers The signed whole numbers are called integers

The number zero is neither positive nor negative Zero is its own opposite so 0 0 That is zero steps to the right is the same as zero steps to the left

A negative number is said to be less than zero

A negative number is written by putting a minus sign in front of a positive number For example 3 is a negative number It is read negative three or minus three and it means the opposite of 3

Negative numbers are left of zero on a number line A number and its opposite are always the same distance from zero The negative number 3 is just as far to the left of zero as 3 is to the right of zero

Sometimes for emphasis we write the pair of opposite number as 3 and 3

A number and its opposite always add to zero The sum of 3 and 3 is 0 We can write this either as 3 3 0 or as 3 3 0 In addition a number and its opposite are said to cancel each other out

When a person or company is in debt people sometimes say they have a negative amount of money Negative numbers are used in accounting and science

A piece of hail is a lump of ice that falls out of a storm cloud About 5000 hailstorms a year in the United States of America make hail 34 of an inch or bigger

A hailstone begins as a small water drop or a round snow broken wikt linkpelletpellet in a cloud The drop grows by collecting many cloud drops The little drop is blown by a strong wind inside the cloud to where it meets with some supercooled water drops These supercooled drops are still liquid water even though the temperature is below freezing When the little drop broken wikt linkcollidecollides with these supercooled drops they join and the little drop has now become a hailstone

The little hailstone is thrown up inside the cloud still collecting other supercooled drops The hailstone gets bigger and bigger until it goes to the top of the cloud Then because there is no more wind it falls back down through the cloud While it is falling it gets even bigger as it bangs into more supercooled drops If it goes down very fast it can hit the earth at up to 90 mph bouncing like popcorn If the hailstone hits dirt it can actually bury itself

The biggest hailstone recorded in the United States weighed 167 pounds and was 55 inches across It fell near Coffeyville Kansas on September 3 1970 The biggest recorded hailstone in the world was 42 pounds It fell in Kazakhstan in Asia

Hailstones are made of many rings of clear cloudy ice The rings show different amounts of freezing on the hailstone The cloudy ice is because it freezes so quickly trapping many small air bubbles The clear rings are made by slow freezing of the water which lets bubbles escape

Hail does a very great amount of damage every year Even small hail with strong winds can crush a field of wheat flat in a few minutes It sometimes breaks windows and can dent cars and roofs Big hailstones can hurt and even kill small animals

Because hail damages crops there has been many efforts to stop hail In the 16th century farmers used to shoot cannons at thunderstorms thinking this would destroy the hail Cloud seeding is the more recent way but it is expensive and we do not know for sure how well it works To this day there is no proved way of stopping hailstorms

The Academy Awards commonly known as the Oscars are the best known movie awards in the United States The awards have been given by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929 Right now the awards ceremony takes place in January at the Kodak Theater in Hollywood

A brake is a device for slowing or stopping a moving machine part The most common brakes are for wheels such as car wheels and bicycle wheels

A bucket is a container with a wide open top and a handle that is mainly used for carrying liquids In some cases solids may also be carried in a bucket

Some buckets are used for work and some more for leisure as seen here A bucket used for work is often made of a strong material such as iron or steel and is used for functions such as carrying coal or soil A bucket used for leisure eg for making sandcastles is normally made of plastic

In rare cases a bucket may be worn as a piece of clothing people may wear a bucket on their heads for humorous reasons Buckethead is a famous example of this

A lightbulb is a device that produces light from electricity when it is turned on It can be a part of a bigger lighting device such as a lamp 

Light bulbs are often used to bring light to a space They can also be used to show information For example many electronic devices have a small bulb that shines to show when the device is on Cars have signal lights to show which way they are turning

Before electricity became available in the late 1800s people used candles and oil lamps for light Lightbulbs were invented earlier that century but improvements by Thomas Edison made them practical for use at that time Some people still use oil and lamps because they do not have electricity

There are three basic kinds of light bulbs incandescent fluorescent and light emitting diodes In some places the word lightbulb only means the incandescent kind 

The incandescent light bulb turns electricity into light by passing the electric current through a thin tungsten wire called a filament The resistance of the filament heats the bulb up Eventually the temperature of the filament rises so high that it glows Incandescent bulbs are filled with a gas often a noble gas like neon or argon to help them last longer

In fluorescent bulbs the electricity passes through gases Fluorescent lightbulbs are more efficient because they use less electricity than incandescent bulbs and also last longer Fluorescent lightbulbs are often tube shaped Electricity passes from the positive end of the tube to the negative end through the gas When the electrons hits a gas molecule the molecule gives off a photon The photons hit the wall of the bulb which is has a layer of substances that glow when hit by photons making light Changing the mixture in this layer can change the exact color of the light made by the bulb

Light emitting diodes are a semiconductor light source LEDs are used as indicator lamps in many devices and are also becoming more common in other types of lights LED bulbs last much longer than either incandescent or fluorescent bulbs

An LED is made of a chip of semiconducting material doped with impurities to create a p n junction Like in any other diode electric current flows easily from one side to the other but not the other way Charge carriers flow into the junction from electrodes with different voltages When an electron meets a hole it falls into a lower energy level and releases energy in the form of a photon

Most lightbulbs fit into a socket Sometimes they are screwed in other times they fit in the socket through a bayonet action where they are pushed and twisted into the socket and held in place by two small pins on the bulb When they break they must be replaced carefully They get very hot when they are turned on and take some time to cool off There is a danger of electric shock from touching the socket

Most lightbulbs are made of glass which means that they are fragile and break easily In incandescent lightbulbs the filament eventually will sublimate and break and the bulb will stop working Because of this lightbulbs may need to be replaced more often than the rest of the device

Margaret Maggie Simpson is a fictional character shown in the animated television series The Simpsons She is a baby

Like most babies Maggie copies what she sees around her She once hit Homer on the head with a mallet shot a suction dart at his picture and attacked him with a pencil in imitation of Itchy and Scratchy Maggie is also very accurate with a gun she shot MrBurns in Who Shot Mr Burns 

During the early episodes Maggies well known feature would be to trip over her clothes and fall on her face causing a loud smack on the floor Throughout the early episodes Maggie fell down 39 times

Maggie was named after Matt Groenings sister Maggie Groening She often sucked on a pacifier and wore a sleep suit like Maggie Groening thought that it would be funny to have a baby character that did not talk and never grew up but showed any emotions that the scene needed

With few exceptions Maggie never speaks but is aware of what is going around her Maggie has spoken in Good Night the first cartoon to air on The Tracey Ullman Show When the rest of the family falls asleep she speaks and her voice is played by Liz Georges

Maggies first word spoken in the normal television show of the series happened in Lisas First Word when she was voiced by Elizabeth Taylor and says Daddy in an empty room Elizabeth Taylor as Maggie was later named the 13th greatest guest spot in the history of the show James Earl Jones who voiced Maggie in Treehouse of Horror V was in seventh place She would later have small sentences in Treehouse of Horror IX voiced by Harry Shearer who used his Kang voice Her squeaks and occasional speaking parts are regularly done by Nancy Cartwright or Yeardley SmithFactdateAugust 2007

Marjorie Marge Simpson is a character in the animated television series The Simpsons The characters voice is done by Julie Kavner Marge is the wife of Homer Simpson and the mother of Bart Lisa and Maggie Simpson She is famous for her very tall blue hair that is shaped into a beehive She also is proud to have never met anyone with taller hair outside Graceland Marge was named after and loosely based on Margaret Marge Groening Matt Groenings mother

Marges image is normally that of a stereotypical sitcom mother who is sometimes seen as an inexperienced person and easy to be fooled Despite having higher morals than most other characters Marge has had her fair share of wild escapades throughout the shows history She was once a police officer in Springfield took treatment for road rage was once sent to jail for shoplifting became a gambling fanatic showed alcoholism was an unwilling participant in a cross country police chase took steroids cheated on a cooking competition and developed amnesia She is also known for her persistent nagging and groaning These are just some of the strange situations in which Marge has found herself She also displays a surprisingly strong will Marge is the only member of the family who normally tries to encourage the family to go to church She also appears to have significant athletic ability in times of imminent danger She can speak two languages fluently one being English and the other in French

Politically Marge supports the Democratic Party She once says that she voted for Jimmy Carter supported the candidacy of their states governor Mary Bailey and also stated to have been really depressed when Lyndon Johnson died

Marge studied to be a painter When she was a teenager she had an huge crush on Ringo Starr and painted a large number of portraits of him She also wrote to him but only received a reply 25 years later His response inspired her to enter an art contest Her portrait of a drunk Homer sleeping on the couch won the competition She was then hired by Mr Burns to do a portrait of him The resulting portrait won even Mr Burns praise a massive feat in itself

Marge also is a very skilled cook She once started a pretzel business which succeeded with the help of the Springfield Mafia She has entered different cooking challenges although situations such as cruel and ruthless competitors and overheated ovens made her to lose and even break or destroy the other competitors too In general she is shown as a very good cook She is especially well known for her pork chops Homers favorite dish

In some episodes Marge is shown being a fairly skilled photographer until she decided to choose Homer over photography

As a teen Marge had her hair long to at waist length which she always wore down but got the idea to wear it in her trademark beehive for senior prom in the episode The Way We Was In the Shary Bobbins episode her hair is shown close to her knees meaning that a lot of hair would be needed to create her tall beehive Marge has admitted that her hair is not really blue but is in fact gray It was revealed by Homer in Secrets of a Successful Marriage that Marge dyes her hair with blue dye 56 Shes been gray as a mule since she was seventeen However it is shown in the episode Fear of Flying that Marges blue hair goes back to when she was a small child Because of her unusually large hairstyle her height is reported to be 86 as noted by Apu in the episode Marge in Chains In The Way We Werent her hair was blue before she met Homer and was dark at one time because of Marge ironing a piece of her hair for a long time In The Simpsons Season Four DVD commentary Matt Groening states that the original idea behind Marges hair was to hide large rabbit ears The gag was intended to be revealed in the final episode of the series but was cancelled early on because of its irregularity

Like most of the other Simpsons characters Marges age changes from time to time throughout the shows history In first season episodes Life on the Fast Lane and Some Enchanted Evening Marge is said to be 34 years old but her age was later changed to 38 possibly because she and Homer attended their twentieth anniversary high school reunion in one episode In the episode Regarding Margie Homer states that Marge is his age meaning she could be anywhere between 36 and 40 years in age

A dining room is a room used for eating and is usually near the kitchen This is to make serving food easier

Usually a dining room will contain a table with a set of chairs normally positioned at the sides and end of a table People often only use their dining rooms now for formal occasions and eating in the kitchen has become more popular

A crown is a type of headdress worn by a monarch They are usually worn when they are crowned or at important occasions Also crowns are now used as a symbol of the monarchy

Some children mainly girls connect flowers in a chain and wear them on their heads as if they were crowns These are called daisy chains and have nothing at all to do with crowns A crown can also be a part of the head

Walter Richard Rudolf Hess was a high ranking Nazi leader and one of Adolf Hitlers closest men He was the third man after Hermann Gring in the Third Reich

Rudolf Hess was born in Alexandria Egypt but moved back to Germany in 1908

He joined the army in World War I and was trained as a pilot He flew to Scotland during World War II and was arrested After the war he was tried at the Nuremberg Trials and sentenced to life imprisonment

He died in the Allied Military Prison Spandau Berlin in 1987 Since 1966 he had been the only prisoner His death was caused by a strangulation cord officials recorded it as a suicide

Quantum entanglement is the name given to the things that a pair of particles do

Sometimes two particles will act together and become a system They behave like one object but remain two separate objects It is as if they now sit on the same teeter totter seesaw No matter how long the seesaw is even if it is one million miles long if one end is down the other end must be up and this happens instantly 

Even though each particle can tell what the other is doing they do not send messages back and forth There are no messages between the particles saying Im going down therefore you must go up and waiting for the particle to receive the message Yet the particles are always connected and can behave as one

Quantum Entanglement is one of the concepts that led Albert Einstein to dislike the theory of Quantum Mechanics Along with his colleagues Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen Einstein used entanglement to try to disprove quantum mechanics Einstein called entanglement spooky action at a distance He tried to show that this weird effect is only a mistake in the math and in the future it will be taken care of with extra hidden variables Years later however John Bell proved with his theorem that entanglement is real and actually happens to tiny particles

Although one can change a particle to try and cause a change in its partner particle it is impossible to control how this change will end up In other words changing one particle will change its partner particle but it is impossible to choose exactly which way you want to influence them Because we cannot control how the changes between entangled particles occur it is impossible to use quantum entanglement to send messages

A bulb is the part of some plants mostly under the dirt that stores food while the plant is resting from growing

Some well known bulbs people grow to use as food are onions and garlic Some bulbs grown for the decorative flowers are the lily tulip and some irises

Some plant storage organs that are similar to bulbs but have different names are tubers corms tuberous roots and pseudobulbs

Wave has several meanings most of which relate to repeating changes

Gluons are what hold quarks together to make bigger particles Gluons carry the strong force between other quarks so it is considered a force carrying particle Photons do the same thing but for the electromagnetic force Also like photons gluons are spin 1 particles and when a particle has spin 1 it is considered a boson

Gluons are hard to study because although they exist in nature all the time they are so small and require so much energy to break them away from quarks that scientists have only been able to find more about them from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN

Myxobolus cerebralis is a small Myxozoan parasite that eats the insides of fish like salmon and trout causing whirling disease 

This is a problem in fish farming and also in natural fish groups In the last 100 years it has spread to most of Europe the United States South AfricaRefBRRange and other countries In the 1980s people found out that M cerebralis needs to live in a worm before it can live in a fishrefMarkiwWorm It infects both the fish and the worm by poking a hole in them and putting part of itself in

Whirling disease hurts young fish the most and can hurt bones and nerves Fish with the disease do not swim very well and they whirl or spin instead of swimming straight This makes it hard for the fish to get food and get away from danger Dealing with M cerebralis costs more money than most other parasites in its group People do not get sick with whirling disease though only fish do

At first people thought that this parasite infected fish brains so they named it cerebralis which means brain related Then people found out that it mostly infects cartilage and bones They tried to change the name but they could notRefBRName Later they found out that other creatures called Triactinomyxon dubium and T gyrosalmowere actually stages of M cerebralis It would be like finding out that caterpillars are really young butterflies even though they look very differentrefKentTriact

Many scientists think of Myxozoans like M cerebralis as animals but books still call them protozoans Peopole are not sure what its related to Under a microscope they look a lot like Cnidarians like jellyfishRefHEMCnidaria but the scientists that look at chemicals and genes think that its closer to other animals called BilateriansrefMonteiroBilateria

M cerebralis has many stages ranging from single cells to bigger spores Scientists have not studied all the stages very well yet 

Triactinomyxon stage The kind of M cerebralis that can attack fish is called a Triactinomyxon and there is a picture of it on the right There are three tails that are each about 200 micrometers long and another piece that is about 150 micrometers long That piece has 64 cells in itRefHEMMorpho There are also three harpoon like weapons that can attack the fishrefMarkiwSize They shoot into the fish making a hole that the 64 cells can go into Those cells make more cells that go to the cartilage near the fishs brainrefMarkiwInfect

The kind of M cerebralis that comes out of fish is called a Myxospore They are sort of round and fat in the middle like a lentil or a convex lens They are about 10 micrometers across and are made of six cells Two are for the harpoon weapons two are for protecting the Myxospore and two are for going into a worm after the weapons make a holeRefHEMMyxo Myxospores from M cerebralis look a lot like Myxospores from other species that are sometimes in fish skin muscle or brains and so its hard to tell them apartrefMarkiwCart

The Bah Faith is a religion started in the 1800s by Bahullh who was born in Tehran Iran Followers of this religion call themselves Bahs The name Bahullh is Arabic for The Glory of God Glory is a word that means importance power and beauty Bahs believe that Bahullh is a representation of God or speaks for God and he shows people Gods importance beauty and brightness

Bahs are monotheists They believe that Bahullh carried a message from God Bahullh said that he was not the only person to carry a message from God and that he was not the last to carry a message from God He taught that the people who started the other major religions also represented and carried messages from God such as Jesus Moses Abraham Muhammad Krishna the Buddha and others He called these people Manifestations of God They believe that the messages from the Manifestations of God get more and more difficult to understand They say the ones that came earlier on had a more simple message than the ones that came later Because God is greater than the whole universe Bahullh said that human beings cannot completely know God He said that God wants people to know as much about him as they can Bahullh wrote that God sends special people to manifest himself to ordinary humans Without the Manifestations of God we could not know God Because Bahs believe that the God they pray to is the same God that Abraham spoke toJesus talked about and Krishna said in Gita Since Bahullh was born in a Muslim family people mistake bahais as Muslims Bahullh is considered the prophetmanifestationavatar of the present day Bahs say that he is not the last prophetmanifestationavatar of God They think there will be more in the future but there will be no more until 1000 years after Bahaullahs death

The Bah Faith began on 1844 when a man called the Bb said he had a message from God He said that it was his job to make sure that people were ready for the most important message from God who would be sent soon This started a religion followers of this religion were called Bbs Many people became Bbs in the country of Iran which was called Persia at the time and this made the government of Persia and the Muslim priests angry They arrested and killed the Bab and his followers Even though this happened people still followed this religion

Before Bahullh said he had a message from God he was a member of the religion that was started by the Bb He became very famous among the Bbs When the Bb was killed some Bbs got very angry and tried to kill the king of Persia even though Bahullh told them not to kill him When the Babis were caught the government put many Bbs in jail including Bahullh While in jail at Tehran Bahullh said he saw an angel that he called the maid of heaven The angel told him that he had to teach a message from God to the people of the world The angel said that God would rescue and protect him so that he could teach this message Eventually he was released from jail and the government of Persia made him move to Baghdad which was then controlled by the king of the Ottoman Empire

While Bahaullah was in Baghdad he had many problems but he also made many friends The government of Persia was unhappy that he seemed to be doing well in Baghdad and so they asked the Ottoman Empire to move him further away from Persia When he was about to leave in 1863 he held a festival for 12 days on a small island in the Tigris river which he called Ridvan which means paradise There he told some of his closest friends and family that he was the promised one of all of the major religions and that eventually the whole world would know his message

Eventually the Ottoman Empire sent him to many different cities including Constantinople Adrianople Alexandria and eventually Akka He was in different jails this whole time and the city of Akka had a big wall around it and it was one big jail While he was in Baghdad and after he wrote many books and letters to answer questions that his friends and followers asked him At one point he was poisoned so that he could not write anymore because his hands shook so badly After that he had someone write down what he said When he was even older his oldest son Abdul Bah arranged to have him move into a house near Mount Carmel and he stayed there until he finally died in 1892

After he died people followed Abdul Bah Bahullh had written that Abdul Bah had special powers and that God would make sure that if Abdul Bah explained anything that Bahullh said then the Bahs should believe that explanation Abdul Bah also wrote a lot of letters and gave talks and eventually visited Paris London Montreal New York City San Francisco and other cities in the west This helped the Bah Faith to spread in Europe and North America He died in 1921 He left a will where he told the Bahs to follow his grandson Shoghi Effendi

Shoghi Effendi was born in 1900 and was only a young man when his grandfather died and he became the leader of the Bahs He helped make the different agencies and councils that run the Bah Faith today and organized the religion in many ways He also wrote many books and letters to explain the teachings of his grandfather and great grandfather He lived until 1957 and died in England

After Shoghi Effendi died the Bahs did not have leaders for six years because Shoghi Effendi had not left a will Shoghi Effendi did have helpers who did not think they were allowed to lead the Bahs so they helped the Bah Community follow the last plan that Shoghi Effendi left them and at the end of that plan in 1963 they organized an election to form the Universal House of Justice which Bahullh wrote about The Universal House of Justice has led the Bahs ever since

Bahullh wrote many books and letters and Abdul Bah also wrote many books and letters which Bahs see as special Finally Bahullhs great grandson Shoghi Effendi wrote lots of books and letters which Bahs use to better understand the writings of Bahullh and Abdul Bah

Bahs also believe that the Bible the Quran the Gita and other books from other religions are special

Some important Bah beliefs are

There are eight or nine million Bahs in the world of all peoples and languages The Bah Faith looks different in different countries because there are few rituals so Bahs can include their own culture in the way they celebrate Bah events say prayers etc

Bahs meet every nineteen days in a meeting called a Feast There does not have to be food but there usually is These meetings start with prayers and usually someone reads aloud some holy writings Sometimes there is music and song sometimes plays sometimes just quiet time or meditation After this time which Bahs call the devotional time in a feast they have a community discussion All sorts of topics can be discussed here that are important to the members Bahs say that this is a consultative time where Bahs can consult with each other After this there is a social time where people can share food drink and sometimes here there is also music or plays or presentations or other entertainment This time is just so that the Bahs in that city can get to know each other and become better friends

Bahs often do not have one place they get together except in large cities In smaller places they usually get together in each others houses Some larger cities have Bah Centers which can be used for community meetings classes or for meetings of committees and other councils 

In a very few cities in the world there are Bah temples These temples are on each continent 

Bahs are organized in a worldwide community They do not have priests Everyone is responsible for their own prayers Bahs are also responsible for reading their holy books for themselves and for learning about their religion Bahais elect leaders for their community to help organize their activities and to deal with problems between members and to decide things that are not obvious from the scriptures These are called Spiritual Assemblies but will one day be called Houses of Justice 

There is one House of Justice which Bahs call the Universal House of Justice which leads the whole worldwide Bah community Bahs elect this House of Justice every five years but only once each year for National and Local Spiritual Assemblies

Neoclassical economics is an economic theory that argues for markets to be free This means governments should generally not make rules about types of businesses businesses behaviour who may make things who may sell things who may buy things prices quantities or types of things sold and bought The theory argues that allowing individual actors freedom creates better economic outcomes These outcomes may be a higher average standard of living higher wages better average life expectancies and higher GDP 

Markets are an abstract idea assumed to be all the actors selling one thing service or type of thing or service and all the actors buying it 

Markets will reach equilibrium if all the sellers who want to sell at or below a given price have sold to all the buyers who are willing to buy at or above a given price the price is worked out in the market

It may be easier to think about this in reverse The market is not in equilibrium if people want to buy a haircut for ten pesos and someone is happy to sell the person a haircut for ten pesos but for some reason this does not happen 

Neoclassical economists say this will not happen Neo Keynesians say it might so the government could make the customer and the person selling the haircut happier by helping the customer somehow

Neo Keynesian economy is the opposite of Neoclassical economy The major point of difference between neoclassical economics and neo Keynesian economics is about whether markets reach equilibrium 

The Nile is a river in Africa It is the longest river on Earth and flows into the Mediterranean Sea near Alexandria It gets its name from the Greek word Nelios

The White Nile flows from Lake Victoria in Uganda and through Sudan to Khartoum where it is joined by the Blue Nile to form the Nile then through Egypt The Blue Nile flows through Ethiopia About 300 million cubic metres of water flow down the Nile each day

The Nile is very important to the countries where it flows Many cities in Egypt are built next to the river Also the pyramids are close to the Nile The Nile provides most of the water used to grow crops in Egypt since much of the rest of the country is in a desert The Nile was very important to Ancient Egyptians The Ancient Egyptians got papyrus from the Nile

There are many different types of animals living in or near the waters of the Nile including crocodiles birds fish and many others Not only do animals depend on the Nile for survival but also people who live there need it for everyday use like washing as a water supply keeping crops watered and other jobs

Pyramids were built close to the Nile because they needed the granite stones from Aswan to be transported by barges down the Nile

The word Nile comes from Greek Neilos Nobody knows where the Greek Neilos came from In the ancient Egyptian language the Nile is called p or iteru meaning great river represented by the hieroglyphs shown on the right In Coptic the words piaro or phiaro meaning the river come from the same ancient name

A Statue is a model of somebody or something usually of a person or sometimes an animal It is a sculpture Several kinds of material can be used to make a statue eg stone bronze clay or wood Statues are often at least life size but often they are much bigger especially statues in the open air Statues are often made to remember an important person or to remember an event or an idea

Usually there is some writing on a statue to say who the person is This writing is called an epigraph The statue may be standing on a base This base is called a plinth

A bust is a statue of the head shoulders and upper body of a person

A colossus is an enormous statue

The City and Borough of Juneau is a unified municipality on the Gastineau Channel in the panhandle of the US state of Alaska It has been the capital of Alaska since 1906 when the government of the then District of Alaska was moved from Sitka as dictated by the US Congress in 1900 The municipality unified in 1970 when the city of Juneau merged with the city of Douglas and the surrounding Greater Juneau Borough to form the current home rule municipality

The area of Juneau is larger than that of Rhode Island and Delaware individually and almost as large as the two states combined Downtown Juneau coord581807N1342511Wscale10000 is nestled at the base of Mount Juneau and across the channel from Douglas Island As of the 2010 census the City and Borough had a population of 31275

Downtown Juneau sits at sea level with tides averaging convert16ftm0 below steep mountains about convert3500ftm 2 to convert4000ftm 2 high Atop these mountains is the Juneau Icefield a large ice mass from which about 30 glaciers flow two of these the Mendenhall Glacier and the Lemon Creek Glacier are visible from the local road system the Mendenhall glacier has been generally retreating its front face is declining both in width and height

The Alaska State Capitol in downtown Juneau was originally built as the Federal and Territorial Building in 1931 Prior to statehood it housed federal government offices the federal courthouse and a post office It also housed the territorial legislature and many other territorial offices including that of the governor Today it is still the home of the state legislature and the offices of the governor and lieutenant governor Other executive branch offices have largely moved elsewhere in Juneau or elsewhere in the state in the ongoing battle between branches for space in the building as well as the decades long capital move issue Recent discussion has been focused between relocating the seat of state government outside of Juneau and building a new capitol building in Juneau Neither position has advanced very far The Alaska Committee a local community advocacy group has led efforts to thus far keep the capital in Juneau

Long before European settlement in the Americas the Gastineau Channel was a favorite fishing ground for local Tlingit Indians known then as the Auke and Taku tribes who had inhabited the surrounding area for thousands of years The native cultures are rich with artistic traditions including carving weaving orating singing and dancing and Juneau has become a major social center for the Tlingit Haida and Tsimshian of Southeast Alaska

The first European to see the Juneau area was Joseph Whidbey master of the Discovery during George Vancouvers 1791 95 expedition who explored the region in JulyAugust 1794 Early in August he saw the length of Gastineau Channel from the south noting a small island in mid channel He later saw the length of the channel again this time from the west He said it was unnavigable being filled with ice

The town was originally called Harrisburg after Richard Harris some time later its name was changed to Rockwell after Lt Com Charles Rockwell In 1881 the miners met and renamed the town Juneau after Joe Juneau In 1906 after the diminution of the whaling and fur trade Sitka the original capital of Alaska declined in importance and the seat of government was moved to Juneau Juneau was the largest city in Alaska during the inter war years passing Fairbanks in the 1920 census and displaced by Anchorage in 1950

In 1911 the United States Congress authorized funds for the building of a capitol building for the Alaska Territory Because of World War I construction was delayed also there were difficulties purchasing the necessary land Local citizens of Juneau donated some of the required funds and construction began on September 8 1929 Construction of the capitol took less than two years and the building was dedicated as the Federal and Territorial Building on February 14 1931 The design of the building was drawn up by Treasury Department architects in the Art Deco architectural style The building was originally used by the federal government in order to house the federal courthouse and post office Once Alaska gained statehood in 1959 the building has been used by the state government

Robert Atwood then publisher of the Anchorage Times and an Anchorage booster was an early leader of a group that has tried to move the capital to Anchorage Many people in both Juneau and Fairbanks have fought the proposal One provision required the new capital to be at least convert30mikm from Anchorage and Fairbanks to prevent either city from having undue influence in the end Juneau remained the capital In the 1970s voters passed a plan to move the capital to Willow a town convert70mikm north of Anchorage But pro Juneau people there and in Fairbanks got voters to also approve a measure requiring voter approval of all bondable construction costs before building could begin Alaskans later voted against spending the estimated 900 million A 1984 ultimate capital move vote also failed as did a 1996 vote

So Alaskans voted several times on moving their capital but Juneau remains the capital Once Alaska was granted statehood in 1959 Juneau grew with the growth of state government Growth accelerated remarkably after the construction of the Alaska Pipeline in 1977 the state budget being flush with oil revenues Juneau expanded for a time due to growth in state government jobs but that growth slowed considerably in the 1980s The state demographer expects the borough to grow very slowly over the next twenty years Cruise ship tourism grew rapidly from about 230000 passengers in 1990 to nearly 1000000 in 2006 as cruise lines built more and larger shipseven mega ships sailing to Juneau seven days a week instead of six over a longer season but this primarily summer industry provides few year round jobs Its population rank in 2000 was second in the state closely ahead of Fairbanks recent estimates have Juneau falling back to third as it was in the 196090 counts

The Venus Flytrap Dionaea muscipula is a carnivorous plant Carnivorous plants grow in soil that has little nitrogen They receive nitrogen from the insects they trap

The Venus Flytrap is one of a very small group of plants capable of rapid movement When an insect or spider crawls along the leaves and touches a hair the trap closes only if a different hair is contacted within twenty seconds of the first touch The two touch trigger avoids wasting energy on objects with no food value

The Venus flytrap is a small plant with small leaves Its clam shaped leaves are a flower mimic when open they show red and smell sweet They have bristles on each edge Inside the leaves there are very sensitive tiny hairs which cause the leaves to snap shut when it is touched Two hairs must be touched to make the response and close the leaves This makes it more likely that the thing that touched its hair is living

The Venus Flytrap feeds on insects such as ants beetles woodlice worms flies grasshoppers and moths First it traps the insect inside its leaves and then lets out a liquid that helps digest the trapped animal The plant takes the nitrogen from the insects body and consumes the insect

The Venus flytrap makes its own sugar by photosynthesis The flies give it nutrients which it cannot get from the waterlogged soil With the nutrients it can build up enzymes and other molecules which need trace elements as well as sugars and amino acids

Venus fly traps were first discovered in North America on the coast of North and South Carolina where it grows wild near the Cape Fear River But people anywhere can grow Venus Flytraps in pots There is a pretty sizable market for venus fly traps between collecters The name is sometimes spelled Venus flytrap Venus flytrap or Venuss flytrap It is named after the roman god of love Venus

A prime number is a natural whole number that has exactly two distinct whole numbers that divide it with no remainder These divisors are the number itself and 1

For example 7 is a prime number because the only numbers that divide it evenly are 1 and 7 91 is not prime because 1 7 13 and 91 all divide it 1 is not a prime number since there is only one number that divides it with no leftover

All natural numbers that are not prime are called composite numbers

There is no biggest prime number as there are infinitely many prime numbers The way they are placed among all whole numbers is not understood very well although mathematicians have some understanding of it See the Prime number theorem

There is a simple method to find a list of prime numbers It was created by Eratosthenes and has the name Sieve of Eratosthenes because it catches some numbers that are not prime and the rest of them that can get through are prime 

The method is always the same

As an example if this is done up to the number 10 the numbers 2 3 5 and 7 are prime numbers and 4 6 8 9 and 10 are composite numbers

This method or algorithm takes too long to find very large prime numbers But it is less complicated than methods used for very large primes like Fermats primality test or the Miller Rabin primality test

Prime numbers are very important in mathematics and computer science Some real world uses are given below Very big prime numbers are hard to find so most of the time numbers that are probably prime are usedFactdateApril 2009

An igloo is a shelter made from blocks of snow placed on top of each other often in the shape of a dome They were used in winter as temporary shelters by hunters when they were away from their regular homes

They were most often built in places where a lot of snow covers the land for weeks or months at a time such as the far north of Canada and Greenland Most igloos are built by native Inuit people As they learned to build them better sometimes people would build larger igloos that would last longer and hold more people even for dancing

A spore is the way fungi and some non flowering plants such as ferns and mosses reproduce the same way seeds of other plants do

Fungi produce spores which may be asexual or sexual The asexual spores have inside them the genetic material to make a whole new organism identical to its parent 

Conidia are asexual non motile spores of a fungus they are also called mitospores due to the way they are generated through the cellular process of mitosis They are haploid cells genetically identical to the haploid parent can develop into a new organism if conditions are favorable and serve in dispersal

Asexual reproduction in Ascomycetes is by the formation of conidia which are bourne on specialized stalks called conidiophores The morphology of these specialized conidiophores is often distinctive of a specific species and can therefore be used in identification of the species

Bacterial spores are extremely resistant Spores of tetanus and anthrax for example can survive in the soil for many years The origin of these spores was discovered in the 19th century when a biologist noticed under the microscope a small round bright body inside bacterial cells This survived even when the bacteria were boiled for five minutes This killed the bacteria but not the spores They germinated when conditions were rightp186

The band has five members and three of them play guitar In their early years Radiohead was known for their layered and heavy guitar sound In later years the band began using other instruments too and creating more electronic sounds The band still performs live and attracts large crowds of fans to sold out concerts even though they play many different styles of music

Most bands from England are not successful outside their home country of the UK But Radiohead is successful in the UK and also in Europe the United States Canada Latin America Australia Israel Japan and other parts of Asia Radiohead does not sell as much as the biggest pop artists in the world but they are recognized by fans and music critics Lots of people and magazines have called their albums some of the best ever made They have made eight albums so far the latest The King of Limbs was released in 2011 The band also works to help environmental and peace causes

Radiohead started in 1987 The members of the band went to school together at Abingdon School a school only for boys in Abingdon The band first called themselves On a Friday The band would usually rehearse on Friday in their schools music room 

On A Friday signed a contract with EMI a large record label in 1991 They changed their name to Radiohead This name came from the song Radio Head on the album True Stories by Talking HeadsThey released their first EP called Drill in May 1992 It was not very popular Radiohead started work on their first album It was called Pablo Honey and it was recorded in 1992 in a studio in Oxford They released their first single Creep late in 1992 They released Pablo Honey in February 1993 The album did not become popular but Creep did and the band got a lot of fans because of it At the time Radioheads style of music was not very popular and people said it sounded like Nirvana but was not as good They said that other Britpop bands like Suede were better Creep was played on the radio at a lot of colleges around the world however When Radiohead went on tour in the United States in early 1993 the music video for Creep was being played a lot on MTV

Radiohead made an EP in 1994 This was called My Iron Lung and contained the title single and seven songs known as B sides The main song My Iron Lung was about the way fans had reacted to their song Creep The band was happy the song had been a hit because otherwise they might not have been able to continue the band But the band especially Thom Yorke were reluctant to be celebrities They were already disturbed by the workings of the music industry They felt they had no control over things Creep was popular so they felt under pressure to make more similar songs They hated the way Creep was the only Radiohead song anyone listened to at their concerts yet it was all that was keeping them popular and afloat in the record industry The iron lung was a metaphor for such a life support

Their second normal album The Bends came out in 1995 The song My Iron Lung was on it along with 11 new ones The band released four more songs as singles Fake Plastic Trees High and Dry Just and Street Spirit Fade Out None of these songs were as popular as Creep around the world Radiohead was now a one hit wonder to many people in America Songs from The Bends did not get played on the radio very much there But the album became very popular in Radioheads home of the UK It also got excellent reviews from music critics unlike the bands first album Many said it was one of the best rock records in memory The album was produced by John Leckie a veteran at EMIs Abbey Road studios As a young man Leckie had assisted on Pink Floyd albums in the 1970s

The bands lineup was the same for The Bends Thom Yorke and Ed OBrien played rhythm and auxiliary guitar Thom sang and Ed sang backup Phil Selway played drums and percussion Colin Greenwood played bass guitar Radioheads lead guitarist was Jonny Greenwood Colins younger brother Jonny was also younger than any of the other members Jonny was the only member of the band who did not graduate from university He was also the only member who had attended music school Jonny had had to leave university after a few months to join Radiohead on a tour when they became popular But he played in an orchestra when he was young and he had a knowledge of classical and experimental music and jazz Thus Jonny became the bands musical expert At this stage he already played many instruments such as keyboard

It was Jonnys complex and cathartic guitar solos in songs like Just and The Bends that soon began to attract notice So did his simpler playing in other songs The circle of Radiohead fans began to grow Thom Yorkes lyrics also began talking about larger more political themes during this time Mostly they were still about personal disappointments loves losses depression unease and anger But Thom wrote songs like Fake Plastic Trees and Street Spirit which found the source of the unease in the larger structure of society not the individual

Radioheads style of music had gotten more mature according to most people without changing too much Some others felt their songwriting had improved so much it was no longer unrecognizable The band used more keyboards and acoustic guitar this time and made a more subtle atmosphere But electric guitars were the main instrument used on the record Some of Radioheads influences this time were the post punk band Magazine the singer songwriter Jeff Buckley Morrisseys Vauxhall I and the music of REM That band had inspired Radiohead from the beginning Radiohead would get a chance to tour with them in summer 1995 after releasing the album Lead singer Michael Stipe became a friend and mentor to Thom and also a public fan of Radiohead In 1995 he said theyre so good theyre scary

The bands influences had expanded once more by the time of their next album OK Computer

With OK Computer the band started the next section of their career They started using more sounds from electronic music They released the album Kid A which had a lot less use of guitar than on previous albums but was still called one of their best albums An album of songs recorded during this time but that did not appear on Kid A was released called Amnesiac In 2003 they released the album Hail To The Thief which was a return to a sound with more guitars and less use of electronic sounds In 2008 they released In Rainbows It was first released for free on the bands website then released properly on January 1 2008

The Flag of Greenland was designed by Greenlander Thue Christiansen It features two equal horizontal bands of white and red with a large disk at the center The top half of the disk is red the bottom half is white 

Its local name in the Greenlandic language is Erfalasorput which means our flag but Aappalaartoq is also used for both the Greenlandic flag and the Dannebrog Today Greenlanders display both the Erfalasorput and the Dannebrog often side by side

Greenland first thought of the idea of a flag of its own in 1973 when five Greenlanders proposed a green white and blue flag The following year a newspaper printed eleven design proposals and polled the people to determine the most popular The Dannebrog was better liked than any Little came of this effort

In 1978 Denmark granted home rule to Greenland making it an equal member of the Danish Kingdom The home rule government asked for flag proposals receiving 555 293 were made by Greenlanders 

Out of all the designs the current red and white design by Christiansen narrowly won over a green and white Nordic cross by a vote of fourteen to eleven Christiansens red and white flag was officially adopted on June 21 1985

To honor the tenth anniversary of the Erfalasorput the Greenland Post Office issued commemorative stamps and a leaflet by its creator He described the white stripe as representing the glaciers and ice cap the red stripe the ocean the red semicircle the fjords and the white semicircle the icebergs and pack ice The design is also reminiscent of the setting sun half submerged below the horizon and reflected on the sea

Greenlandic can be divided into three dialects

Kalaallisut or in English Greenlandic is the name given to the standard dialect and official language of Greenland This standard national language is now taught to all Greenlanders in school regardless of their native dialect It reflects almost exclusively the language of western Greenland and has borrowed a great deal of vocabulary from Danish while Canadian and Alaskan Inuit languages have tended to take words from English or sometimes French and Russian It is written using the Roman alphabet The dialect of the Upernavik area in northwest Greenland is somewhat different in sound from the standard dialect

A worm is an invertebrate animal with a long body and no legs The most common worm is the earth worm a type of annelid In some countries people eat earthworms

There are over 5500 known species of worms They can be found everywhere except in polar or dry climates Their size varies they can be between two centimeters and about three metres in length The biggest known earthworm is the Giant Gippsland Earthworm one of about 1 000 earthworm species found in Australia They are usually about 80cm in length but can grow to about 3 metres Some other worms are Tapeworm and Ringworm Both of those worms are parasites

The most common earthworm can grow to a size of about 20 25 cm when extended

Most earthworms can regrow lost segments This capability varies by species though

Long ago all animals looking like worms were lumped together by John Ray and by Linnaeus in their classifications Later biologists found that some were in quite different groups and so now the term worm is only used for annelids Roundworms and flatworms are different phyla Inchworms are a type of caterpillar and the slow worm is a legless lizard

An earthworm has a pointy head and small mouth The colour of an earthworm can be brown pink or red Earthworms have a long body They look squishy and gushy and slimy but they are not They have tiny hairs called bristles Earthworms have ringed segments They have a saddle where it lays its eggs Earthworms have 5 pairs of hearts It has no thorax or abdomen

Earthworms live in dark damp soil They live in vegetable peels They also live in meadows and dead plants Earthworms live in gardens They live under rocks Earthworms live in wet woods They also live in damp grass

Despite the fact that worms are both male and female they still need a partner to reproduce They will find another worm and transfer sperm to the egg by wriggling against each other till the spot where the egg is and the sperm is thus fertilizing the egg The egg is then laid When the egg hatches the worms inside will come out and grow until they can mate which takes about 6 weeks

Earthworms eat soil and rocks The rocks they eat are tiny and earthworms crush and grind them with their guts They eat oatmeal Earthworms eat roots Earthworms eat compost and also dead plants An earthworm has enemies like hedgehogs birds and snakes Their defenses are camouflaging Camouflage means you cannot see it because it is the same colour as its background

New South Wales is one of the states of Australia It the oldest state in Australia and is sometimes called the Premier State Of all Australian states New South Wales has the most people An inhabitant of New South Wales is referred to as a New South Welshman The capital city of New South Wales is Sydney Sydney is the biggest city in Australia 

The name New South Wales came from the journal of Lieutenant James Cook who sailed up the east coast of Australia in 1770 He thought that the land looked like the south coast of Wales He named it New Wales but then changed the name in his journal to New South Wales

New South Wales was founded in 1788 by the British who set up a small colony which became known as Sydney Town and grew into the city of Sydney The British colony of New South Wales originally included more than half of the Australian mainland as well as New Zealand Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island During the 19th century large areas were separated to form the British colonies of Tasmania South Australia Victoria Queensland and New Zealand

New South Wales has four main geographical areas

The state is bordered on the north by Queensland on the west by South Australia and on the south by Victoria Its coast faces the Tasman Sea New South Wales contains two Federal Territories the Australian Capital Territory and the Jervis Bay Territory

New South Wales three big cities are Sydney Newcastle and Wollongong which all lie along the coast Other settlements include Albury a large town which borders with Victoria Broken Hill the most westerly large town Dubbo Orange Bowral Bathurst home of the Bathurst 1000 Port Macquarie Tamworth home to the country music festival Armidale Inverell Lismore Nowra Gosford Griffith Queanbeyan Leeton Wagga Wagga Goulburn where a lot of Australias fruit is grown and Coffs Harbour a popular tourist destination 

The population of New South Wales at the end of June 2007 was 689 million people Population grew by 11 over the preceding year lower than the national rate of 15

Hemp is a plant and the fibers made from it It is a subspecies of the Cannabis sativa plant It is usually used to make cloth and other textiles and ropes

Hemp is one of the oldest plants humans have grown and used Hemp was domesticated in Asia over 10000 years ago It was already used to make clothes ropes and an early form of paper The seeds were eaten and the plant had medicinal uses From there the use of hemp spread In Europe hemp was at least used 5500 years ago It is one of the earliest domesticated plants recorded It is quite strong and does not need many pesticides and no herbicides Linen and hemp were the most important fiber plants in Europe for a long time

The lung is an organ in many vertebrates It gives blood oxygen from the air and takes away carbon dioxide Most vertebrates have 2 lungs

In animals the lungs are the area where gas exchange takes place Without gas exchange oxygen would not pass into the blood from the lungs The body cells would not be able to receive the oxygen needed for respiration A lung is made up tubes that connect to millions of tiny air sacs called alveoli 

The alveoli are moist to allow oxygen to move from the lung through the alevoli into blood vessels and red blood cells Carbon dioxide passes from the blood into the alveoli The oxygen filled blood goes back to the heart and the carbon dioxide in the alveoli is pushed out of the lungs and into the air we breathe out

Birds lungs do not have alveoli instead they have millions of para bronchi These para bronchi end up in tiny capillaries or very small blood vessels and they pass close to the bodys blood vessels so diffusion can occur and the oxygen and carbon dioxide is exchanged The oxygen and carbon dioxide in birds lungs continuously be diffused into and out of the blood not like mammals where diffusion can only happen in the alveoli

Reptile lungs open and close because of the ribs surrounding them pressing down on them and then opening up with the help of muscles The liver is also attached to the bottom of the lungs and when a muscle which is attached to the liver pulls the liver moves away from the lungs and pulls them making them bigger

Frog lungs are very simple compared to most other lungs they are simply balloons with moist outsides allowing for diffusion But frogs do not move around much and so do not need lots of oxygen but they can also take in oxygen through their moist outer skin if a big demand of oxygen is needed

Kansas City is the name of two cities in the United States of America

Musically rock uses the electric guitar as part of a rock group with bass guitar and drums Rock music is song based It has a 44 beat and it has verse chorus form However rock has become very different and it is hard to say what its common musical instruments are Like popular music rock music lyrics are mostly about romantic love They can also have social or have political themes however Nearly all rock musicians are white male people Rock focuses on musical skill live performance and it tries to be more real than pop music

By the late 1960s a number of different rock music below genres had come out These included hybrids like blues rock folk rock country rock and jazz rock fusion Many of these contributed to the development of psychedelic rock influenced by the counter cultural psychedelic scene New genres that came from this scene included progressive rock glam rock and heavy metal Progressive rock made the music more artistic Glam rock focused on showmanship and what you can see Heavy metal which focused on loudness power and speed In the second half of the 1970s punk rock both intensified and reacted against some of these trends to produce a raw energetic form of music characterized by overt political and social critiques Punk caused other below genres to come about into the 1980s including New Wave post punk and eventually the alternative rock movement From the 1990s alternative rock began to be the most popular type of rock music It broke through into the mainstream in the form of grunge Britpop and indie rock More merging of below genres have since emerged These include pop punk rap rock and rap metal as well as conscious attempts to revisit rocks history including the garage rockpost punk and synthpop revivals at the beginning of the new millennium

Time dilation is a physics concept related to relativity and special relativity 

So approximately 709 years will pass on earth for each year in the spaceship

In ordinary life where people move at speeds much less than the speed of light even considering space travel are not great enough to produce easily detectable time dilation effects and such vanishingly small effects can be safely ignored It is only when an object approaches speeds on the order of 30000 kms that time dilation becomes important

However there are practical uses of time dilation One such example is with regard to keeping the clocks on GPS satellites accurate Without accounting for time dilation GPSes would be useless

The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest court in the United States of America Because of this the Court leads the Judicial Branch of the United States Federal Government It is the only US court established by the United States Constitution and its decisions are supposed to be followed by all other courts in the United States The Court meets in its own building in Washington DC However until 1935 the Supreme Court met in the United States Capitol 

The number of judges has changed over time Now there are 9 judges on the court one Chief Justice and eight Associate Justices 

The Supreme Court decides what lawsuits it will decide on Many people file lawsuits with the Supreme Court but most of them are refused

To be accepted lawsuits must be about federal law not state or local law Lawsuits must be decided by the federal District Court and the federal Court of Appeals Even after that the Supreme Court can decide not to consider lawsuits without giving a reason

The judges serve for life unless they want to retire earlier When a judge dies or retires the President of the United States picks or nominates the replacement Usually the President tries to pick someone that is not too old and whom he thinks shares the same political beliefs Sometimes the judges have surprised people when they turn out to be more liberal or conservative than expected

The current Justices are

Autumn is the season after summer and before winter In the United States this season is also called fall In the Northern Hemisphere it begins with the autumnal equinox and ends with the winter solstice In the Southern Hemisphere it runs from the autumnal equinox to the winter solstice

In many places autumn is a time for harvesting most crops Deciduous trees lose their leaves usually after turning yellow red or brown Evergreen trees keep their leaves all year round Also in many countries autumn is the time a new school year starts In the UK the period of school between the start of September and the end of December is known as the Autumn Term

When it is autumn in the Northern Hemisphere it is spring in the Southern Hemisphere When it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere On the Equator autumn is very much like spring with little difference in temperature or in weather Autumn is a time when most animals are looking for food so they can store up for winter because they soon will be going into hibernation The weather gets colder and more windy

John Locke known as the Father of Liberalism was an English philosopher and physician His writings influenced Voltaire and Rousseau a lot of Scottish Enlightenment thinkers as well as the American revolutionaries He is mentioned in the American Declaration of Independence

Lockes theories were usually about identity and the self Locke thought that we are born without thoughts and that knowledge is instead determined only by experience

Lockes father who was also named John Locke was a country lawyer He had served as a captain in the early part of the English Civil War His mother Agnes Keene was a tanners daughter and was thought to be very beautiful Both mother and father were Puritans Locke was born on 29 August 1632 in a cottage by the church in Wrington Somerset about twelve miles from Bristol He was baptized when he was born After that his family soon moved to Pensford

In 1647 Locke was sent to Westminster School in London During this time he was being sponsored by Alexander Popham a member of the Parliament After finishing his studies there he went into the Christ Church Although Locke was a good student he did not like the schedule of the time spent there He did not like the classical subjects taught at the university and wanted to learn more about modern philosophy Through his friend Richard Lower whom he had met at the school Locke learned about medicine 

Locke was awarded a bachelors degree in 1656 and a masters degree in 1658 In 1666 he met Lord Anthony Ashley Cooper who had come to Oxford seeking treatment for his liver disease Cooper was impressed with Locke and asked him to come

Locke had been looking for a job and in 1667 moved into Shaftesburys home at Exeter House in London to serve as Lord Ashleys personal physician In London Locke continued his studies on medicine

Lockes medical knowledge was put to the test when Shaftesburys liver disease became worse until Shaftesbury was about to die Locke used the advice of several physicians and persuaded Shaftesbury to go to an operation Shaftesbury lived through the operation and thanked Locke with saving his life

Shaftesbury as a member of the Whig movement was a big influence on Lockes political ideas However after Shaftesbury began to fall from favor in 1675 Locke decided to travel across France He came back to England in 1679 At this time due to Shaftesburys insists Locke wrote the Two Treatises of Government While it was once thought that Locke wrote the Treatises to defend the Glorious Revolution of 1688 recent scholarship has shown that the work was composed before this even started

However Locke ran away to the Netherlands in 1683 This is because people became suspicious of him being involved in the Rye House Plot In the Netherlands Locke had time to return to his writing spending a great deal of time re working the Essay Locke did not return home until after the Glorious Revolution Locke came with William of Oranges wife back to England in 1688

Lockes close friend Lady Masham invited him to join her at the Mashams country house in Essex Although his time there was marked by variable health from asthma attacks he nevertheless became an intellectual hero of the Whigs During this period he discussed matters with such figures as John Dryden and Isaac Newton

He died in 28 October 1704 and is buried in the churchyard of the village of High Laver east of Harlow in Essex where he had lived in the household of Sir Francis Masham since 1691 Locke never married nor had children 

Events that happened during Lockes lifetime include the English Restoration the Great Plague of London and the Great Fire of London He did not quite see the Act of Union of 1707 though the thrones of England and Scotland were held in personal union throughout his lifetime Constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy were in their infancy during Lockes time

A satellite is an object that orbits another object Usually this means in space Satellites may be made by man or they may be natural The moon is a natural satellite that orbits the Earth Most man made satellites also orbit the Earth but some orbit other planets such as Venus or Mars

Most of the man made satellites are in a low Earth orbit or a geostationary orbit A satellite in a geostationary orbit moves around the Earth as fast as the Earth spins so from the ground it looks like it is stationary To move this way the satellite must be above the equator about 35786 kilometers above the ground Satellites in low Earth orbit are less than one thousand kilometers above the ground They move much faster Many are in tilted orbits

Uses of man made satellites include machines that relay television signals take photographs send telephone traffic help with weather forecasting space investigation and pollution control The first man made satellite was Sputnik

Man made satellites have six main uses

Sigmund Freud was an Austrian neurologist He invented the treatment of mental illness and neurosis by means of psychoanalysis

Freud is important in psychology because he studied the unconscious The unconscious is a part of a persons mind which he is not aware of and which he cannot control easily 

After Freud wrote his first book he got married to Martha Bernays They had six children

Freud lived in Austria in the 1930s After the Anschluss Germany and Austria were combined Because he was Jewish he received a visit from the Gestapo Freud and his family did not feel safe anymore Freud left Vienna and went to England in June 1938 

Freud developed a theory of the human mind He also had a theory that human behaviour both conditions and results from how the mind is organised 

This led him to favor certain clinical techniques for trying to help cure mental illness He theorised that personality is developed by a persons childhood experiences

Freud began his study of medicine at the University of Vienna He got his MD degree in 1881 at the age of 25 and entered private practice in neurology for financial reasons 

Freud hoped that his research would provide a solid scientific basis for his therapeutic technique The goal of Freudian therapy or psychoanalysis was to bring repressed thoughts and feelings into consciousness in order to free the patient from suffering distorted emotions

Classically the bringing of unconscious thoughts and feelings to consciousness is brought about by encouraging a patient to talk in free association and to talk about dreams

The origin of Freuds early work with psychoanalysis can be linked to Josef Breuer In November 1880 Breuer was called in to treat a highly intelligent 21 year old woman for a persistent cough which he diagnosed as hysterical He found that while nursing her dying father she had developed a number of transitory symptoms including visual disorders and paralysis and contractures of limbs which he also diagnosed as hysterical 

Breuer began to see his patient almost every day as the symptoms increased and became more persistent He found that when with his encouragement she told fantasy stories her condition improved and most of her symptoms had disappeared by April 1881 However following the death of her father in that month her condition deteriorated again Breuer recorded that some of the symptoms eventually remitted spontaneously and that full recovery was achieved by inducing her to recall events that had precipitated the occurrence of a specific symptom This recovery is disputed

Freud famously proposed that unconscious memories of infantile sexual abuse were at the root of the psychoneuroses However patients were generally unconvinced that Freuds clinical procedure indicated actual sexual abuse He reported that even after a supposed reproduction of sexual scenes the patients assured him emphatically of their disbelief

As a medical researcher Freud was an early user and proponent of cocaine as a stimulant as well as analgesic He wrote several articles on the antidepressant qualities of the drug and he was influenced by friend and confidant Wilhelm Fliess who recommended cocaine for the treatment of nasal reflex neurosis 

Freud felt that cocaine would work as a cure for many conditions and wrote a well received paper On Coca explaining its virtues He prescribed it to his friend Ernst von Fleischl Marxow to help him overcome a morphine addiction acquired while treating a disease of the nervous system Freud also recommended cocaine to many of his close family and friends 

Reports of addiction and overdose began to come from many parts of the world Freuds medical reputation became somewhat tarnished because of this early ambition Furthermore Freuds friend Fleischl Marxow developed an acute case of cocaine psychosis as a result of Freuds prescriptions and died a few years later Freud felt great regret over these events

Freud made arguments about the importance of the unconscious mind in understanding conscious thought and behavior 

However the unconscious was not discovered by Freud Historian of psychology Mark Altschule concluded It is difficultor perhaps impossibleto find a nineteenth century psychologist or psychiatrist who did not recognize unconscious thought as not only real but of the highest importance Freuds advance was not to uncover the unconscious but to devise a method for systematically studying it

Freud called dreams the royal road to the unconscious This meant that dreams illustrate the logic of the unconscious mind Freud developed his first topology of the psyche in The Interpretation of Dreams in which he proposed that the unconscious exists and described a method for gaining access to it The preconscious was described as a layer between conscious and unconscious thought its contents could be accessed with a little effort

One key factor in the operation of the unconscious is repression Freud believed that many people repress painful memories deep into their unconscious mind

Freud hoped his model was universally valid and so turned to ancient mythology and ethnography for comparative material Freud named his new theory the Oedipus complex after the famous Greek tragedy Oedipus Rex by Sophocles I found in myself a constant love for my mother and jealousy of my father I now consider this to be a universal event in childhood Freud said Freud sought to anchor this pattern of development in the dynamics of the mind Each stage is a progression into adult sexual maturity characterized by a strong ego and the ability to delay gratification 

He used the Oedipus conflict to point out how much he believed that people desire incest and must repress that desire The Oedipus conflict was described as a state of psychosexual development and awareness 

Freud originally thought childhood sexual abuse was a general explanation for the origin of neuroses but he abandoned this so called seduction theory He noted finding many cases in which apparent memories of childhood sexual abuse were based more on imagination than on real events 

During the late 1890s Freud who never abandoned his belief in the sexual cause of neuroses began to emphasize fantasies built around the Oedipus complex as the primary cause of hysteria and other neurotic symptoms Despite this change in his explanatory model Freud always recognized that some neurotics had in fact been sexually abused by their fathers He explicitly discussed several patients whom he knew to have been abused

Freud also believed that the libido developed in individuals by changing its object a process called sublimation He argued that humans are born polymorphously perverse meaning that any number of objects could be a source of pleasure He further argued that as humans develop they become fixated on different and specific objects through their stages of development first in the oral stage then in the anal stage then in the phallic stage 

Freud argued that children then passed through a stage in which they fixated on the mother as a sexual object but that the child eventually overcame and repressed this desire because of its taboo nature The repressive or dormant latency stage of psychosexual development comes before the sexually mature genital stage of psychosexual development

In his later work Freud proposed that the human psyche could be divided into three parts Id ego and super ego Freud discussed this model in the 1920 essay Beyond the Pleasure Principle and fully elaborated upon it in The Ego and the Id The Id is the impulsive child like portion of the psyche that operates on the pleasure principle and only takes into account what it wants and disregards all consequences 

The term Ego entered the English language in the late 18th century Ego is Latin for I am and hence represents the thought and behaviour derived from two other sources

The term Id represents the primitive urges to possess conquer dominate and achieve pleasure It can be seen very clearly in young children who have not yet learnt to mask their feelings

The Super ego is the moral component of the psyche which makes a clear distinction between right and wrong and makes no allowance for special circumstances

The rational Ego attempts to get a balance between the impractical hedonism of the Id and the equally impractical moralism of the Super ego it is the part of the psyche that is usually reflected most directly in a persons actions 

When overburdened or threatened by its tasks the Ego may employ defense mechanisms including denial repression and displacement The theory of ego defense mechanisms has received empirical validation and the nature of repression in particular became one of the more fiercely debated areas of psychology in the 1990s

Freud believed that humans were driven by two conflicting central desires the life drive and the death drive 

Freud recognized the death drive only in his later years and developed his theory of it in Beyond the Pleasure Principle 

Freud acknowledged the tendency for the unconscious to repeat unpleasurable experiences in order to desensitize or deaden the body This compulsion to repeat unpleasurable experiences explains why traumatic nightmares occur in dreams as nightmares seem to contradict Freuds earlier conception of dreams purely as a site of pleasure fantasy and desire 

On the one hand the life drives promote survival by avoiding extreme unpleasure and any threat to life On the other hand the death drive functions simultaneously toward extreme pleasure which leads to death Freud addressed the conceptual dualities of pleasure and unpleasure as well as sexlife and death in his discussions on masochism and sadomasochism The tension between life drive and death drive represented a revolution in his manner of thinking

A snack is a kind of food It is usually small in size and can be any kind of food that you do not eat in large amount Because it is not meant to be a meal a snack is not breakfast lunch or dinner People eat snacks if they are hungry between meals For example eating potato chips after lunch but before dinner is eating a snack Snacks are easy to eat and portable in most cases Examples of snacks are Mars Snickers Bounty and Twix These are made of chocolate and with a different filling If you eat a snack it will give you energy which usually comes from the large amounts of sugar andor fat in the food so eating snacks is good for you most of the time We need the energy from the food because we lose energywalking enduring in sport and even concentrating

Encryption is a method which allows information to be hidden so that it cannot be read without special knowledge or tools Once this is done the information is encrypted Decryption is a way to change an encrypted piece of information back into unencrypted form This is called the decrypted form

A simple kind of encryption for words is ROT13 In ROT13 letters of the alphabet are changed with each other using a simple pattern For example A changes to N B changes to O C changes to P and so on Each letter is rotated by 13 spaces Using the ROT13 cipher the words Simple English Wikipedia becomes Fvzcyr Ratyvfu Jvxvcrqvn The ROT13 cipher is very easy to decrypt Because there are 26 letters in the English alphabet if a letter is rotated two times by 13 letters each time the original letter will be obtained So applying the ROT13 cipher a second time brings back the original text

Most kinds of encryption are more complex Some are made only for text Others are made for binary computer files like pictures and music Today the encryption system used the most is RSA Any computer file can be encrypted with RSA

Encryption is used on the Internet Web sites use encryption to protect private information On the Internet several encryption protocols are used such as Secure Sockets Layer IPsec and SSH They use the RSA encryption system and others The protocol for protected web browsing is called HTTPS Mostly URL encryption contain MD5 Algorithm Various alogorithm are available on the internetmarket depending upon the need

Pseudoscience is an idea that looks like science but is not Pseudoscience may fail one or more parts of science Sometimes pseudoscience are ideas that are thought to be wrong

Essentially pseudoscience is any idea about how nature works that is generally not accepted as true by the mainstream scientific community An idea can be considered pseudoscientific for any number of reasons The word pseudoscience literally means false science Creationism and Astrology are both well known pseudosciences

Pseudoscience is often considered immoral by scientists not because its claims are undemonstrated but because they are sometimes presented as facts andor real An average person might not recognize the differences in credibility between a television program about psychics supposedly reading peoples thoughts versus one that presents evidence for and against global warming

Ideas about how nature works may be considered pseudoscientific for many reasons Sometimes the hypothesis is just simply wrong and can be demonstrated to be wrong An example of this is the belief that the Earth is flat or the belief that human female skeletons have one more rib than mens do Ideas such as these are considered pseudoscientific because they are just simply wrong

Sometimes scientists agree that a certain idea may be true but could never be demonstrated to be true even in principle For example some people believe that the Earth and the universe came into existance last Thursday They believe that when the universe came into existence last Thursday it was created with the appearance of being many thousands or even millions of years old According to these believers even our memories of two weeks ago are actually just the false memories that came along with the creation of the universe which took place last Thursday Such a belief is considered pseudoscientific because it is not falsifiable  scientists cannot even imagine an experiment that could shed light on whether this belief is true or false

Other types of pseudoscience are considered pseudoscientific because they are based on deception even though the idea being used is not impossible Examples of this are people who claim to have build time travel devices antigravity devices or teleporters Scientists simply do not have the technology to build such things in modern times even though they may be able to someday

Some ideas are arguably pseudoscientific This means that some mainstream scientists consider the idea pseudoscientific and some do not Certain ideas about how the stock market behaves fall into this category

Pseudoscience is not exactly the same thing as biased research where the scientist has some bad motive for promoting their findings It is also not the same as an untested hypothesis which is an idea that scientists cannot test yet because they do not have the money or technology to do so The theories of quantum gravity are untested hypotheses scientists can easily imagine experiments to test them but they just do not quite have the technology to do so at this time

The pituitary gland is at the base of the brain between the eyes It is an important part of the endocrine system The gland is attached to the hypothalamus and gives out hormones It controls a whole range of vital functions

The pituitary gland consists of two parts the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary It is functionally linked to the hypothalamus by the pituitary stalk 

The hypothalamus releases factors down the pituitary stalk to the pituitary gland where they stimulate the release of pituitary hormones While the pituitary gland is known as the master endocrine gland both of the lobes are under the control of the hypothalamus

The gland releases several kinds of hormones

The anterior pituitary synthesizes and secretes the following important endocrine hormones 

The two Gonadotropins

and 

Oxytocin is one of the few hormones to create a positive feedback loop For example uterine contractions stimulate the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary which in turn increases uterine contractions This positive feedback loop continues throughout birth labour

An electron microscope is a scientific instrument which uses a beam of electrons to examine objects on a very fine scale In an optical microscope the wavelength of light limits the maximum magnification that is possible As electrons have a smaller wavelength they can achieve a higher magnification and can see very small objects  typically around 1000 times smaller than those seen in an optical microscope The outline of objects as revealed by the flow of electrons is changed into a picture using visible light for people to see

There are several major types of electron microscope such as Transmission Electron Microscope Reflection Electron Microscope Scanning Electron Microscope Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope and others Some of those are listed below

A beam of electrons is sent towards the specimen  some electrons are reflected while some pass through Those that pass through are detected and used to form an image of the specimen at a magnification of about 5000000 times

Similar to a Transmission Electron Microscope but the reflected electrons are detected By measuring the reflected electrons some information about the surface of the specimen can be gathered

A narrow beam of electrons is moved across the specimen and a picture is built up piece by piece by detecting how the electrons are reflected or absorbed as it moves

It combines the high magnification of TEM with the better surface detail of SEM It can be used to perform complex analysis on the specimen which cannot be done using TEM alone

The Airbus A320 is an airplane made by multi national company Airbus that first flew in 1987 At the most it can hold about 180 passengers Other versions have space for between 105 and 220 seats First broken wikt linkdeliverydelivered in 1988 the A320 was one of the first aircraft to use digital fly by wire flight control systems in a commercial aircraft With more than 3000 aircraft of the A320 family built it is the second best selling jet airliner family of all time after the Boeing 737

The A320 has been involved in several accidentssome of these have killed a lot of people The worst accident happened in 2007 when a TAM Airlines Airbus A320 crashed when it landed in So Paulo in Brazil during heavy rain The crash killed almost 200 people The A320 has also had a number of accidents involving the undercarriage

The A320 was the worlds first commercial jet to use a small joystick also called a sidestick to fly it instead of a normal yoke This matched the new digital fly by wire system the first use of this in a civilian aircraft which makes the A320 much easier and safer to fly

The A320 also has a full glass cockpit where most instruments in the cockpit have been replaced by television screens Most of the technology first used on the A320 has been used in other Airbus aircraft made afterwards Other manufacturers like Boeing have also used much of the technology like a glass cockpit and fly by wire in the Boeing 777

The A319 A320 and A321 have engines made by two different companies International Aero Engines supply the V2500 and CFM International provide the CFM56 Over 54 of A320s in the air today have CFM engines 

The significantly smaller A318 has either Pratt and Whitney PW6000 engines or CFM56 5 The PW6000 was not as good as expected and this may have reduced the number of sales several airlines cancelled their orders before the more efficient CFM engine arrived

Types 

The A320 has been shortened to produce the A319 and stretched to produce the A321 Recently it was shortened even more to make the A318 However this version has not sold as well and the only large operator is Frontier Airlines

These different versions are known as A320 derivatives When talking about all of them they are known as the A320 family or A32x

Changes in size are done by removing or adding sections of fuselage and adjusting the power of the engines Airbus try to keep the airplanes the same where possible to reduce operating costs 

Pilots only need one licence to fly all A320 derivatives

The A320 has been very reliable in service Many early problems were caused by pilots not being use to the new glass cockpit and fly by wire but these no longer happen In recent years the A320 has had a number of problems involving its front undercarriage The following accidents are some of those which have occurred since 1988

Seven incidents of nose gear malfunction including JetBlue Airways Flight 292

A priest or priestess is a person who is allowed to do religious rites Their office or position is the priesthood a word which can also be used for such persons collectively In most religions and cultures in history there have been priests although they have a lot of different names and follow different rules In Japan priestesses who guide the shrine are called mikos

The Red Sea also known the Gulf of Arabia is a sea between the Arabian peninsula of Asia in the northeast and Africa in the southwest It is a part of the Indian Ocean The Red Sea is about 2200 km long but its width is less than 330 km Many ships go through the Red Sea because the Suez Channel connects the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea and Bab el Mandeb at the opposite end is a gate to the Indian Ocean Ports of the Red Sea are for example Suez Port Sudan Massawa Yanbu al Bahr Jeddah Aqaba and Eilat 

It is named that because it sometimes looks red from the red algae The water of Red Sea has more salt and is clearer than water of most other seas because almost no rivers run into it The weather is dry and warm around the Red Sea and for this reason many people from Europe and other parts of the world come for their holiday to the Red Sea Some of them are divers who swim under the sea level to see rich coral reefs and fish Holiday places for example are Sharm el Sheikh Eilat or Hurghada The countries next to the Red Sea are Egypt Sudan Eritrea Yemen Saudi Arabia Jordan and Israel

According to the book of Exodus God parted it for Moses and the Israelites so they could escape from the Egyptian Army

During the colonial era many Native Americans were converted to Roman Catholicism and began using the Spanish language instead of their traditional one This was because of the concept that existed in the Spanish colonies which gave more value to European people over Native Americans and Africans Because of this many Native Americans gained better social status by calling themselves mestizos instead of Native American

The Eucharist also called holy communion the sacrament or the Lords supper is a kind of religious ritual in many Christian churches It started when Jesus Christ told his followers to eat bread and drink wine in memory of him at the Last Supper 

According to the Roman Catholic Church the Eucharist is the true presence of Jesus Christ the Son of God During a Mass through the act of transubstantiation the bread and wine offered change and are no longer bread and wine They truly become the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ The bread and wine do not change appearance but they truly are the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ which Catholics in good standing come and receive Christthey consume Him This follows what was said by Christ Eat my Body and Drink my Blood Most Protestant denominations believe that this was meant symbolically while the Catholic Church bases its beliefs off of the tradition handed down through the history of the church 

First century St Ignatius of Antioch disciple of the beloved disciple John in speaking of the heretics plaguing the church in their day wrote They abstain from the Eucharist because they do not confess that the Eucharist is the flesh of our Savior Jesus Christ

From the second century St Justin Martyr wrote This food we call Eucharist which no one is allowed to share except the one who believes that our teaching is true and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins and unto regeneration and so lives as Christ has handed down For we do not receive these as common bread and common drink but just as Jesus Christ our Savior having been made flesh by the word of God had both flesh and blood for our salvation so likewise we have learned that the food over which thanks has been given by the prayer of the word which comes from him and by which our blood and flesh are nourished through a change is the Flesh and Blood of the same incarnate Jesus

In most Protestant churches not including Lutheranism the sacrament of communion involves eating small wafers or Matzos and drinking wine or grape juice and not believing that it is the actual body and blood of Jesus but as a very important symbolic observance and fulfillment of what Christ commanded Some churches offer it daily some weekly some monthly and some a few times a year

Unlike the Catholic teaching Lutherans teach that the bread and wine is Jesus body and blood but is bread and wine also

In the Latter Day Saints or Mormon Church followers eat small pieces of bread and drink water They believe that this is a symbol of the body and blood of Jesus and they call it the Sacrament They also believe that it helps them to make the promises of baptism all over again

A patent is an official letter that anyone can read The letter is printed by a government The letter describes an invention The owner of the letter has the right to stop anyone from copying the invention The letter is first owned by the inventor The inventor can sell the letter to another person or a company 

The government reads the letter to make sure that the invention is new If the invention is not new then the inventor will not get the patent The invention also has to be hard to make If the invention is too easy to make the inventor will not get the patent

An inventor can sue someone to stop them from copying the invention The person or company that copies the invention will have to pay the inventor money They must also stop copying They are not sent to jail

The letter only lasts for 20 years After that anyone can copy the invention 

Each country has its own patents China gives Chinese patents India gives Indian patents The United States gives United States patents An inventor can get a patent in any country the inventor wants An inventor can get patents in many different countries for the same invention Each patent in each country costs money

The rules for patents are similar for most countries 

To get a patent the inventor must ask the government by describing the invention in writing This is called a patent application The inventor can write the patent application but it is usually written by a person trained to write patent applications This person is called a patent agent or if the person is a lawyer a patent attorney

The government does not usually just give the inventor a patent Instead the government tries to confirm whether the idea is actually new This is called patent examination The government will try to find books stories or even other patents that show that the idea was not new The inventor or his or her patent attorney then try to show how the inventors idea is different from anything that the government finds

If the government finds that the inventors idea is new and useful it will publish the patent The government will also send the inventor a copy of his or her patent application with a special seal This copy is the patent

The inventor must also pay the government a tax to get a patent Usually an inventor pays money to ask for the patent and the inventor pays money when he or she gets a patent In some countries the owner of a patent must also pay money to keep the patent

The owner of a patent can stop other people from using their idea If someone other than the patent owner uses the patent this is called infringing a patent If the owner knows that someone is infringing his or her patent the patent owner can ask a court to stop them If the court agrees that the other person was using the patent the court can make that person pay a fine to the patent owner

The patent owner can give other people permission to use their patent This is called a license The person that wants to use another persons patent will usually pay money to the patent owner

Patents most often cover products or processes that contain new functional or technical ideas They are concerned with how things work how they are made or what they are made of Patents cover many different things such as electronics medicines agriculture and transport anything in fact from a small detail in an electric switch to an entire power station

Often a product is marked with a text saying patent pending or pat pending which means that a patent has been asked for the product Then people are warned that they should not copy the invention 

Patents are usually very long They include a number of smaller parts A patent usually includes a section that briefly describes the idea called the abstract It also may include a section that describes other peoples inventions and how the inventors idea is different called the background of the invention

The patent also includes a long description of the idea itself called a detailed description In this section the inventor tries to describe every detail of his or her invention

The patent also has a number of pictures called the figures The figures are usually drawn by people called draftsman that are trained to draw in a special way The pictures are labeled with numbers to show different parts of the invention

At the end of most patents is a section called the claims These are usually numbered They include the a short statement that lists all of the things needed for the invention A court will use the claims to decide if another person is infringing the patent

Debt is what someone owes to someone else Usually debt is in the form of money but it can also be items favors or other things

Goods services or money borrowed with the intent of repayment creates a debt Debt can be secured or unsecured in nature

A secured debt involves the use of collateral which is an asset that is obligated to the debt holder until the debt has been repaid If the repayment is not made in full the collateral asset is forfeited For instance a car loan typically creates a secured debt If you still owe money on the car loan and do not make timely payments the note holder can confiscate the car and sell it to recoup the money still due

An unsecured debt is more risky to the debt holder because in the event of non payment of the debt the lender has no recourse to forfeited assets to help defray the loss incurred by not receiving the expected payment Credit card debt is typically unsecured If you charge items to a credit card and do not make the monthly payments due the credit card issuer can report the non payment to the credit reporting agencies which will negatively impact your credit score but they generally can not repossess whatever you bought with the card 

Uranium is a chemical element on the periodic table It has an atomic number of 92 which means that a uranium atom has 92 protons in its center which is called a nucleus A lump of uranium that is dug out of the ground will be made from three different isotopes that is three different types of uranium with different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei Most will probably be uranium 238 which has 238 protons and neutrons a small amount will probably be uranium 235 with 235 protons and neutrons and a very small amount will be uranium 234 with 234 protons and neutrons

Uranium 235 can be used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons by having a neutron inserted into its nucleus by humans This turns the uranium 235 into uranium 236 as the extra neutron is added to the 235 protons and neutrons already in the nucleus This almost always splits the nucleus into two smaller nuclei This makes two completely different elements with smaller atomic numbers This process is called nuclear fission and creates a huge amount of heat This heat makes it very useful for making electricity in nuclear reactors or for blowing things up with nuclear weapons

Uranium is weakly radioactive Uranium which has had all of its uranium 235 taken out of it is called depleted uranium Depleted Uranium is very heavy and thick This makes it good for balancing weight in airplanes and for making bombs which can destroy tanks easily Uranium can also be used as a dye for glass or pottery which is how it was used before people found out that it was radioactive and could be used for nuclear things

Uranium is a dangerous substance Because Uranium is radioactive it is often seen with the hazard sign for radioactive elements a group of three triangles with curved outer edges pointing in towards the middle as seen on the bottle on the right A lot of people believe that Uranium is a light green glowing colour However this is completely untrue because Uranium is black

In 1960 Upper Volta became independent from France The first president of the new country was Maurice Yamogo After he became the president Yamogo banned other political parties For several years the people of Upper Volta were very unhappy with the government and in 1966 the military took over in a military coup In 1983 the government was taken over again by military men called Thomas Sankara and Blaise Compaor Sankara became president In 1984 he changed the name of the country to Bukina Faso It means land of honest people

The Battle of Waterloo was a battle that was fought mostly between French and British forces Napoleon was crowned as Emperor of France in 1804 Then he launched many of successful attacks on the other countries of Europe France soon had an empire that stretched from Spain to the Russian border The only country that was still not captured was Great Britain The Royal Navy had many ships so invasion was not possible However Great Britain was not strong enough to stop Napoleon and his army from taking over most of mainland Europe

Napoleon seemed unstoppable until two separate campaigns caused his empire to fall apart He gathered a huge army to invade and conquer Russia once and for all in 1812 However he did not think that he would have vey many difficulties and it turned out he did His army was caught by the Russian winter and destroyed by the weather and lack of food

Now that Napoleon was much weaker the countries of Eastern Europe led by Austria and Prussia began to ally against him forcing his troops back towards France Meanwhile a small British army in Portugal and Spain led by Arthur Wellesley began to win victories over the French armies and to push Napoleons troops out of Spain

By 1814 he faced total defeat with the Austrians and Prussians invading from the east and the Duke of Wellington and the British army in the west A peace treaty was arranged Napoleon would abdicate and be exiled to a small Mediterranean island called Elba with a small army He was replaced as ruler of France by Louis XVIII brother of Louis XVI

Once he was on the island of Elba Napoleon was not happy He had been promised money by the new French government but the money did not come His wife and his sons were forbidden to visit him

Messages from France showed that the new French King was unpopular because he was trying to ignore many events that had taken place during the revolution The allies that had united against Napoleon were arguing in Vienna over the lands that they had recaptured He seized his opportunity going by ship in February 1815 and landing in France again His welcome was very mixed Many French were tired of war and the death and suffering that it led to However there were others who wanted a return to the power and glory of the old days and saw Napoleon as their best hope

His first days were tense but by personal leadership and persuasion Napoleon managed to gain the support of the army When the king panicked and fled the country there was little to stop Napoleon returning to Paris and resuming his title of Emperor

What Napoleon needed now was a period of time to organize himself and the French army The allies were caught completely by surprise and their only chance to stop him lay with two small armies in Belgium a British and Dutch army commanded by the Duke of Wellington and a Prussian army commanded by Prince Blucher

Napoleon decided on a further gamble He gathered an army and prepared a surprise attack on Wellington and Blucher hoping to catch them unprepared His plan was successful at first and he crossed the Belgian border before Wellington and Blucher could join forces

His first battle was at Ligny and after a fierce days fighting he defeated the Prussian army forcing it to retreat Thinking that Blucher would retreat back to Prussia Napoleon turned his attention towards Wellington There had already been a small battle at Quatre Bras as Wellington tried to delay the French advance This had given Wellington enough time to prepare a full defensive position across the road leading to Brussels near the village of Waterloo

The French army advanced towards them and set up their camp on a ridge facing the combined British and Dutch army Heavy rain caused delays and confusion and both armies settled down for the night in the mud to await the dawn and the forthcoming battle

Napoleons army faced the Duke of Wellingtons Anglo Dutch army near Waterloo on 18th June 1815 Wellingtons troops were deployed behind a low ridge partially protecting them from the French massed artillery

At 1100 Napoleon ordered his guns to open fire French infantry began an attack against the Chteau of Hougoumont defended by the British Foot Guards This was intended to draw Wellingtons reserves away from the centre where Napoleons main attack would fall And according to records this battle was considered to be a vital key to who will win the Battle Of Waterloo

At 1330 Napoleon launched an infantry attack against Wellingtons centre Men of the Kings German Legion resolutely defended the farm of La Haye Sainte serving to disrupt the French attack British artillery and musketry succeeded in repulsing the French assault and the British Household and Union heavy cavalry brigades charged after the retreating Frenchmen Elated by their success the British cavalry pursued their enemy too far and in turn suffered terrible casualties at the hands of the French lancers

At 1500 Marshal Ney believing the Anglo Dutch army to be retreating after the heavy bombardment they had received all day led a massed French cavalry attack against Wellingtons centre However the British infantry forming squares to defend themselves from cavalry attack held firm The French took terrible casualties as they circled these impregnable formations of infantrymen The situation further deteriorated for Napoleon as Bluchers Prussian troops launched an attack at Plancenoit to his rear at 1630

By early evening the French attack at Hougoumont intended as a diversion was now having the opposite effect The French committed more and more troops to the bitter fighting around the chteau which was held by only a small force of British Guardsmen More French reserves were being sent to meet the Prussian threat to the rear of Napoleons army at Plancenoit However the French had at last succeeded in capturing the farm of La Haye Sainte only a short distance from Wellingtons centre

At approximately 1930 Napoleon committed his last reserves in a final effort to obtain victory As Prussians arrived to bolster Wellingtons flank veterans of the French Imperial Guard advanced The British infantry exhausted from the continuous cannonade they had received all day rose to meet them The musketry of the British Guards Brigade defeated Napoleons finest troops They fled and the whole French army joined them in retreat Wellington ordered his entire line to advance and the French were chased from the field

The Democratic Republic of So Tom and Prncipe is the second smallest African country formed by two islands So Tom and Prncipe 

They are located about 140 km apart and about 250 and 225 km respectively off of the northwestern coast of Gabon 

The islands were a Portuguese colony but have been independent since July1975 Portuguese is the official language

The Porguese arrived in So Tom Island on December 21 1471 and Prncipe Island on January 17 1492 As these were days dedicated to saints both islands had saints names but S Anto Island the former name of Prncipe Island changed in 1500 in honour of a Portuguese prince 

The official historical version says that the country was uninhabited before the arrival of the Portuguese sailors 

The first successful Portuguese settlement in the archipelago was established in 1493 when the volcanic soil of the islands proved to be good for sugar plantation  the first economic cycle But between the 17th and the 18th centuries the islands suffered an economic and social decline as a consequence of a slaves revolt headed by King Amador

In the 19th century the archipelago regained importance to Portuguese settlers when they decided to introduce coffee and cacao plantations

On February 3 1953 the Massacre of Batep occurred when thousands of local people were killed by Portuguese settlers as a consequence of a disagreement between them about hired labour Since slavery had been abolished the Portuguese needed workers for their cacao and coffee plantations and the local people refused to work under the conditions offered which for them were similar to slavery

The archipelagos independence movement started with the constitution of the CLSTP formed in the late 1950s which changed its name to MLSTP the first political party after the independence on July 12 1975 

When So Tom and Prncipe was declared independent and became the Democratic Republic of So Tom and Prncipe Manuel Pinto da Costa the MLSTPs General Secretary was named the first archipelago president From then on the political system implemented was the single party regime which prevailed until the 1990s when there was a political and economic reform and the multiparty regime was implemented In the first presidential election Miguel Trovoada was elected as the second president of the islands His successor after two terms was Fradique de Menezes the current president who is in his second presidential term

The president like the prime minister is elected by direct universal suffrage for a five year term and can be re elected The PM is elected for a four year term and the thirteen members of the cabinet are chosen by him

The cabinet constitutes the executive power and shares the legislative power with the National Assembly The judiciary is independent from the other two

As a multiparty regime the countrys main political parties are the Movement for the Liberation of So Tom and Prncipe the Party of Democratic Convergence the Independent Democratic Action and the Democratic Movement Force for Change  Liberal Party 

So Tom and Prncipe is formed by two volcanic islands  the biggest of which is S Tom  and several islets and is located in the Gulf of Guinea off the Western equatorial coast of Africa Both islands belong to the Cameroon volcanic mountain line 

The archipelago is 1001km2 in size The equator line passes through the Rolass Islet which is located in the South of S Tom Island The biggest peak is located in S Tom known as Peak of S Tom with 2024m

The climate is tropical hot and humid with an annual average temperature of 27 C There are two main seasons Gravana the driest season when there is less or no rainfall and the temperatures are lower and the rainy season when the temperature is higher The former goes from June to August and the latter from October to May

Since the archipelago s discovery its economy has been based on agriculture and fishing Nowadays its main crop is cacao it represents 95 of the countrys exports and is followed by copper palm oil and coffee Another economic activity is tourism which the government and the private sector have been trying to promote and develop in the last few years

After independence the countrys economy was nationalized until the early 1990s when the government started an economic reform that consisted in privatization of the economic sectors

Nowadays the government budget is mainly based on foreign assistance from donors such as the UN Development Programme the World Bank and country donors

The main importers of the archipelagos production are Portugal with 51 France with 14 Angola with 11 and Japan with 10

In 2001 petroleum was found in the waters claimed by the archipelago and Nigeria After negotiations the two countries reached an agreement and in 2003 a joint development zone was opened for bids But so far there is no petroleum exploitation yet

According to the last census the total population of the archipelago was about 163000 inhabitants of which 52000 live in the capital and less than seven thousand live in Prncipe Island 

So Tom is the countrys capital and main city

The inhabitants of S Tom and Prncipe are divided into the following ethnic groups mixed blood descendents of Portuguese settlers and African slaves Forros the biggest ethnic group and descendents of freed slaves Angolares descendents of Angolan slaves Tonga mixed blood of Forros and hired workers from Angola Mozambique and Cape Verde and Cape Verdean descendents

In the last few years there has been a rural exodus of the population seeking better life conditions in the city S Tom

The countrys official language is Portuguese Other languages spoken are Forro a creole spoken by 80 of S Tom Islands inhabitants Angolar spoken mainly on the Southeast of S Tom Island Lungi spoken in Prncipe Island and Creole from Cape Verde

Almost everyone is Christian Roman Catholic Evangelical Protestant and Seventh Days Adventist But the Christian faith co exists among the population with Animist practices

The countrys culture is the product of Portuguese and African cultural influence Typical dances on the islands are ssua Socop Dxa and Puita Tchiloli Dano Congo and Auto dos Floripes are public theatrical performances examples of the Portuguese cultural legacy 

Important names of the archipelago history and culture are King Amador and Alda Esprito Santos 

The illiteracy rate in So Tom and Prncipe is above 70 although children start school at age six 

Nowadays the country has three private universities

Equatorial Guinea is the only country in Africa where Spanish is an official language

In 1982 a new constitution was made MBasogo was given the newly created post of president He was re elected in 1989 1996 and 2002 In 1989 he was the only candidate in the 1996 and 2002 international observers said the election results were false 

Obiangs regime kept clear authoritarian characteristics even after other parties were legalized in 1991 Most domestic and international observers consider his regime to be one of the most corrupt ethnocentric oppressive and undemocratic states in the world Equatorial Guinea is now essentially a single party state dominated by Obiangs Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea In 2008 American journalist Peter Maass called Obiang Africas worst dictator worse than Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe The constitution grants Obiang wide powers including the power to rule by decree Nonetheless Obiang has far less power than Macas For the most part his rule has been considerably milder Notably there have been none of the atrocities that characterized the Macas era

All but one member of the 100 seat national parliament belong to the PDGE or are aligned with it The opposition is severely hampered by the lack of a free press to express their views Around 90 of all opposition politicians live in exile 550 anti Obiang activists have been jailed unfairly and several killed since 1979

In July 2003 state operated radio declared Obiang to be a god who is in permanent contact with the Almighty and can decide to kill without anyone calling him to account and without going to hell He personally made similar comments in 1993 Despite these comments he still claims that he is a devout Catholic and was invited to the Vatican by John Paul II and again by Benedict XVI Macas had also proclaimed himself a god

Geology is the study of the nonliving things that the Earth is made of Geology is the study of rocks in the Earths crust People that study geology are called geologists Some geologists study minerals and the useful substances the rocks contain Geologists also study the history of the Earth 

Some of the important events in the Earths history are floods volcanic eruptions earthquakes orogeny and plate tectonics 

Geology is divided into special subjects that study one part of geology Some of these subjects are 

Rocks can be found in all sorts of shapes and colours Some are very hard and some are soft Some rocks are very common while others are rare However all the different rocks belong to three categories or types igneous sedimentary and metamorphic 

Igneous rock is rock that has been made by volcanic action Igneous rock is made when the lava or magma cools down and becomes hard Igneous rock formed from magma that has become solid inside the earth is called intrusive igneous rock Igneous rock formed from lava that has become solid on the outside of the Earth is called extrusive igneous rock This can happen because of the eruption of a volcano Some extrusive igneous rock types are basalt andesite rhyolite tuff obsidian and pumice Examples of intrusive igneous rock types are gabbro diorite and granite

Sedimentary rock is rock that has been made from sediment Sediment is all solid pieces of stuff that are moved by the wind water or glaciers Sediment can be made from clay sand gravel and the bodies and shells of animals The sediment gets dropped in a layer at the bottom of a river or sea As the sediment piles up the lowers layers get squashed together Slowly they set hard into rock Some sedimentary rocks are made of just one type of sediment all about the same size such as sand Other sedimentary rocks will have large and small lumps and pieces made of different types of rock Well known sedimentary rocks are sandstone and limestone

Metamorphic rock is rock that has been changed The word metamorphosis means change Sometimes an igneous or a sedimentary rock can be heated or squashed under the ground so that it changes Metamorphic rock is often harder than the rock that it was before it changed One well known metamorphic rock is marble which is valued for its different colours and because it can be carved and polished Slate is a metamorphic rock that is a useful building material

All three kinds of rock can be changed by being heated and squeezed by forces in the earth When this happens faults may appear in the rock Geologists can learn a lot about the history of the rock by studying the patterns of the fault lines Earthquakes are caused when a fault breaks suddenly

Soil is the stuff on the ground made of lots of particles The particles of soil come from rocks that have broken down and from rotting leaves and animals bodies Soil covers a lot of the surface of the Earth Plants of all sorts grow in soil

To find out more about types of rocks go to Rock To find out more about soil go to Soil

Geologists use some simple ideas which help them to understand the rocks and soil that they are studying These ideas are called the Principles of Geology

Electronic mail is an Internet service that allows those people who have an e mail address to send and receive electronic letters Those are much like postal letters except that they are delivered much faster than snail mail when sending over long distances and are usually free 

Like with regular mail users may get a lot of unwanted mail With e mail this is called spam Some programs used for sending and receiving mail can detect spam and filter it out nearly completely

To send or receive an email in the traditional way you need a device connected to the Internet and an e mail program Several formats exist for email addresses The most common called RFC 2822 looks like userdomaincom E mail messages are sent mostly by text and sometimes by HTML style

Some companies let you send and receive emails for free from a remote website Gmail Hotmail and Yahoo do this kind of service which is known as web mail Note web mail does not follow the pattern below exactly because the webpage takes care of a lot of the details by itself Rather the below pattern is what takes place when using the traditional method

Also Microsoft invented its own protocol for sending and receiving mail The name of the protocol is Exchange Exchange protocol works entirely different from the traditional method and is not explained here

This diagram gives an example of what happens when email is sent from one person to another using the traditional method In this example Alice is sending email to Bob

Bad Religion is an American punk band made in Southern California in 1979 by Jay Bentley Greg Graffin Brett Gurewitz and Jay Ziskrout People think that they brought back punk rock and helped pop punk bands during the late 1980s Since they were created 30 years ago Bad Religion has had a lot of members come and go Greg Graffin is the only person thats been in the band the whole time but today there are three of the four members that were in the group when it started

Today Bad Religion has fourteen studio albums two EPs three compilation albums one live recording and two DVDs Some critics think that their 1988 album Suffer is one of the most important punk rock albums of all time People began to notice Bad Religion after their 1993 album Recipe for Hate which was number 14 on Billboards Heatseekers chart Their next album Stranger Than Fiction had the bands well known hits 21st Century and Infected did well and was the only Bad Religion album to get gold status in the US Brett Gurewitz left in 1994 Bad Religion was not as well known after that and did not sell many albums until The Process of Belief in 2002 Brett Gurewitz came back in 2001 and worked with them on their four most recent albums The band is planning to make another album in 2012

Most of Bad Religions lyrics are written by Greg Graffin or Brett Gurewitz Sometimes but often they will co write a song Other band members such as Jay Bentley also write songs but very rarely

Brett Gurewitz says he tried to copy The Germs singer Darby Crash early on in Bad Religions career He wrote some intelligent stuff and didnt shy away from the vocabulary which I thought was cool Bad Religion also uses voice harmonies The Adolescents influenced them with their three part voice harmonies Bassist Jay Bentley says Seeing The Adolescents live it was so brilliant So in a way the Adolescents influenced us into saying we can do it too because look theyre doing it 

Many of Bad Religions songs are about what they think are social problems but they do not blame causes of these problems to any single person or group Greg Graffin thinks that the politics in the United States can make it hard to talk about the problems

The band is sometimes direct about the things they want to say Brett Gurewitz said he was angry at former US president George W Bush and that The Empire Strikes First is about him Our whole album is dedicated to getting Bush out of office Im not a presidential scholar but I dont think youll find a worse president in the history of the United States Hes probably one of the worst leaders in the history of world leaders I just hate the guy

Despite the name of the band the members say they are not anti religious Greg Graffin says that more often than not the band likes to use religion to represent anything that does not let a person be free Their songs are more about being against everyone being the same than against religion or God But Greg Graffin is an atheist He helped write the book Is Belief in God Good Bad or Irrelevant The bands bassist Jay Bentley has stated that he has spiritual beliefs Brett Gurewitz is a provisional deist

In the autumn Bundy moved to Utah to begin studying law at a college there He began killing again in October Bundy kidnapped and killed three girls in October of 1974 one of them was the daughter of a police officer On November 8 Bundy told a girl that he was a police officer and he told her to get in his car She did believing he really was a police officer He then tried to handcuff her but she would not let him and she jumped out of the car and escaped Bundy was angry that she had got away and so a few hours later he kidnapped another girl and killed her Her body was never found Bundy was still living in Utah in 1975 and was still attending law school but he began only killing people in Colorado Bundy kidnapped and killed four women from Colorado and one more from Utah in the first half of 1975

On August 16 1975 Bundy was arrested for not stopping his car when ordered to by a police officer When they searched his car they found a ski mask a crowbar handcuffs trash bags and other items that they thought he must have been using to rob houses The police then noticed that his car was the car the girl who escaped had told them about Bundy was sentenced on March 1 1976 to fifteen years in prison for kidnapping her Bundy escaped from the police twice in 1977 before he could be sentenced for the murders he had committed By early 1978 he had made his way to Florida where he killed two more women and injured three others After that he murdered a 12 year old girl called Kimberley Leach She was the last girl murdered by Bundy as he was stopped by a police officer on February 15 1978

Bundy went on trial on June 25 to July 31 for the murders he had committed He was sentenced to death by the electric chair In the time he was in prison and waiting to be executed he helped the police investigate other murders and in 1988 he admitted to having killed 8 more women than he was tried for Bundy was executed on January 24 1989 He was 42 years old

Longboarding is a form of skateboarding Instead of using a normal sized board the longboarder uses a board that is about two times as long sometimes longer Longboard lengths typically range from 35 to 54 Instead of skating on ramps and half pipes the longboarder can skate down long and steep hills turning back and forth across the hills face to slow down as a skier would The longboard is also much more efficient for cruising or simply getting around as longboards typically are faster more stable and less tiring to propel than short boards Unlike a bicycle a longboard is less vulnerable to theft as ones board may be carried under ones arm or stashed in a coat closet at work

Advanced longboarders may be seen powersliding to slow their boards on really steep hills Special gloves incorporating a hockey puck like friction pad velcroed to the palm may be worn which assists in both balance and braking allowing one hand to be dragged on the ground A lot of longbarders just make their own gloves from sections of sliced up cutting board epoxied to the palm and fingers of work gloves On narrow terribly steep hills theres not enough room to carve back and forth to keep ones speed down and bombing similarly could result in an accident or uncontrollably high speed and so power sliding was invented by a California surfer Power sliding is a seriously difficult and gymnastic method of slowing a board though While learning the power slide full pads and a helmet are a must During more ordinary city commuting the easiest braking skill one learns is simply to drag the toe or heel of ones rear foot on the ground The trucks of a longboard turn far more freely than that of a freestyle board

grafti are marks or writing made on a door They are often made with paint or spray paint A single mark could be called a graffito but the word graffiti is usually used meaning that there is more than 1 mark

Graffiti can take the form of art drawings or words When done without a property owners permission it is considered vandalism Sometimes it is just a persons name or a rude word Sometimes it is as a public political protest

Graffiti has been found in very old cities For example in the Roman Empire people wrote messages and drew caricatures on wallscn Graffiti is also found in many places Some of people do murals of graffiti rather than just writing one mark in a location It was used for good instead of vandalism Probably the simplest graffiti is when a person cuts the name of a lover on a tree with a knife

Today many graffiti are very complicated mixtures of writing and pictures They are sometimes made by gangs and applied with spray paint to buildings bridges street signs and other areas These are often signed with a tag which is a shape special to an artist or group

Graffiti can be thought of as a part of hip hop or street protest It is often but not always illegal Some cities have small areas where graffiti can be made Sometimes graffiti are very beautiful Some people consider graffiti as not only something bad but something good like art Some people pay graffiti artists to do graffiti on their buildings In the 1980s some graffiti artists like Keith Haring became very famous 

Modern graffiti was made famous in New York City in the early 1970s by the children of the working class They called it writing and called themselves writers In a 1971 New York Times article the term graffiti was first used to refer to the new urban art explosion that was becoming popular in New York City This period of the early 1970s is known as the Original School Later in the 1980s the next generation of graffiti artists is known as Old School 

Appellation dOrigine Controle is a French phrase which shows that a product comes from a certain area 

Some products must come from a certain area and be made in a certain way in order to have the name of the product The most famous example is champagne which must be fermented in the bottle and be made in the Champagne region 

The French government set up the Institut National des Appellations dOrigine in 1935 to oversee the system Although usually linked with wines the start of the system of protecting the name of goods started in the 15th century when the French parliament defined what could be called Roquefort cheese  

AOCs are most often found in connection with

Distillation is a chemical engineering unit operation where two or more liquids are separated from each other The liquids are heated until they boil The liquids will have different vapor pressures meaning they boil at different temperatures and one of them will evaporate before the other does The vapor is then led into a condenser which takes off its heat and condenses it back to its original form turning it a sludgy green colour in the process A fractionating column can be used to improve the separation Distillation is a mass transfer unit operation and can be used for making dirty water cleaner 

The vaporized and condensed component is called distillate and the other component as the rejected left overs

This has been used for a long time to distill alcohol pond water and certain brands of coffee and produce distilled beverages Distillation is a commonly used operation in oil industry where it is used to produce various fuels and raw materials from crude oil and plankton

Illegally distilled alcoholic drinks are called moonshineor moldy cheeseFactdateJuly 2009

Distillation can be done anywhere whether its in a house or a laboratory

A lawyer is someone who studied law and got a degree in that discipline If people have a problem with law or with someone else they might go to a lawyer to get legal advice If the case goes to court the lawyer will then represent those people either defending the person because someone else has started a legal case or arguing a case that the person has started Lawyers also help people settle out of court which generally means to agree to a punishment in a criminal law case or a payment of money in a civil law case When a person is accused of a crime the person has a defense lawyer to try to show they have not committed a crime The lawyer arguing that they did do the crime is called the prosecutor

He or she might also help to prepare legal documents for those people or give legally binding witness that some event took place

Lawyers work in different settings Some work by themselves while some work in big law firms Some lawyers work for hospitals and private companies Lawyers who work for private companies are usually called in house counsel

There are fees for the different services offered unless the work is done for free which is called pro bono

Loreto is Perus most northern region Covering almost one third of Perus territory Loreto is the nations biggest region It is also one of the least populated ones because of its remote location in the Amazon rainforest Its capital is the city of Iquitos 

Iquitos is the capital city of the Loreto Region in northern Peru It is on the banks of the Amazon River Iquitos is the biggest city in the rain forest of Peru with about 400000 residents It is a major port on the Amazon 

Excluding towns on islands Iquitos is thought to be the largest city in the world that can not be reached by road One can only get to Iquitos by boat or by airplane It is very remote in the middle of the Amazon rainforest 

Iquitos was founded in 1747 by Jesuit Jos Bahamonde Originally it was the home of the Iquito native tribe About 100 years ago Iquitos was a very rich town because of the rubber industry Today Iquitos relies mostly on tourism wood industry and local trade 

Apple juice is the juice from apples It does not have alcohol and it tastes sweet from the natural fruit sugars Many companies making apple juice like to say that they do not add more sugar into the drink and there is only natural sugar

The apple tree came from the Crab tree or Wild Apple and is native to Britain Even in the Old Saxon papers apples and cider are mentioned a lot The fruit is thought to have come in the Caucasus a place with many mountains between the Black and Caspian Seas

The Lady apple a kind of apple still grown today is believed to be one of the oldest apple trees on record

In both facts and stories the apple appears to be very healthy There are two types of apple juice One is the clear apple juice and the other is the cloudy apple juice Pectin and starch are taken out during the production process to produce clear apple juice Cloudy apple juice is cloudy because of evenly distributed small pulp suspensions in the juice concentrate Also in apple juice the vitamin C and other vitamins are contained inside as well as mineral nutrients such as boron which helps build strong bones Research from the University of Massachusetts Lowell shows that apple juice also increases acetylcholine in the brain which gets you increased memory

Apples can also be a main source of fiber and is a powerful cleanser and an important necessity for the health of your body

The compounds in apple juice called phytonutrients delay the break down of LDL or cholesterol In history the phrase from Benjamin Franklin an apple a day keeps the doctor away is very famous New research is proving this phrase to be a fact Researchers at UC Davis School of Medicine have recently found out that drinking apple juice seems to slow down the process that may lead to heart disease

Researchers at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands had studied and found that smokers who ate many fruits and vegetables especially apples had reduced their risk of getting the common diseases smokers would get The risk was reduced by 50

For older people drinking fruit juices should begin with apples especially if they are suffering from arthritis and rheumatism This is because apples carry a substantial amount of potassium Because of this eating apples or apple juice has been known to help Drinking apple juice also removes some toxins from the liver and kidneys and is low in calories Over time this can reduce the chances of having liver or kidney disease

Apple juice can be used to make cider and calvados Some types of cider and all types of Calvados contain alcohol

Addressed as one of the most popular fruits in the world the apple is cultivated in around 7500 different kinds in shape color texture firmness crispness acidity juiciness sweetness nutrition and harvesting time 

Calvados can be

Calvados is an alcoholic drink It is made from distilling cider in the French department of Calvados in Normandy and also in Normandy itself It got its name from the department which is famous for making it

Calvados is made of cider with a degree of alcohol of 12 to 15 through a process called double distillation In the first pass the result is a liquid containing 28 to 30 alcohol In a second pass the amount of alcohol is augmented to about 40

Since 1942 the Calvados has its own Appellation dOrigine Contrle as follows

The Calvados can be served either dry or with ice as a cocktail an aperitif or as a digestif It goes very well with cheese chocolates desserts or ice cream You can also take your crepes with calvados

A still is a tool used to clean a liquid It does this by first boiling the liquid and turning it into a gas This gas is then cooled changing it back into liquid Stills get their name from the word distillation Distillation is the process of boiling and cooling a liquid to purify it Stills are most often used to create alcohol but they can also be used with any liquid Some examples are medicines and perfumes

There are two main types of stills pot stills and reflux stills In a pot still the pot holding the liquid is heated The hot gas is cooled in a simple neck or tube and collected Pot stills are used for making alcohol like whisky A reflux still is much more complex It works with a continual flow of liquid going into the boiler and a continual flow of distilled liquid coming out The distilled liquid can also be put through the process several times which is why it is called a reflux still This allows for a more pure product and the person working the still can control the level of purity Reflux stills are used in the chemical and petroleum industries

Ravioli is a type of Italian pasta dish It is usually two layers of pasta dough with a filling between the two layers There are many different recipes with different kinds of fillings The most common fillings are meat vegetables or ricotta cheese People eat this kind of food with a sauce or melted butter

The Bridge on the River Kwai is a 1957 movie from Columbia Pictures based on Pierre Boulles 1952 book The Bridge over the River Kwai The movie was mainly filmed in Ceylon and also in England

In 1941 the Japanese Army invaded Thailand They built a railway to link Bangkok to Rangoon Thousands of Asian workers and POWs died while working on the project Part of this project was building bridges over Thailands Kwai Yai at a place named Tamarkan which is near a town named Kanchanaburi 

The deaths of the Asian workers and the prisoners were real events but most of the book and the movie are not true The British soldiers were slaves they did not help the Japanese Two bridges were built one was made of wood one was made of concrete and steel Both bridges stood for two years and were destroyed by bombers in 1945

In the movie the bridge is destroyed by commandos A real train rode over the bridge as it blew up

The movie is best known for the Colonel Bogey March the song that is whistled by the POWs It is also known as the River Kwai March

The movie won seven Academy Awards one for Best Picture

Tannins are bitter tasting chemical compounds that bind proteins Tannins are present in the following

Tannins are also used in the treatment of leather to make it more durable

Cuisine is a French word and literally means kitchen When people talk about cuisine or haute cuisine they do not mean kitchens but rather a number of special recipes for which a particular nation is famous When they talk about French cuisine they mean all recipes the French are famous for

A hotel or a guest house is a large building with many rooms where people can sleep when they are not at home A motel is a hotel especially for motorists  people who drive cars  where the room door usually opens into the parking lot Inn is sometimes used to mean a smaller hotel 

These places will rent a room for any number of days They offer rooms to sleep and want money for the service There are also hotels where conferences are held

  

Some Like It Hot is a 1959 comedy movie starring Marilyn Monroe and Jack Lemmon and directed by Billy Wilder It is seen by some as a remake of a German movie from 1951 called Fanfaren der Liebe

Some Like It Hot has been remade for the stage twice

The movie was ranked at Number One on the AFIs 100 Years 100 Laughs list and fourteen on the AFIs 100 Years 100 Movies list

Salzburg is the capital of the Austrian state of Salzburg or Salzburgerland The population is about 150000 and is the 4th largest city of Austria

Its most famous citizen was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Another famous inhabitant of Salzburg was the physicist Christian Doppler who found the Doppler effect which was named after him 

The Salzach river crosses the cityThe old town was adopted by the UNESCO as World Heritage in 1996 Known is Salzburg also for being one of the settings for the film The Sound of Music which based on the musical by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein

People lived in Salzburg since the New Stone Age till present The oldest finding in the city area is dated around 4500 BC From 15 BC onwards after the Roman occupation the city was called Iuvavum The roman city was situated in todays old town around the Waagplatz The city became an important place from the east to the province of Germania The Romans left on the beginning of the barbarian migration around 500 Up to 696 only few can be said about the history 696 the city was given to bishop Rupert by Duke Theodo II of Bavaria Rupert was orderd by the Duke to bring Christianity to the east and southeast of his country Rupert founded the monestary St Peter and for women the monestary Nonnberg 739 Salzburg became the seat of a bishop and 774 the first cathedral was built 998 Salzburg became archbishopric ruling the whole Bavarian area

In the middle ages Salzburg became wealthy by the trade with salt from the nearby Drnberg in Hallein Till th 14th century Salzburg became independent from Bavaria and was a state within the Holy Roman Empire The citizens of Salzburg were under the command of the archbishop unlike other cities in the empire In the baroque era the look of todays city was shaped The cathedral was rebuilt in the baroque style Most of the architects came from Italy 1622 a university was founded Due to the fact that it was a catholic state protestants had a severe standing in Salzburg Yet 1731 protestants who came not back to the catholic belief had do leave Salzburg within eight days 

In the early 19th century Napoleon Bonaparte promoted the Duchy of Salzburg than later was a part of the Kingdom of Bavaria Then Salzburg was annexed by Austria returned to Bavarian and divided between Bavaria and Austria 1918 Salzburg became a federal state of the new Republic of Austria In 1938 Germany annexed Austria and Salzburg was a part of Germany In 1945 when Austria was independent from Germany Salzburg became a federal state again

Basque is the language spoken by the Basque people in the Basque Country and diaspora The Standard Basque name for the language is euskara Although it is surrounded by Indo European languages Basque is perhaps a language isolate that is not related to the Indo European languages 

The ancestors of Basques are among the oldest residents of Europe and their beginnings are still unknown as are the origins of Basque itself Many scholars have tried to link Basque to Etruscan African languages Caucasian languages and so on but most see Basque as a language isolate A connection with the Iberian language gave some hope but it is unclear whether similarities are due to genetic relations or mere vicinity It was spoken long before the Romans brought Latin to the Iberian Peninsula However it is probable that basque is not completely isolated and belongs to an old super family

The region where Basque is spoken is smaller than what is known as the Basque Country or Euskal Herria in Basque Basque used to be spoken over a larger area but Latin took over in some places

Historically Latin or Romance has been the official language

Today Basque holds co official language status in the Basque regions of Spain the full autonomous community of the Basque Country and some parts of Navarre Basque has no official standing in the Northern Basque Country of France and French citizens are barred from using Basque in a French court of law

There are six main Basque dialects comprising Biscayan Guipuzcoan and High Navarrese and Low Navarrese Labourdin and Souletin The dialect boundaries are not however congruent with political boundaries One of the first scientific studies of Basque dialects in particular the auxiliary verb forms was made by Louis Lucien Bonaparte

There is now a unified version of Euskara called Batua which is the language taught in schools Batua is based largely on the Gipuzkoa regional dialect

Basque is an ergative absolutive language It is very complicated having many different cases for nouns

The vowel system is the same as Spanish for most speakers It consists of five pure vowels i e a o u It is thought that Spanish took this system from Basque 

By contact with neighbouring peoples Basque has borrowed words from Latin Spanish French Gascon among others but accepted relatively few compared to many Indo European languages Some claim that many of its words come from Latin but phonetic evolution has made many of them appear nowadays as if they were native words eg lore errota gela

Basque is written using the Latin alphabet The universal special letter is which is pronounced like the n in onion sometimes and are also used Basque does not use c q v w y except for loan words they are not considered part of the alphabet The X is pronounced as a sh as in shine

Chlorine is a chemical element Its atomic number is 17 and its atomic mass is 3545 It is part of the 7th column on the periodic table of elements 

Chlorine is very irritating and greenish yellow gas It has a strong smell like bleach It is toxic It can be made into a liquid when cooled It is heavier than air

Chlorine is highly reactive It is more reactive than bromine but less reactive than fluorine It reacts with most things to make chlorides It can even burn things instead of oxygen It dissolves in water to make a mixture of hypochlorous acid and hydrochloric acid The more acidic it is the more chlorine is made the more basic it is the more hypochlorous acid and hydrochloric acid are there Chlorine reacts with bromides and iodides to make bromine and iodine 

It exists in several oxidation states 1 1 3 4 5 and 7 The 1 state is most often in chloride Chlorides are not reactive The 1 state is in hypochlorites It is a strong oxidizing agent as are all oxidation state compounds 3 is in chlorites 4 is in chlorine dioxide a common chlorine compound that is not a chloride 5 is in chlorates 7 is in perchlorates Hypochlorites are most reactive while perchlorates are the least reactive

Many organic compounds have chlorine in them Freon has chlorine in it PVC a common plastic has chlorine in it 

Chlorine oxides can be made but most of them are very reactive and unstable

 FilePVC pressurejpgPVC pipe a plastic that has chlorine in it FileHaliteUSGOVjpgSodium chloride FileKClO3jpgPotassium chlorate FilePerclorato de PotssiojpgPotassium perchlorate 

Chlorine is not found as an element Sodium chloride is the most common chlorine ore It is in the ocean and in the ground There are some organic compounds that have chlorine in them too

It is made by electrolysis of sodium chloride This is known as the chloralkali process It can also be made by reacting hydrogen chloride with oxygen and a catalyst It can be made in the laboratory by reacting manganese dioxide with hydrochloric acid It is made when sodium hypochlorite reacts with hydrochloric acid This is a dangerous reaction that can happen without anyone knowing

Chlorine is used widely to purify water as a disinfectant and bleach and in the making of many important compounds including chloroform and carbon tetrachloride It was used as a poison gas in some wars

It was discovered in 1774 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele who thought it had oxygen in it Chlorine was named in 1810 by Humphry Davy who insisted it was an element The US made all water chlorinated by 1918

It is poisonous in large amounts and can damage skin When it is inhaled it irritates the lungs eyes and skin badly It can cause fire with some things because it is very reactive It is heavier than air so it can fill up enclosed spaces

The halogens are chemical elements under the second to right column in the periodic table also known as Group 17 The elements in the group are fluorine chlorine bromine iodine astatine and ununseptium Halogen literally means salt becomer but it is often cited to mean salt producer They are very reactive so they are likely to join with other elements on the left side of the periodic table to make compounds This is due to the fact that they are missing one electron They are rarely found alone in nature except astatine which is not found in nature Fluorine is the most reactive while iodine is the least reactive Astatine is very radioactive and hard to get FileF9jpgFluorine FileChlorinejpgChlorine FileBrominejpgBromine FileIodine samplejpgIodine 

A vitamin is a chemical compound that is needed for the human body to work correctly They include Vitamin A many B vitamins Vitamin C Vitamin D Vitamin E and Vitamin K For example citrus fruits such as oranges and lemons contain vitamin C

Many vitamins can not be made by the body itself The body needs to get them from other places usually through food A short term lack of a certain vitamin is usually not a problem as the body is able to store vitamins for a short time Not having a certain vitamin for a longer period of time can lead to different diseases depending on the lacking vitamin Probably the best known of these diseases is scurvy which results from not having enough Vitamin C 

Today many pharmaceutical companies make inexpensive pills that contain various vitamins These pills are sold as a supplement

Currently there are no vitamins F to J These existed at some time Today they are either reclassified Some of them were also false leads and turned out to be something else Some were also renamed because they are close to Vitamin B Today the B vitamins are a whole complex and not just one vitamin 

Adultery is a word used in religious texts and in laws It applies to a married couple and in the past meant that the man of the couple left his wife for another woman usually to have sexual intercourse with that woman that is not his wife Adultery usually comes with a heavy punishment In most countries adultery is no longer a crime but most people still see it as a bad thing If a person who is married takes part in adultery that persons husband or wife would usually have the right to be able to go to court to divorce that person

Adultery is the voluntary sexual intercourse between a married person and another person who is not that persons spouse 

The word adultery originates not from adult as is commonly thought in English speaking countries but from the Late Latin word for to alter corrupt adulterare Adulterare in turn is formed by the combination of ad and alter together with the infinitive form are Thus the meaning is literally to make other In contrast the word adult comes from another Latin root adolescere meaning to grow up or mature a combination of ad alere and the inchoative infix sc

Perjury is the word used for a person tells a lie while they are under oath Committing perjury is against the law and can be punished with a jail or prison sentence

Lust is a term for a strong desire or wanting or maybe even needing often for sexual acts although it is also commonly used to talk of a lust for life or a lust for power or for other goals

As a sexual desire it is considered a vice by Christianity which lists it as one of the seven deadly sins

Lust was originally an Anglo Saxon word which meant desire or appetite 

Some followers of Christianity say that there are sins that are worse to commit than others There are seven sins that it calls deadly Although the Bible never actually states that there are seven deadly sins these are the sins that are stated in the Divine Comedy

Ranked in a growing order of severity like in Dantes Divine Comedy the seven deadly sins are

People see that some of those sins are connected They have tried to put an order to them For example pride is needed for gluttony as well as sloth envy and most of the others Each of those sins is a way to not loving god and to not loving the others as much as oneself The Scholastic theologians developed schema of attribute and substance of will to explain these sins 

As previously mentioned the Latin words for the sins are superbia avaritia luxuria invidia gula ira and accidia The first letters of these words form the medieval Latin word saligia whence the verb saligiare is taken Various mnemonic devices exist for remembering the sins in English eg PEGS LAW

In the official Catechism of the Catholic Church consisting of 2865 numbered sections and first published in 1992 by order of Pope John Paul II the seven deadly sins are dealt with in one paragraph The principal codification of moral transgression for Christians continues to be the Ten Commandments and the Beatitudes which are a positive statement of morality and part of the Sermon on the Mount

The opposite of these sins are the seven virtues in corresponding order to the above seven deadly sins

According to the Divine Comedy there are punishments for those who die with unconfessed deadly sins

The Lustfuls are in the second circle of the Inferno There they are blown around by a strong wind without the hope of ever resting This is because lust is so powerful that it can blow one around without need or aim

The Gluttons are in the third circle There they are forced to lie in a kind of slush made by freezing rain black snow and hail This used to symbolize what they made with their life

The Greedy are in the fourth circle There they are boiled in hot oil its best best oil that money can buy but its still pretty hot and you will be turned into gold

The Slothful are in the fifth circle There they are thrown into a snake pit where the indolent will have to move around to get the snakes off them eternally

The Wrathful are in the sixth circle There their limbs are ripped apart which makes absolute sense since the furious use their arms andor legs in their act of violence

Bromine is a chemical element Its atomic number is 35 and its atomic weight is 80 It is part of the Group 7 elements on the periodic table It is diatomic which means that two atoms are stuck together to make a molecule in any bromine sample

Bromine is a red brown liquid Liquid elements are rare only bromine and mercury are liquid at room temperature It easily evaporates to make suffocating brown fumes It has a bad smell Its name means stench of he goats It can become a metal at very high pressures

It has two stable isotopes They are 79Br and 81Br There are about 29 other radioactive isotopes 

Bromine is quite reactive Its reactivity is between chlorine which is more reactive and iodine which is less reactive It reacts with metals and nonmetals Phosphorus reacts violently with bromine Aluminum reacts in a similar way It can bleach things like chlorine It reacts better in the light It dissolves a little in water Hot water makes it disproportionate into hydrobromic acid and hypobromous acid Bromide can form compounds with substances such as sodium to form sodium bromide

 FileSodium bromidejpgSodium bromide FilePotassium bromidejpgPotassium bromide FileBrominan sodnJPGSodium bromate 

Bromine is found as bromide in the ocean and in brine pools The Dead Sea has very much bromide in it Bromine is not an important part of our body unlike its relatives chlorine and iodine 

Bromine is made by bubbling chlorine gas through a solution of a bromide The bromide is oxidized to bromine while the chlorine is reduced to chloride 

It is mainly used to make organobromine compounds organic compounds with bromine in them Organobromines are used to put out fires They used to be added to gasoline Some were used as pesticides Some inorganic bromides were used as sedatives Bromine can also be used as a disinfectant Silver bromide is used in film

Bromine is toxic and corrosive to skin Bromine gas is irritating when it is breathed in too Bromine can react violently with many things

Fluorine is a chemical element Its atomic number is 9 and its atomic mass is 19 It is part of the Group 7 on the periodic table of elements

Fluorine is a light yellow diatomic gas It is very reactive gas which exists as diatomic molecules It is actually the most reactive element Fluorine has a very high attraction for electrons because it is missing one This makes it the most powerful oxidizing agent It can rip electrons from water and ignite propane on contact It does not need a spark Metals can catch on fire when placed in a stream of fluorine After it is reduced by reacting with other things it forms the stable fluoride ion Fluorine is very poisonous Fluorine bonds very strongly with carbon It can react with the unreactive noble gases It explodes when mixed with hydrogen The melting point of fluorine is 36333F the boiling point is 30662F

Fluorine is not found as an element on the earth it is much too reactive Several fluorides are found in the earth though When calcium phosphate is reacted with sulfuric acid to make phosphoric acid some hydrofluoric acid is produced Also fluorite can be reacted with sulfuric acid to make hydrofluoric acid Is a luiquid of fluoride U Fluorine naturally occurs on the earths crust in rocks coal and clay

Fluorine is normally made by electrolysis Hydrogen fluoride is dissolved in potassium fluoride This mixture is melted and an electric current is passed through it This is electrolysis Hydrogen is produced at one side and fluorine at the other side If the sides are not separated the cell may explode

Someone made fluorine in 1986 without using electrolysis They produced manganese fluoride by using various chemical compounds which released fluorine gas

Fluorine is used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons It is also used to make sulfur hexafluoride Sulfur hexafluoride is used to propel stuff out of an aerosol can It is also used to make integrated circuits Fluorine compounds have many uses Fluoride ions are in fluorine compounds Fluoride ions can be in toothpaste Some are used in nonstick coatings Freons contain fluorine

Fluorine as an element is extremely reactive and toxic It can react with almost everything even glass Fluorine is also poisonous

Fluoride ions are somewhat toxic If too much toothpaste containing fluoride is eaten then fluoride poisoning may occur Fluoride is not reactive though

Iodine is a chemical element Its atomic number is 53 and its atomic mass is 127 It is part of the Group 7 on the periodic table of elements and its electronic configuration is 2818187 It is a nonmetal 

Iodine is a dark purple black solid It is also a nonmetal and a halogen It evaporates when heated to make a bright purple vapor This vapor is very irritating although colorful Iodine does not dissolve in water but it does dissolve in a solution of an iodide in water It dissolves easily in organic solvents

Iodine is at the bottom of the halogens and is the least reactive of the halogens Iodine is an oxidizing agent though not as strong as bromine or chlorine It can be reduced to the colorless iodide ion Iodine reacts with hydrogen sulfide or hydrazine to make hydriodic acid Iodine dissolves in oleum to make a bright blue solution of I2 and sulfur dioxide This cation is also made when iodine reacts with antimony pentafluoride 

Iodine reacts with bases to make hypoiodite and iodide The hypoiodite disproportionates to iodate and iodide Iodine reacts with nitric acid and chlorates to make iodates too Iodine reacts violently with some metals like aluminium to make large amounts of heat and toxic vapors 

Iodine forms chemical compounds in several oxidation states 1 1 3 5 and 7 This is typical of the halogens except for fluorine 1 compounds as iodides are the most common Most organic iodine compounds are in the 1 oxidation state 1 compounds are found as iodine monochloride and hypoiodites 3 compounds are found as iodine trichloride 5 compounds are found as iodates and iodic acid Iodine pentafluoride and iodine pentoxide are iodine compounds in the 5 state 7 compounds are normally found as periodates and periodic acid Iodine heptafluoride is also in the 7 oxidation state

Potassium iodide is one of the most common iodides Iodides are normally colorless but turn yellow after being in air because the iodide is oxidized to iodine Iodides react with acidified manganese dioxide or chlorine to make iodine Iodine monochloride is a red or brown liquid Iodine trichloride as well as iodine trifluoride are yellow solids Iodates like potassium iodate are colorless solids similar to chlorates Iodic acid is the only stable oxidizing halogen acid Chloric acid by comparison is very unstable and dangerous Iodine pentoxide is a white solid and iodine pentafluoride is a yellowish liquid Periodates like sodium periodate are colorless solids similar to perchlorates although weaker oxidizing agents They decompose to iodates when they are heated Periodic acid is not as stable as iodic acid Iodine heptafluoride is the only iodine compound

It was discovered by Barnard Courtois in 1811 He burned seaweed to get sodium carbonate and reacted the residue with sulfuric acid One time he poured too much sulfuric acid on the seaweed and purple vapor came out which made dark blue black crystals on a cold surface He did not have enough money to see whether it was a new element or not He gave samples to several chemists who identified it as an element in 1813

Iodine is too reactive to be in nature as an element Iodine compounds are not common in the ground There is a mineral called caliche that is found in dry deserts It has iodate in it Iodide is found in seawater Kelp has quite large amounts of iodine in it Iodine is one of the heaviest elements needed by living things If we do not get enough of it we get a disease known as goitre Most salt has iodine in it in the form of iodide or iodate We can also take iodine pills to make sure we get enough

Kelp was burned and the iodine extracted from the ashes in the 18th and 19th century but now it is not good enough for common use Most iodine now is gotten from seawater Chlorine is reacted with seawater to change the iodide to iodine Air is blown over the water to evaporate the iodine Then the iodine is reduced with sulfur dioxide to hydriodic acid Then the hydriodic acid is oxidized with chlorine again to make iodine This process is repeated until the iodine is pure 

A very pure form of iodine is made by reacting copper sulfate and potassium iodide This makes copper iodide which is not stable It breaks down into copper iodide and iodine which is pure

Iodine is used as a catalyst for making acetic acid Animal feed also has iodine in it for nutrition Iodine is used for a disinfectant Tincture of iodine is a common iodine disinfectant Iodine can be used to prevent thyroid cancer after a nuclear explosion After a nuclear explosion radioactive iodine fills the air The radioactive iodine easily goes into the thyroid and causes cancer When people take iodine tablets it fills up the thyroid with non radioactive iodine which prevents any radioactive iodine from coming in

Iodine compounds can be used in X rays because X rays cannot go through them easily Some metals are purified using their iodides Silver iodide is used in photographic film and cloud seeding Erythrosine is a food coloring that has iodine in it Iodine can be used to make illegal drugs so it is restricted in some areas Iodine can be used as a test for reducing agents Iodine turns colorless when mixed with a reducing agent Iodine also turns black when mixed with starch Iodides become colored when mixed with oxidizing agents

Iodine can irritate skin Its vapors are irritating to the lungs It is less toxic than the other halogens though 2 3 grams of iodine can kill Iodides are only toxic in large amounts

Astatine is a chemical element Its atomic number is 85 and its atomic weight is 210 It is part of the Group 7 on the periodic table of elements Some of its isotopes may be in nature But because it is extremely unstable only about an ounce exists in the Earths crust at one point in time It is radioactive The longest living isotope 210AT has a half life of a bit over eight hours

The nucleus is the middle part of an atom It is made of protons and neutrons and is surrounded by the electron cloud The nucleus has most of the mass of an atom though it is only a very small part of it

Neutrons have no charge and protons are all positively charged Because the nucleus is only made up of protons and neutrons it is positively charged Things that have the same charge repel each other Unless there was something else holding the nucleus together it could not exist because the protons would push away from each other The nucleus is actually held together by a force called the strong nuclear force 

The strong nuclear force is a force that can only act over extremely short ranges 

The United States House of Representatives is a part of the United States Congress Congress is the legislature of the U S government and makes federal laws The other part of Congress is the U S Senate There are maximum 435 members in the United States House of Representatives These members are called U S Representatives or just representatives Congress is debating about having 450 members instead of 435factdateJuly 2010

The number of representatives from each state depends on the number of people in that state but there is at least one U S representative from each of the 50 states The House of Representatives is in one of the two wings in the US Capitol building The other wing is for the Senate Sometimes the House of Representatives is informally called the House The chairmanchairperson in the US House of Representatives is called the Speaker of the House The term of the Speaker of the House is two years in office The current Speaker is John Boehner The first female Speaker of the House was Nancy Pelosi She was elected to the House of Representatives in 1987 Pelosi became Speaker on January 4th 2007

According to the US Constitution all bills about raising revenue which includes taxes must start in the House of Representatives Also the House of Representatives has the sole power to impeach certain officials such as the president or federal judges According to the US Constitution the House of Representatives can expel one of its representatives by a vote of at least two thirds of its members

Novels are works of prose fiction They are longer than short stories There are many kinds For example some are adventures stories like Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson There are horror stories like Mary Shelleys Frankenstein There are also science fiction novels and humorous novels like Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain Novels in English are usually 50000 words or more and have 100 pages or more

There are many different genres or categories of novels Some of these are

Fiction is any literature that is not completely true It is made up by the author The opposite of fiction is non fiction writing that deals with only true events Often in a library part of the library is for fiction books and another part of the library is for non fiction

The word fiction comes from the Latin word fictum which means created This is a good way to remember what fiction is if it has been created or made up by somebody it is fiction Fiction can be written or told or acted on stage in a movie on television or radio Usually the purpose of fiction is to entertain

However fiction does not need to be totally made up often it has real places or people in it This is to make it seem real to the reader Fiction with real people or events in it is sometimes called historical fiction because it is based on things that happened in history This type of fiction is written so that we can imagine and understand what it was like when those people were alive

In fiction there are always characters There is usually a protagonist or hero Sometimes this is a group of people not one person You usually support the hero The protagonist has to face some kind of enemy usually another character called the antagonist The fight between the protagonist and their enemy is called the conflict

The story of how the hero faces this enemy is called the plot There is usually a beginning climax and ending to the plot 

The climax is the most dangerous and exciting part of the plot For example if you were on a rollercoaster the highest part would be the climax The climax usually near to the end of the story because the whole story has been building up to it It is the point when the hero looks like they are about to lose and they are in the greatest danger After the climax something usually happens to help the hero win This is often very hard to predict so it is a big surprise

Conflict is very important in fiction Every work of fiction needs a conflict or problem There are five basic types of conflict In modern times a new one Person vs Technology has been used

Person vs Self is when a character is facing his own fears confusion or philosophy Sometimes the character tries to find out who he or she is and comes to realize it or change it Sometimes the character struggles to find out what is right or wrong Although the enemy is inside the character they can be influenced by outside forces The struggle of the human being to come to a decision is the base of this type of conflict

Person vs Person is when the hero is fighting another person There is usually more than one time that the hero meets the enemy For example if a child is being bullied that is person vs person conflict An example is the conflict between Judah and Messala in Ben Hur

Person vs Society is when the heros main source of conflict is traditions or ideas The protagonist is basically fighting what is wrong with the world he lives in Society itself is often treated as a single character just as another person is in person vs person conflict An example in literature would be Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront

Person vs Nature is when a character is fighting against forces of nature Many films focus on this theme It is also found in stories about trying to survive in places far away from humans like Jack Londons short story To Build a Fire

Person vs Supernatural is when a character is battling supernatural forces Sometimes this force is inside themselves it is internal Such stories are sometimes used to represent or criticize Freuds theory of id vs superego Bram Stokers Dracula is a good example of this as well as Frankenstein by Mary Shelley and Christabel by Samuel Coleridge It is also very common in comic books

Person vs MachineTechnology places a character against robot forces with artificial intelligence I Robot and the Terminator series are good examples of this conflict

Fossil fuels are fuels that are hydrocarbons These fuels are found in rock formations that also contain fossils Some people believe that the carbon in these fuels comes from decaying plants and animals that lived millions of years ago

The three most important fossil fuels are coal oil and natural gas They originate from very old life forms that decomposed over a long period of time

Fossil fuels can be used to make electricity in a power plant They are burned to heat water into steam which can push a fan like object called a turbine When the turbine turns around magnets in it make electricity This is the best thing about it scientist Loren Boylan says that without these fossil fuels our world would have not evolved in the way our economy has

People also burn fossil fuels to heat their homes Coal is not used as much as it used to be because it produces a lot of pollution In many homes people burn natural gas in a stove to cook food a By fractional distillation or separating a mixture into different things by boiling oil can be separated into smaller substances like LPG gasoline kerosene jet fuel and diesel fuel

Also fossil fuels are used in transportation In other words they are burned in order to move cars trucks ships airplaces and even spacecraft Fossil fuel has become an important part of modern society and without it society would stop moving 

These fossil fuels are also widely used in construction In the oil sands in alberta about 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas was used per day in 2007 in order to heat up the soil for the oil to be taken from the earth

Fossil fuels produce a lot of pollution when burned This pollution is responsible for causing the earth to get warmer called global warming They are also non renewable resources there is only a limited amount of coal gas and oil and it is not possible to make more Eventually all the fossil fuels will be used Scientists think that coal will have run out by 2230 and oil by 2030 Scientists are looking at ways of using renewable energy sources like biomass energy such as wood Countries are also increasing the use of wind power tidal energy and solar energy to generate electricity Some governments are helping automobile makers to develop electric cars and hybrid cars that will use less oil It is estimated that in 40 years all the oil in the world will run out and in 60 years all the natural gas will run out and in 300 years all the coal will run out

The Boston Bruins are an ice hockey team in the National Hockey League They were the first American team in the NHL in 1924 They have won six Stanley Cup championships and they are the defending champions

In their early years the Bruins won three Stanley Cups 1929 1939 and 1941 Ralph Cooney Weiland won the Art Ross Trophy as scoring champion in 1930 Aubrey Dit Clapper was also a star player around this time Then Eddie Shore came along a huge star in the league on defense Shore won the Hart Trophy as most valuable player four times in 1933 1935 1936 and 1938 Only Gordie Howe and Wayne Gretzky have won it more often Cecil Tiny Thompson was the teams star goaltender

In the 1940s and 1950s the Bruins had new stars Milt Schmidt and Bill Cowley were great centers and both won scoring championships and MVP trophies They were helped by Woody Dumart and Bobby Bauer on wing and Frank Brimsek replaced Thompson in goal

The 1960s were not so good for the Bruins Schmidt retired to become the teams coach and the team did not have many stars They finished in last place six times out of seven years and did not make the playoffs eight straight seasons Left wing John Bucyk was their best player

Bobby Orr began as a defenseman with Boston in 1966 After his rookie season he won the Norris Trophy as best defenseman in the NHL eight times in a row and the Bruins became a top team again He joined with centers Phil Esposito and Derek Sanderson Bucyk and goalie Gerry Cheevers to lead the Bruins to the Stanley Cup in 1970 and 1972 Orr won the Conn Smythe Trophy as MVP in the playoffs both years He also won the Hart Trophy in 1970 1971 and 1972 Esposito won it in 1969 and 1974 Esposito won five Art Ross Trophies 1969 1971 1972 1973 and 1974 Orr won it in 1970 and 1975 the only defenseman ever to win the scoring title The Bruins continued to be a strong team through the late 1970s 1980s and early 1990s 

Ray Bourque who won the Norris Trophy five times was the teams greatest star in the 1980s and 1990s He is the teams top career scorer and the highest scoring defenseman in NHL history The Bruins won the Presidents Cup as regular season champions in 1983 and 1990 and made the Stanley Cup finals in 1988 and 1990 Cam Neely was an important player until the mid 1990s and Joe Thornton was a top scorer until he was traded to the San Jose Sharks in 2005 The Bruins won the Stanley Cup championship in 2011

George Morrow was part of the early microcomputer industry in the United States Morrow promoted and improved the S 100 bus used in many early microcomputers Morrow was also a member of the Homebrew Computer Club

Starting in 1976 he designed and sold computers computer parts and accessories under several company names including Morrow Designs Morrows companies built microcomputers that used the CPM operating system When IBM started selling their IBM PC personal computer in 1981 Morrow and other CPM computer makers had trouble competing Morrow Designs filed for bankruptcy in 1986

Dietary minerals are the chemical elements that living things need to have be part of what they eat other than the four elements carbon hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen which are already very common in living things

One of the best known examples is calcium which humans and many other animals need to build strong bones and teeth among other thingsRed meat is rich in iron which is a well known mineral it is important for us to have iron as it creates red blood cells

Cleveland was a non metropolitan county in North East England The districts which made up the county are now all unitary authorities

Hungarian is a Finno Ugric language which is a member of the Uralic language family

The group of Finno Ugric languages also includes Finnish Estonian Lappic and some other languages spoken in the Russian Federation Out of these it is Khanty and Mansi that are the most closely related to Hungarian The Hungarian name for the language is magyar

Hungarian is spoken by about 14 million people Most of its speakers live in Hungary and Romania but it is also spoken in Slovakia the northern part of Serbia Ukraine and other countries Hungarian is the official language of the Republic of Hungary and one of the official languages of the EU It is also an official language of the Autonomous Republic of Vojvodina and of some places in the Republic of Slovenia Hungarians call their language magyar

Hungarian has several dialects but they are not too different to make understanding difficult The only such example may be the dialect of the Csngs of Romania That dialect is an old and archaic version of the language 

Hungarian literary language is based on the Northeastern dialect

Hungarian grammar is rather different from the grammar of Indo European languages People may find this grammar complicated in the first time if they speak an Indo European language until they realize that it works along some pretty logical rules 

Hungarian has no grammatical gender For example there are no separate words for he and she but there is one pronoun Instead of prepositions Hungarian has suffixes From Budapest becomes Budapestrl and with Alexandra becomes Alexandrval in Hungarian Another feature of the language is vowel harmony This means that suffixes must tone in with the vowel of the main word To over simplify it if they have an a in the word then the suffix will also contain an a and if their word has an e then its suffix too will get an e In Hungarian they must put the stress always on the first syllable of the words

Although Hungarian is not an Indo European language its lexicon has many words from Slavic and Turkic languages and also from German

Hungarian is written in the Latin alphabet Some letters have accents so while the English alphabet has 26 letters Hungarian has 44 The writing of Hungarian is largely phonetic This means that each letter has its own pronunciation and it is easy to read any text once they learn how the letters are pronounced

The earliest known written Hungarian words are to be found in a Latin document the Foundation Charter of the Abbey of Tihany The Funeral Oration and Prayer and Old Hungarian Lament of Mary are the earliest known continuous Hungarian texts In the 16th century the first printed Hungarian texts came out Modern Hungarian literary language appeared in the 18th and 19th centuries Hungarian replaced Latin as the official language of Hungary first between 1844 and 1849 and then in 1867

Hungarian can mean

Animal husbandry is the taking care of and breeding of animals particularly livestock Animal husbandry has been around for over 20000 years In rural areas and less developed countries parents often teach their children how to care for their farm animals 4H is an organization that also teaches children how to raise and care for farm animals

Some people who specialize in animal husbandry try to make sure that the animals are well cared for while others try to make sure that the animals cost as little as possible to raise

Examples of animal husbandry are

The Walt Disney World Resort also called Walt Disney World or Disney World is near Orlando Florida United States It opened on October 1 1971 with only the Magic Kingdom theme park and has since added Epcot Disneys Hollywood Studios and Disneys Animal Kingdom It also has two water parks 23 hotels a campground and Downtown Disney which is a shopping area with souvenir shops restaurants and sports activities

The resort was inspired by the dreams of Walt Disney and his creation of Disneyland in California Its original theme park Magic Kingdom is designed similarly to Disneyland Walt Disney created Disney World to have a vacation resort that was much different from Disneylands one day visit this includes a much wider variety of sports recreation themed resort hotels and entertainment

Walt Disney World Resort is owned and operated by the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts segment of The Walt Disney Company 

 Theme Parks 

 Magic Kingdom 

The Magic Kingdom is a theme park based on themed lands After entering the park gates guests enter into the first land Main Street USA At the end of Main Street USA is Cinderella Castle Roads go in different directions in front of Cinderella Castle so that the park is in the shape of a wheel Other lands in Magic Kingdom are Adventureland Frontierland Fantasyland Tomorrowland and Liberty Square Famous rides in the Magic Kingdom include Space Mountain Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Jungle Cruise Pirates of the Caribbean and The Hall of Presidents The Magic Kingdom also hosts a parade called Spectromagic and a fireworks display called Wishes The Magic Kingdom is the most visited theme park in the world

 Epcot 

Epcot is a theme park with two parts The first part is Future World Future World has rides that combine entertainment and education Some famous rides in Future World are Spaceship Earth Test Track and Soarin The other part of Epcot is the World Showcase The World Showcase has examples of countries from around the world These examples have traditional buildings from those countries traditional foods from those countries and traditional gifts from those countries The people who work in the examples are usually from the country Some of the countries that are in the World Showcase are Mexico Norway England France Italy Germany Japan and China

Epcot was going to be a city when Walt Disney was planning it but planners changed it to a theme park after his death The name Epcot was an acronym for Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow

 Disneys Hollywood Studios 

Disneys Hollywood Studios was originally called Disney MGM Studios and was an actual movie and TV studio Now the park is mostly a theme park The theme park is based on movies and television and the rides are usually based on this theme Examples of famous rides in Disney Hollywood Studios are The Hollywood Tower of Terror Rockn Roller Coaster Toy Story Mania Star Tours and The Great Movie Ride Disneys Hollywood Studios also features many shows most of which focus on movies and television shows

The harp is a musical instrument It is the second biggest string instrument in an orchestra It dates back to 4000 BC when the Egyptians used them in holy places Christian artists often draw angels playing harps in Heaven

All harps must have strings Each string must be tight so it makes the right sound or note for that string The strings are tied to the frame

The frame is usually a wood triangle It must be strong so that the many tight strings do not break it

The side of the triangle that leans on the players body is the sound box Empty boxes can make sounds louder 

The top side of the triangle has a lot of pegs in it There is one peg for each string on the harp The top of each string is tied to one peg and twisted around the peg The player turns the peg to make the string more tight or less tight This is how the player makes each string make the right note The bottom of each string is tied to the sound box

The last side of the triangle is called the pillar The oldest harps from Egypt did not have pillars If the strings were too tight they would break the harp Adding a pillar to a harp frame makes the frame very strong so that the strings will not break it

Harp players pluck the strings with their fingers This makes the strings move so that the strings make sounds Each string sound is a different musical note Harp players play songs by plucking the strings in the right order and at the right time More than one string can be plucked at the same time When the harp player wants a note to stop they touch that string softly so that it stops moving

There are many different kinds of harps The two main kinds are folk harps and pedal harps

Folk harps are the older kind of harp Each string makes one note They are usually tuned so that playing each string in order sounds like playing all the white notes on a piano in order This is called a diatonic scale In some places they are tuned so that playing each string in order sounds like playing all the black notes on a piano in order This is called a pentatonic scale

Folk harps can be found in many different sizes The smallest ones can be less than half a meter tall The biggest ones can be almost 15 meters tall and have a foot so they can stand on the ground by themselves They can be too big to be lifted by one person

The number of strings varies on folk harps from less than 20 to more than 40

Pedal harps were invented during the 1800s CE by a man in France This is the kind of harp that is used in a Symphony Orchestra Pedal harps are about two meters tall and have about 50 strings The lowest and highest notes on a pedal harp are the same as the lowest and highest notes on a piano They are very heavy and need more than one person to move them The frame is usually made out of metal

The pedal harp is tuned like the white keys on a piano There are seven pedals to let the harp player play songs in different musical keys Each pedal has three places For the A pedal place 1 makes all the A strings on the harp sound like A flat Place 2 makes all the A strings sound like a normal A Place 3 makes all the A strings sound like A sharp 

Cross strung harps are chromatic and consist of two rows of strings They cross near to the middle of the string without touching The strings are in the order of the piano keys or in the order of the 6 plus 6 system

Some instruments have the word harp in their name but they are not really harps The harp is such an old musical instrument that people sometimes say harp when they mean any kind of instrument

A joule is a unit in the SI system That means that scientists use it It measures the work being done It is named after James Prescott Joule 

A joule equals one newton multiplied by a meter It is related to the watt one watt equals one joule per second

Carl Friedrich Gauss was a famous mathematician from Gttingen Germany Gauss contributed to many areas of learning Most of his work was about number theory and astronomy 

The Duke of Brunswick gave Gauss a fellowship to the Collegium Carolinum where he attended from 1792 to 1795 This meant that the Duke paid for the education of Carl Friedrich Gauss at the Collegium After this Gauss went to the University of Gttingen from 1795 to 1798

When Gauss was 23 scientists spotted the asteroid Ceres but they did not see it for long enough to know its orbit Gauss made calculations that let them locate it

Later in life Gauss stopped working on pure math and turned to physics He did work in electromagnetism

Gauss wrote Disquisitiones Arithmeticae which is a book about number theory In that book he proved the law of Quadratic reciprocity He also was the first mathematician to explain Modular arithmetic in a very detailed way Before Gauss mathematicians had used modular arithmetic in some cases but did not know much about using it broadly 

The Grand Canyon is a famous canyon in Arizona formed by the Colorado River It is a national park of the United States and a UNESCO World Heritage Site 

The Grand Canyon is 277 miles long up to 18 miles wide and is over a mile deep in places Nearly two billion years of the Earths geological history have been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut their channels through layer after layer of rock while the Colorado Plateau was uplifted 

Evidence suggests the Colorado River established its course through the canyon at least 17 million years ago Since that time the Colorado River continued to erode and form the canyon to the point we see it at today

Many people come from around the world to visit the Grand Canyon People can also take trips floating on the Colorado River in boats and rafts Some people like to hike in the Grand Canyon The land on the north side of the Grand Canyon is called the North Rim The land on the south side of the Grand Canyon is called the South Rim There are trails leading from the North Rim and the South Rim to the bottom of the canyon These trails lead to a place at the bottom of the canyon called Phantom Ranch Phantom Ranch has a campground and cabins where hikers can spend the night Some people also ride mules into the Grand Canyon Most people who visit the Grand Canyon drive in cars to the South Rim and just look at the canyon from the rim and take pictures

Alberto Fujimori was the President of Peru from 1990 2000

He is still remembered in Peru for defeating Shinning Path the peace with Ecuador and recovering the economy after the presidency of Alan Garca

In 2001 Fujimoris head of intelligence Vladimiro Montesinos was accused of doing illegal things People thought that Fujimori was also involved After that Fujimori resigned to the Presidency of Peru

Valentn Paniagua was elected president by the Congress soon after Fujimori resigned Fujimori went to Japan because he is a citizen there Japan protected him from Peruvian law since they do not find any valid accusation

In 2005 Fujimori was detained in Chile The Peruvian government is now trying to bring him back to Peru in order to have him face trial

This is a list of Presidents of Peru

The New York Rangers are an ice hockey team in the National Hockey League They play in Madison Square Garden in New York City The team began in 1926 and has won four Stanley Cup championships

The Rangers were successful in their early years winning the Stanley Cup in 1928 1933 and 1940 Bill Cook won the Art Ross Trophy as scoring leader in 1927 and 1933 and Bryan Hextall won it in 1942 Babe Pratt was a star defenceman around this time

The Rangers did very poorly in the mid 1940s but improved by 1950 when they lost the Stanley Cup final in overtime of the deciding game seven to the Detroit Red Wings Buddy OConnor won the Hart Trophy as most valuable player in 1948 goaltender Chuck Rayner won it in 1950 and Andy Bathgate won it in 1959

The team did not make the finals again until 1972 when they lost to the Boston Bruins They were led by players such as Jean Ratelle Brad Park Ed Giacomin and Rod Gilbert The Rangers made the finals again in 1979 losing to the Montreal Canadians

There was another team in New York the Americans The Americans felt that the Rangers were favoured by Madison Square Garden and that their team folded in 1942 because of the Rangers The Americans coach and general manager Red Dutton claimed the Rangers would never win another Stanley Cup as long as he lived This became known as Duttons curse

Red Dutton died in 1987 and his curse came true Finally the Rangers improved winning the Presidents Cup as regular season champions in 1992 and 1994 Mark Messier won the Hart Trophy in 1992 and Brian Leetch won two Norris Trophies as best defence They led the Rangers to the Stanley Cup in 1994 after 54 years of not winning

Recently the Rangers have been a poor team missing the playoffs many years in a row However in 2005 06 the team has improved again much due to the play of star Jaromir Jagr and rookie goalie Henrik Lundquist

Plasma makes up about 55 of the total blood volume It is mostly water and contains dissolved proteins glucose clotting factors mineral ions hormones and carbon dioxide Plasma is the transport medium for excretion 

In hospitals blood plasma is prepared like this An anti coagulant stops the blood clotting Then tubes of blood are spun very fast in a centrifuge The blood cells go to the bottom of the tubes The plasma is poured into another container 

Hospitals may give patients

Blood serum is blood plasma without fibrinogen or the other clotting factors

Plasmapheresis is a medical therapy which involves taking out blood plasma treating it and putting it back in the patient

Whole plasma may be stored frozen or it may be stored dry Dried plasma can be flown anywhere in the world and is vital for the armed forces The method was invented in the USA in 1940 and used widely in World War II The ArmyNavy standard pack was two tin cans each with 400cc bottles inside One held the plasma the other distilled water The plasma could be restored in three minutes and remained fresh for about four hours 

The Vancouver Canucks are an ice hockey team in the National Hockey League

The Canucks were first an amateur team in the Pacific Coast Hockey League winning the championship in 1946 and 1948 In 1952 the PCHL joined with the Western Canada Senior Hockey League to form the minor league Western Hockey League The Canucks won the championship in this league in 1958 1960 1969 and 1970

The Canucks joined the NHL in 1970 They were not a good team at first though they won their division in 1975 Andre Boudrias was a star for the team at this time The team made the Stanley Cup finals in 1982 which surprised many people since they had finished below average in the regular season Goaltender Richard Brodeur along with forwards Stan Smyl Thomas Gradin and Darcy Rota led the team Coach Roger Neilson and some players raised white towels on top of their hockey sticks to surrender to the referees who they thought were unfair After that the fans all waved white flags during Canucks playoff games The team lost four games to zero in the finals to the New York Islanders

In the late 1980s players such as Toni Tanti and Petri Skriko led the team They made the finals again in 1994 due to players such as goaltender Kirk MacLean the Russian Rocket Pavel Bure Trevor Linden and Cliff Ronning However they lost the series four games to three to the New York Rangers

The Canucks did poorly in the late 1990s but improved in the 2000s Markus Naslund came second in scoring in 2002 and 2003 and was named the Pearson Trophy winner as players choice for the best player in 2003 Todd Bertuzzi Matthias Ohlund and Ed Jovanovski were also important players who helped lead the team to the division title in 2004 However they lost in overtime of deciding game seven to the Calgary Flames in the first round of the playoffs and the Flames went to the finals

The Canucks just missed the playoffs in 2006 Two of the young stars identical twins Daniel and Henrik Sedin along with players such as Anson Carter were important to the team that year

Behaviour is what an animal or plant does or how it acts Behaviours may be conscious or unconscious They may be inherited or learned

In experiments behaviour is the observed reaction which occurs when an organism is given a stimulus Some organisms are more complicated than others and may be more aware of their surroundings If their behaviour is conscious it means that they know what they are doing If they are not aware of what they are doing this is unconscious behaviour 

Humans will pull their hand back without thinking if they accidentally touch something hot This is done because we inherit nervous system reflexes which cause us to pull away from the thing that is causing the pain

Behaviour is linked to the nervous system as well as the endocrine system The nervous system reacts and notices what happens The hormone system is much slower It makes some kinds of behaviour more or less likely A simple example is the change from being a child to an adult This involves a whole range of hormones which affect growth and behaviour

Behaviour is also linked to learning Organisms which are more complicated can learn better than those that are simpler However even the simplest animals show habituation which is a primitive kind of learning For organisms learning means that they change their behaviour because they remember having been in that situation before and know how to react

People often use the word behaviour to mean the way people interact with one another Children are taught what is good behaviour and what is bad behaviour Good behaviour is about being polite and thoughtful to other people It is the kind of behaviour that people in a society expect from others

In anatomy the ankle is the joint that links the foot to the leg

Tangsudo dangsudo or tang soo do is a Korean martial art It is considered as Korean karate

The name tangsudo means the way of Chinese hands In the Korean peninsula several schools of martial arts had been prohibited by Japanese invaders for 35 years and they went out from secret at the end of the Second World War They were known as schools of tangsudo In the modern Korea the first school of tangsudo was Chungdokwan founded in 1944 by the master WonKukLee As a result of the liberation of Korean nation which was happened 15th August 1945 other four schools were opened Mudokkwan Songmukwan Chidokwan and Changmukwan Other schools were added to the list after the end of the civil war between north and south In December 1955 with the approval of the president of Republic of South Korea Singman Rhee a meeting of the founders of the main schools was called The intention of this meeting was to unify the different schools and to give the name and the form to the national martial art The name should be related neither with China nor with Japan

Among a lot of already postulated names there was Taekwondo proposed by a General named Choi Hong Hee In 1961 the Korean Association of Taesudo rises Mudukkwan of Hwang Kee and Ydokwan of Byong Yun Kwei remained anchored to the tradition The new organization dismembered the technical inheritance of the old tangsudo in 1962 The sporting combat with the use of jumps kicks and fists formed taesudo briefly the techniques of personal defense with the use of levers and throws became hapkido On the other hand the techniques of neikung which control breathing energy and the mental concentration became not very noticeable In 1964 the organization changed its name once again into Korean Association of Taekwondo That name remain ultimate 

In 1966 International Taekwondo Federation is born Its aim was to spread out the new born discipline in the rest of the world Its founder is the Korean general Choi In 1971 Taekwondo becomes national sport of South Korea for presidential decree of the president Park Chung Hee In 1973 World Taekwondo Federation is born presided by Dr Un Yong Kim It was founded in opposition to the ITF The ITF after a series of continual changes will have the support of the North Korea Meanwhile the WTF of Doctor Kim reaches the Olympic Games Seoul 1988 Barcelona 1992 So it is an official Olympic sport and no more martial art The schools which were faithful to tangsudo had to choose the strategy of the emigration by installing them outside of Korea in America Europe Southern Africa etc to maintain live and unaltered the message of the ancient wise men of Orient

Stances 

There are many stances in the tangsudo Some of them are basic for example the stance of preparation the others need more balance such as the stance on one foot or the stance of the crane 

Basic techniques are simple and effective The students learn all the basic techniques which can be found in the traditional art of tangsudo Dojang gives special importance to the art not only to fighting The hand techniques involve amongst others many different fist techniques and knife hand techniques Each of them has a correct form and special practical use and they are used in blocking and in attack The tangsudo is the martial art which gives much attention to foot techniques and to flexibility They are also used for both blocking and attacking 

Training of tangsudo 

In the traditional method the student has to learn the basics first of all later he does repeatedly the fight of one step and the fight of three steps The fight of one step teaches how to direct attention but the fight of three steps teaches him how to move forward and to move backward as well as how to use a distance Together they give the belief in students abilities and the student needs this belief in order to successfully block and attack in the free fight 

The teachers give attention to the importance of the Principles and Creed of Tangsudo the students learn discipline and respect The self confidence the concentration and the control are also underlined because they are important aspects of everyday life 

Practice of basics 

The students do regularly the basic techniques with marching almost during every lesson This helps them to understand the dynamics of a movement and this improves the technique by repetition The basics teach them good balance and good stance 

The forms are the sequences of the basic techniques They are fixed in advance The forms in the tangsudo are obtained from different styles of martial arts Indeed the majority of them is the versions of karate kata They show the special practical use of all the basic techniques in a variety of situations The form is considered as if the performer of the form were defending himself against many enemies The hyong are arranged patterns of techniques which the students do regularly at all levels The study of the forms increases abilities of understanding of learning and of remembering Forms change the shape of the basic techniques and they teach the strategy the tactics the choosing of the right moment and the balance If the tangsudo is treated as the art for the art the forms are easily learned and they are similar to a kind of dance in presentation While the student advances in ability the hyong become more complicated and become the challenge Forms are a part of the training of tangsudo which a student can easily do regularly almost anywhere 

The fight of training gives the chance to use freely all the techniques against one or some opponents Self control is important Proper choosing of the right moment position and methods of passing through the defenses of an opponent are also exercised Although students may use helmets gloves and boots filled with soft material the rule of avoiding any contact is respected 

This exercise lets the person who is being trained practice techniques of self defence against a known attack in a controlled way The aim is the development of responses to certain situation without conscious thought This allows to learn correct distance and choosing of the right moment which are two factors of deciding importance in a real fight This also gives self confidence and control This is a way of practising that is very controlled safe and without contact 

Free fight 

The free fight allows make continuous use of the techniques against the other person in a controlled environment The aim is to defend oneself in an unknown situation Attention is given to safety at all times According to the traditional method the student need not hit a heavy bag to increase the power of his blows and to prepare himself for free fight That is because the students uses of control not contact The students stop their blows close to the target Therefore if in a real fight they decide to hit the target they can do it easily 

According to the traditional theory if the student makes contact constantly it will be difficult to control his actions when he needs But if he always makes continuous use of control he can easily hit when he needs If the student constantly makes contact during free fight his mind will become wild But if the student makes continuous use of controlled fight his mind will become more controlled Both states of mind can spread over his life outside of class Because full contact is not allowed the students have no need to use strong protectors Using boxing gloves and thick feet protectors leads them to hit strongly And when they hit while wearing such things they does not feel whether their technique is correct In order to avoid this problem the traditional masters should make a choice the light protectors of fists and of insteps They suffice to prevent injury when the contact accidentally occurs 

According to the modern method the free fight is similar to fights in kickboxing The students use boxing gloves protectors of the feet and protectors of the head 

Whether free fight is aimed at competition or at fight on the street the student should make a great effort to improve his endurance That is a reason that the student needs to have good basics and good skills of the fight of one step and of three steps they develop the students endurance It will not happen immediately usually two or three months are necessary in order to develop the endurance The important part of it is proper breathing The student has to breathe at the right time when he hits or he blocks If he stops his breath when he does an action he can still do the action but he will become gradually tired as time passes Finally he will lose his ability to continue On the other hand each time he breathes in and breathes out correctly he extends the amount of time when he can continue to fight 

Training of self defence teaches a student how to defend himself against grabs holds and locks It also contains how to deal with situations where it is necessary to defend oneself without causing permanent physical wound to his attacker and how to use pressure points Jayu daeryeon is perfect in order to improve the self defence ability The student can combine any techniques kicks punches blows to feet takedowns and overthrows 

Breaking of the boards is a favorite occupation of many students and spectators Breaking shows the level of the students techniques and it helps them understand what effect their techniques can have on a target It is used during tests of movement to a higher rank and attention is given to safety at all times This occupation teaches to focus the mind and to direct attention correctly towards the technique This also helps the students to pass their barriers of the mind and improves their belief in their abilities

Gasoline n or petrol l is a toxic clear liquid that is mostly used as a fuel in internal combustion engines It is made by boiling petroleum a fossil fuel In a distillation process petroleum is heated to a very high temperature then it separates into its components one of them is gasoline This is an expensive process It is made mostly of octane a hydrocarbon

Gasoline is sold at gas stations In order to burn properly in high compression internal combustion engines each brand of gasoline includes gasoline additives So the exact make up of gasoline is different at different stations Gasoline is graded by its octane rating that measures how well it will burn Most car engines can burn regular gasoline which has an octane rating of 87 Precision made engines require or prefer premium gasoline with an octane rating of 93 Most stations offer three different mixtures of gasoline with three separate octane ratings and prices

Gasoline is most often used in vehicles like cars vans etc Gasoline can be used in a wide variety of other things that we use every day such as lawnmowers leaf blowers and small boat motors Some larger vehicles like trucks or ships may use diesel fuel instead of gasoline 

Gasoline is very dangerous It can explode when an electric spark lights it It is also harmful if a human drinks it It hurts the environment and human health by creating poisonous gases such as carbon monoxide If a gasoline engine is used indoors or in a closed space the carbon monoxide can cause death in minutes Many people die every year from using gasoline powered generators indoors

The US accounts for about 44 of the worlds gasoline consumption In 2003 The US consumed convert476474GLUSgal impgal which equates to 13 gigalitres of gasoline each day The US used about 510 billion litres of gasoline in 2006 of which 56 was mid grade and 95 was premium grade

Western countries have among the highest usage rates per personCitation neededdateSeptember 2010

Unlike the US countries in Europe impose a substantial taxes on fuels such as gasoline For example price for gasoline in Europe is more than twice that in the US

Because of the low fuel taxes the retail price of gasoline in the US is subject to greater changes when calculated as a percentage of cost per unit  From 1998 to 2004 the price of gasoline was between 1 and 2 USD per US gallon After 2004 the price increased until the average gas price reached a high of 411 per US gallon in mid 2008 then dropped approximately 260 per US gallon as of September 2009 Recently the US has experienced an upswing in gas prices of 1351 from Jan 31st to March 7 2011

Most consumer goods have posted prices that exclude tax taxes are added based on a percentage of the purchase price Because of primitive gasoline pumps in the 1920s United States gasoline prices are posted with taxes included and the taxes are set on cents per gallon Taxes are added by federal state and local governments As of 2009 the federal tax is 184 per gallon for gasoline and 244 per gallon for diesel Among states the highest gasoline tax rates as of January 2011 are California New York Hawaii and Connecticut The federal government and many states fail to increase their gasoline taxes over time with inflation However some states also charge a sales tax as a percentage and vary in amount depending on the cost of the gasoline

About 9 of all gasoline sold in the US in May 2009 was premium grade according to the Energy Information Administration Some car manufacturers recommend premium gasoline but have computer controlled engines that adjust the timing to avoid knocking So most cars can burn regular grade gasoline but at a slightly reduced performance The Associated Press said premium gaswhich is a higher octane and costs several cents a gallon more than regular unleadedshould be used only if the manufacturer says it is required

To reduce the use of imported oil the US uses Gasohol and E85 ethanolgasoline mixtures

Brazil has the largest national fuel ethanol industry Gasoline sold in Brazil contains at least 25 anhydrous ethanol Hydrous ethanol can be used as fuel in more than 90 of new cars sold in the country Brazilian ethanol is produced from sugar cane and noted for high carbon sequestration

Tropical cyclone or hurricane is a circular air movement over the warm ocean waters in the warm part of Earth near the equator Most tropical cyclones create strong winds and heavy rains While some tropical cyclones stay out in the sea others pass over land which can be dangerous because they can cause a lot of damage 

Tropical cyclones form in the warm parts of the earth when moist hot air rises It begins as a group of storm winds when the water gets as hot as 80 degrees or hotter The Coriolis effect causes the winds to spiral 

Tropical cyclones form in the northern Atlantic northern Pacific southwestern Pacific and Indian Ocean Tropical cyclones rarely form elsewhere in the world

Tropical cyclones are usually given names because it helps in forecasting tracking and reporting They are named once they have steady winds of 62 kmh Committees of the World Meteorological Organization pick names Once named a cyclone is usually not renamed

When tropical cyclones make landfall they may create some damage Tropical cyclones are also known to kill people and destroy cities In the last 200 years about 15 million people have been killed by tropical cyclones

Wind damages can account up to 83 of the total damages caused when broken wreckage pieces from destroyed objects can become deadly flying pieces Flooding can also occur when rainfalls andor storm surges pour water onto land

There is a possibility of indirect deaths after a tropical cyclone makes landfall For example New Orleans Louisiana suffered from poor sanitary conditions after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005

Tropical cyclones are classified into different categories depending on their strength and location The National Hurricane Center which observes hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Eastern and Central Pacific Ocean classify them into the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale

Tropical cylones in other places such as the Western Pacific Ocean or the Southern Hemisphere are classified on similar scales For example if a tropical storm in the western Pacific reaches hurricane strength winds it is then officially recognized as a typhoon

A tropical depression is an organized group of clouds and thunderstorms with a clear surface circulation and maximum sustained winds of less than 17 ms It has no eye and does not usually have the spiral shape of more powerful storms Only the Philippines are known to name tropical depressions

A tropical storm is an organized system of strong thunderstorms with a very clear surface circulation and maximum sustained winds between 17 and 32 ms At this point the cyclonic shape starts to form although an eye does not usually appear in tropical storms Most tropical cyclone agencies beginning naming cyclonic storms at this point except for the Philippines which have their own way of naming cyclones

A hurricane or typhoon is a cyclonic weather system with sustained winds of at least 33 ms A tropical cyclone of this strength usually develop an eye an area of calm conditions at the center of circulation The eye is often seen from space as a small round cloud free spot Surrounding the eye is the eyewall an area in which the strongest thunderstorms and winds spin around the storms center The fastest sustained windspeed founded in tropical cyclones is thought to be 85 ms

Fat is something found in foods and it is the most concentrated kind of energy that a human can use It has 9 kilocalories in one gram The other two types of energy that humans can use are carbohydrates and proteins Those each have 4 kilocalories in one gram The human body uses the fat to make the body bigger The human eats healthy things like vegetables to nullify or reverse the effects of fat

Fats can be solid or fluid at room temperature For example cooking oil is a type of fluid fat Butter is a solid fat Some fats come from animals others come from plants Fat from plants is called vegetable fat Examples of vegetable fats are margarine and vegetable oil Examples of animal fats are butter cream and lard 

The different types of fats are saturated unsaturated and trans fats Trans fats are created in the food industry by treating other types of fats and giving them a different structure This happens when oil is hardened to make margarine for example Many restaurants also use trans fats for deep frying food Trans fats are the most unhealthy fats to eat and can cause heart disease

Fats are usually not soluble in water but they can be dissolved in other organic solvents Fats are triesters of fatty acids and glycerol 

Fat is important for the human body because it gives much energy and helps the body use the vitamins in the food It is also good for the skin and hair Olive oil is an especially healthy fat Many types of fish also contain healthy fat for example salmon sardines herring and tuna But if too much fat collects in the body a person can become too heavy The energy that fat gives the body must be used up by moving or working Some vegetables like celery or carrots contribute much less to the bodies fat supply Though being very important for the human body it can be harmful in large amounts

Saturated fat is a kind of fat It contains no double bonds It contains carbon atoms that are fully saturated with hydrogen

Saturated fats are a kind of fat Saturated fats are bad for people They can raise cholesterol in the heart and may give people a heart attack if they have too much saturated fat

The Mackinac Bridge is a 5 mile long bridge that carries a four lane interstate highway Interstate 75 It was built by the US state of Michigan and connects that states Upper Peninsula and Lower Peninsula together

The Mackinac Bridge passes over a strait of water that connects two Great Lakes Lake Michigan and Lake Huron 

At the center of the Mackinac Bridge is a long suspension span in which the bridge made of steel and concrete hangs from wires that run down from two huge curved cables

The government agency that runs the Mackinac Bridge charges motor vehicles a toll to drive over it In 2007 the toll was 250 for a passenger car

The government hangs colored lights from the big cable and turns them on at night so that the bridge can be seen from many miles away

The Mackinac Bridge was opened in 1957 and this started a major economic boom in northern Michigan as tourists drove from all over North America to see the bridge the Great Lakes and the northern forests

Unsaturated fat is a kind of fat It is different from saturated fat in that it is liquid at room temperature while saturated fat is more solid Its molecules contains double bonds whose carbon atoms that are not fully saturated with hydrogen There are two types 

In cellular metabolism an unsaturated fat molecule contains somewhat less energy than the saturated fat molecule of the same length

Examples of unsaturated fats are palmitoleic acid oleic acid myristoleic acid linoleic acid and arachidonic acid Foods containing unsaturated fats include avocado nuts and vegetable oils such as canola and olive oils Meat products contain both saturated and unsaturated fats

Unsaturated fat is better for people than saturated fat Some testing has shown that it can raise a persons HDL levels Unsaturated fat is also very important for a healthy brain

People think that unsaturated fats are healthier than saturated fats The United States Food and Drug Administration recommended that the amount of unsaturated fat consumed should not exceed 30 of ones daily caloric intake The new dietary guidelines have eliminated this recommendation at the request of the meat and dairy industries

Most foods contain both unsaturated and saturated fats Food packages promote only one or the other depending on which is the largest share in the product So various unsaturated fat vegetable oils such as olive oils also contain saturated fat

Cold fusion is nuclear fusion at room temperature and normal pressure Nuclear fusion is the process by which many nuclei the center of an atom containing protons and neutrons are forced to join together to form a heavier nucleus and during that process energy is released Some scientists hope that this may be Earths future energy source but most scientists do not agree

For nuclear fusion to take place a large amount of energy is needed With this energy the atoms are pushed together which are repelled by the electrostatic force But once this force is overcome and the nuclei are pushed close enough together another much more powerful force will take over the strong nuclear force It only operates at short distances so when the nuclei are close enough they attract each other because of the strong nuclear force which is stronger than the electrostatic force It is hoped that the energy released by cold fusion is much greater than the energy used to push the atoms together 

In 1989 two scientists Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann published a paper in Nature an important science journal claiming to have created cold fusion This was a very important story at the time Other scientists were not able to repeat their experiments and this is why cold fusion is not generally accepted by scientists at the moment Several dozen scientists are still working on cold fusion still and they publish in peer reviewed journals and other academic sources regularly but most are not convinced

Cusco was the capital of Tahuantinsuyu The city was planned to be shaped like a puma The city had two areas the hurin and hanan which were further divided to each be part of two of the four provinces of the Inca Empire Chinchasuyu Antisuyu Cuntisuyu and Collasuyu 

A road led from each of these quarters to the corresponding quarter of the empire Each local leader was required to build a house in the city and live part of the year in Cusco but only in the quarter of Cusco that corresponded to the quarter of the empire he had territory in 

According to Inca legend the city was built by Sapa Inca Pachacuti the man who transformed the Kingdom of Cusco from a sleepy city state into the vast empire of Tahuantinsuyu But archaeological evidence points to a slower more organic growth of the city beginning before Pachacutieven though he did initiate growth in the city after defeating the Chancas as a monument to Incan glory There was however a city plan and two rivers were channeled around the city

The first Spanish soldiers arrived in the city on November 15 1533 Spanish conquistador or conqueror Francisco Pizarro however officially refounded Cusco on March 23 1534 naming it the Very noble and great city of Cusco The many buildings constructed after the Spanish conquest have Spanish influence with a mix of Inca architecture The Spanish made a new city on the foundations of the old Inca city replacing Incan temples with churches and palaces for the Spanish In the colony the city of Cusco was very rich thanks to the agriculture cattle raising mining and trade with Spain Many churches and convents were built and even a Cathedral and the Universidad Nacional San Antonio Abad del Cusco

The major earthquake that hit Cusco in 1950 badly destroyed the Dominican Priory and Church of Santo Domingo which were built on top of the impressive Koricancha The citys Inca architecture however survived the earthquake Many of the old Inca walls were thought to have been lost after the earthquake but the granite walls of the Koricancha were exposed as well as many walls throughout the city While some wanted to restore the buildings to their colonial splendor some of Cusco citizens urged city officials to retain the exposed walls Eventually they won out and now tourists from around the world enjoy looking at these ruins within the living city The 1950 earthquake was the second time that the Dominican Priory had been destroyed the first being in 1650 when another major earthquake struck Cusco

Other nearby Inca sites are Pachacutis presumed winter home Machu Picchu which can be reached by a lightly maintained Inca trail the fortress at Ollantaytambo and the fortress of Sacsayhuaman which is approximately two kilometers from Cusco Other less visited ruins include Inca Wasi the highest of all Inca sites at 3980 m and Old Vilcabamba the capital of the Inca after the Spanish took over Cusco

The surrounding area located in the Huatanay Valley is strong in agriculture There is corn barley quinoa tea and coffee grown

Cuscos main stadium Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega attracted many tourists during South Americas continental soccer championship the Copa Amrica 2004 which was held in Peru

Cusco is a region in Peru The capital is the city of Cusco

Cusco Region is home to Machu Picchu one of the most famous landmarks in South America

Joe Buck was an orphan who was raised by his grandmother in Texas Sally died after Joe grew up when he was drafted into the US Army He had a girlfriend who was called Crazy Annie but she had been sent to a psychiatric hospital With both women gone from his life Joe had no family or close friends After he left the Army he worked as a dishwasher and dreamed of moving to New York City to become a hustler a male prostitute He saved money to make the trip bought some stylish cowboy clothes and traveled to New York on a bus

Joe knew little about the realities of both New York and his chosen job and he soon found himself homeless with no money and only rare chances to earn any When he first met Ratso Rizzo Ratso broken wikt linkswindleswindled Joe out of 20 but when they met again Ratso offered to share his place which turned out to be a room in a condemned building The two became partners Ratso shared what he knew about New York with Joe and became his manager and Joe shared any money he got with Ratso Ratso was sick probably with tuberculosis and as time went on he depended more and more on Joe Ratso cheered both of them up with stories about his plans to move to Florida before winter came

The weather turned cold as the year ended but Joe and Ratso got a break when they were invited to a big party Along with eating as much of the food there as they could Joe met a broken wikt linksocialitesocialite who finally treated him the way hed always wanted to be in New York City and paid him likewise Ratso however became even more ill and was unable to walk or stand for long He refused to go to a doctor or a hospital and insisted Joe take him to Florida

Joe tried to set up another encounter with the socialite to raise travel money but failed He donated blood to get grocery money and by chance met a traveling broken wikt linksalespersonsalesman The salesman invited Joe to spend the night with him but later felt guilty and sent Joe home with a St Christopher medal When Joe found Ratso sicker than ever he returned to beat and rob the salesman for the money they needed

Joe and Ratso left for Florida on a bus headed to Miami Joe bought new clothes for them both and threw away his cowboy clothing I aint no kinda hustler Joe decided and he planned to find a regular job once they reached Florida Joe and Ratso talked and joked during most of the trip but Ratso died before they arrived Joe realized how much he had cared about Ratso as a person and that what hed missed most in his life was someone to be close with Joe had lost his grandmother and his sweetheart Now hed lost his best friend and Joe was scared to go on alone

If two people want to have sex there are laws nthat say that they must be a certain age This is called the age of consent At that age law says that the people are mature enough to decide for themselves if they want to have sex with each other

The age of consent varies between states and countries The laws in different areas range as low as 9 yrs old to 21 yrs or older The laws are almost always affected by a nations culture Nations with Islamic law tend to have lower ages European countries often range from 14yrs to 16yrs In the United States the age varies from 16 to 18 In many areas there is a close in age part of the laws This allows for people under of consent but above a certain age to have sex with people as long as there older partner is either less than a certain age or the difference in age is a certain amount of years The age of consent may also vary if one of the people is in a possition of authority over the other For example if the older person was a teacher member of the clergy or the police the age may be higher than for other people There may also be a minimum age where consent is possible Some areas do not think it is a crime if the older person believed that the younger person was of legal age while in other areas this is not allowed If the two people are married the age is often much lower Age of consent can also be affected by the type of sex or the sex of the person Many areas have different ages for Homosexual sex as well as Anal sex and other forms of sodomy There are areas which also have different ages depending on if the person is male or female

Franz Kafka was a famous Czech born German speaking writer His best known works are The Metamorphosis and the novels The Trial and The Castle Not much of his work was published during his lifetime He asked his friend to make sure that all his writings which were not published including his three novels would be destroyed when he died Fortunately his friend did not destroy them and they were published after Kafkas death

Kafkas writings are about the frightening world around him which he often did not understand A typical situation in his books might be someone who has gone somewhere to take a message but he does not know what the message is or who it is for The people he meets confuse him even more Sometimes when people find themselves in strange nightmarish situations like this they are described as Kafkaesque situations

Hi Howwi alles Fit Wir wollen dich nur rgern 9 Kafka was born into a middle class Jewish family His father was a merchant He was very strict and unkind to his family Kafkas stories often have fathers who are very brutal and unkind Kafka spent most of his life living at home He never married or became free from his parents He felt that he had no will of his own He wrote about people who are dominated by some mysterious power He found it difficult to make friends he hated his job and everyone around him He often felt that he belonged nowhere He was German speaking but lived in a Czech speaking country He was different because he was Jewish but he did not become part of the Jewish community either He said that he was a socialist and an atheist but although he was interested in politics he never took part in political activity He supported Czechs who wanted to rule their own country and let their culture flourish but he was not one of them because he himself was brought up in a German culture

It was while he was studying law at the University of Prague that he met Max Brod who was to become his friend Brod was a writer himself and he later wrote a biography of Kafka

After his studies Kafka took a job in an insurance company He was good at his job although he hated it He found the office work boring and he spent his nights writing In 1917 he got tuberculosis Gradually he became more and more ill He had to retire in 1922 He spent some time in a sanitorium He died in 1924

Several publishers realized how good Kafkas writings were and asked him whether they could publish his works Kafka reluctantly let a few things be published One of these works was a story called Metamorphosis It is about a man called Gregor Samsa Gregor wakes up one morning to find he has changed into a horrible bug His family becomes ashamed of him and they stop looking after him so that he slowly dies Stories like these are a kind of fable They are full of strange and frightening situations

His novel Amerika published in 1927 is about a man who arrives in America looking for a father figure to protect him He is quiet and timid and other people use him In the end he dies 

In The Trial a man who works in a bank is arrested and taken to court He is never told what he has done wrong Even the priest tells him that if he asks what he has done wrong it proves that he is guilty Finally he is executed

In The Castle a man who is simply called K arrives at a castle saying that he has been given a job there but the people there say they have not been told about his appointment Kafka never finished the novel but Max Brod says that Kafka was going to end it with K receiving permission to stay at the castle just as he was dying The German word Schloss has two meanings castle and lock K becomes locked in this strange situation

At the time of his death only a few people understood Kafkas writings We are lucky that Max Brod saved all the unpublished books which would otherwise have been lost Kafka is now thought of as one of the most important writers of the 20th century His works had a lot of influence on German literature

Ayyavazhi is a religion with one god that started in South India in the middle of the 19th century The zhi in the word Ayyavazhi is a retroflex ri

Ayyavazhi is not a part of Hinduism but since it was not considered a separate religion it was considered as a branch of Hinduism only officially It has evolved into a different religion spreading fast in Tamil Nadus southern districts of Kanyakumari Tirunelveli and Tuticorin As one of the fastest growing religions of southern India its speed growth had been noted in the Christian missionary reports of the mid 19th century

The ideas and philosophy of the religion are based on the teachings of Ayya Vaikundar and the religious texts Akilattirattu Ammanai and Arul Nool

Ayyavazhi began to be seen firstly by the large number of people gathering to worship Ayya Vaikundar at Swamithoppe which is at that time poovandanthoppe The majority of the followers of Ayyavazhi were from the poor group of the society For the Christian missionaries it gives a big challenge in their converting mission from its beginning Although the majority of these followers were from the Chanar cast apart from Ayyavazhi sources some outer sources too says that a large number of people from other castes also followed this religion 

By the middle of nineteenth century Ayyavazhi had come to be recognised as a separate religion grown well in the region of South Travancore and South Tirunelveli The growth in its number of followers had increased speedly from 1840s After the death of Vaikundar the religion was spread on the basis of his teachings and the religious books Akilattirattu Ammanai and Arul Nool The five Citars who were the deciples of Ayya Vaikundar and their descendants travelled to several parts of the country and carried the mission of Ayyavazhi At that time the Payyan dynasty started ruling of Swamithoppe pathi while other Pathis came under the control of the followers of Ayya Hundreds of Nizhal Thangals were built across the country Currently Bala Prajapathi Adikalar one of descendant of Payyan dynasty is said to be as the leader of Ayyavazhi He has laid foundations for a large number of Nizhal Thangals all over South India And now seeing the growth of the religion the day of birth of Vaikundar Ayya Vaikunda Avataram was announced as a holiday by the government for the districts of Tirunelveli and Tuticorin from this year while the district of Kanyakumari was announced as a holiday earlier

The holy books of Ayyavazhi are the Akilattirattu Ammanai and the Arul Nool and they are the source of the religions mythology The holy book states that the Akilattirattu Ammanai was written down by Hari Gopalan Citar by hearing the contents of Akilam told by Narayana to his wife Lakshmi There was no definite history about the beginning of Arul Nool but the followers believe that it was written by Citars and by those who get possessed by divine power It contains the prayers hymns and ways for the worship in Ayyavazhi religious practices prophesies and also many rules 

To the Ayyavazhi devotees there are five holy places called Pathis with Panchappathis as the most important The temple of Swamithoppepathi is the head of the Ayyavazhi religion The Vakaippathi where 700 families were sent to Thuvayal Thavasu by Vaikundar was approved as a Pathi in Akilam although this place has no direct association with the activities of Vaikundar There is a big disagreement within the followers of Ayyavazhi as to the holiness of some of the places of worship The Avatharappathi in Thiruchendur was accepted by the book Akilam as a Pathi but as some of the followers believe that the place at which the present temple is located is not the exact place where Ayya Vaikundar incarnated from the sea they disagree with the other devotees There are also some followers which strongly quarrel Thiruchendur as a Pathi though they accept it as a secondary holy site The list of Pathis announced by the headquarters of Ayyavazhi does not add Avatharappathi

Akilathirattu Ammanai  also called Thiru Edu is the main religious book of the Southern Indian Ayyavazhi officially a branch of Hinduism The title is shortened as Akilam This is the largest Ammanai work

According to the book Hari Gopalan Citar wrote this book on the twenty seventh day of the Tamil month of Karthikai in the year 1016 ME The author says that God woke him up during his sleep and ordered him to take the first words from what he said Akilathirattu was recorded on palm leaves Then in 1939 it was given printed form

According to the author the book is the story of God coming in this age the Kali Yukam or Iron Age to rule the world by transforming it into that of Dharma Yukam This story of faith has woven together the historical facts about Ayya Vaikundar and his activities with mixing of episodes from the Hindu Puranas and Itihasas It is presented as if Vishnu is telling the whole story to his consort Lakshmi

Though the Citar Hari Gopalan wrote the book Akilam as per him he did not know any thing about the contents of the book He woke up in the morning as usual and he did not know what he had written the day before

Ayya Vaikundar  is a Manu avatar of the Lord Narayana according to Akilattirattu Ammanai the holy book of the Ayyavazhi religion officially a Tamil Hindu branch 

The physical human body of Ayya Vaikundar was born with the name Muthukutty However Muthukutty is referred to as Sampooranathevan a deva in the religious book Akilam Ayya Vikundar is a combination of the spirit of Narayana the soul of the Supreme God Ekam and the body of an ordinary human being

The Ekam as soul incarnated with the spirit of Narayana in the body of Muthukutty

Many ducks are migratory This means that they spend the summer months in a different place than the winter months Ducks show a cosmopolitan distribution they can be found all over the world except for Antarctica Some duck species live on the South Georgia and Auckland Islands which are subantarctic Many species have established themselves on remote islands such as Kerguelen or Hawaii 

Some ducks are bred and kept by humans They are not wild ducks They are kept to provide food or to use their feathers for pillows and other items in the house Especially in Asia many people like to eat duck

The Boeing 737 is a medium sized short to medium range commercial airliner built by the North American company Boeing This plane is so far the best selling jet airliner on Earth There are nearly 6000 examples to be found around the world with over 1200 of them in the air at any given time The 737s seats are usually arranged with 3 on one side and 3 on the other side

The airplane was officially announced in 1964 The plane had already got many airlines interested even before it first flew in 1967 German airline Lufthansa made the first passenger flight in 1969

The initial model was the 737 100 It was launched by Lufthansa in 1965 The 100 was rolled out on January 17 1967 and entered service in 1968 The aircraft is the smallest variant of the 737 Only 30 737 100s were ordered and delivered and no 737 100s remain in service today The original Boeing prototype last operated by NASA retired more than 30 years after its maiden flight and is on exhibit in the Museum of Flight in Seattle

The new 737 Classic series featured CFM56 turbofan engines which had a better fuel economy and far less noise However it also posed an engineering challenge given the low ground clearance of the 737 Boeing and engine supplier CFM International solved the problem by placing the engine ahead of the wing They also moved engine accessories to the sides of the engine pod giving the 737 a distinctive non circular air intake The wing incorporated a number of changes for improved aerodynamics

The 737 300 was launched in 1981 by both USAir and Southwest Airlines becoming the first model of the 737 Classic series The aircraft has a typical capacity of 128 passengers in a two class configuration The 300 series remained in production until 1999 when the last aircraft was delivered to Air New Zealand on December 17 1999

Various modifications have been made to aircraft previously in service The 737 300 can be retrofitted with Aviation Partners Boeing winglets The 737 300 retrofitted with winglets is designated the 300SP Used passenger 300 aircraft have also been converted to freighter versions

The 737 500 was launched in 1987 by Southwest Airlines and entered service in 1990 The fuselage length of the 737 500 is similar to the 737 200 while incorporating the improvements of the 737 Classic series It offered a modern and direct replacement of the 737 200 while also allowing longer routes with fewer passengers to be more economical than with the 737 300 The last 500 was delivered to All Nippon Airlines on July 26 1999

By the early 1990s it became clear that the new Airbus A320 was a serious threat to Boeings market share Airbus won previously loyal 737 customers such as Lufthansa and United Airlines In November 1993 Boeings board of directors authorized the Next Generation program to replace the 737 Classic series The 600 700 and 800 series were planned After engineering trade studies and discussions with major 737 customers Boeing proceeded to launch the 737 Next Generation series

New features included

The 737 600 replaced the 737 500 in Boeings line up and was also intended to replace airlines DC 9s The 737 600 was launched by Scandinavian Airlines System in 1995 with the first aircraft delivered on September 18 1998 The 600 is the only Boeing 737 still in production that does not include winglets as an option WestJet was to be the Boeing launch customer for the 737 600 with winglets but announced in their Q2 2006 results that they were not going to move ahead with those plans The 737 600 competes with the Airbus A318 and Embraer 195 A total of 69 600s have been delivered with no unfilled orders as of 2009

The 737 700 was the first of Next Generation series when launch customer Southwest Airlines ordered the variant in November 1993 The variant was based on the 737 300 and entered service in 1998 It replaced the 737 300 in Boeings lineup and its direct competitor is the A319 It typically seats 132 passengers in a two class cabin or 149 in all economy configuration

The 737 800 is a stretched version of the 737 700 and replaces the 737 400 It also filled the gap left by Boeings discontinuation of the McDonnell Douglas MD 80 and MD 90 after Boeings merger with McDonnell Douglas The 800 was launched by Hapag Lloyd Flug in 1994 and entered service in 1998 The 737 800 seats 162 passengers in a two class layout or 189 in one class and competes with the A320 For many airlines in the US the 737 800 replaced aging Boeing 727 200 trijets and MD 80s and MD 90s

Boeing later introduced the 737 900 the longest and most powerful variant to date Alaska Airlines launched the 737 900 in 1997 and accepted delivery on May 15 2001 Because the 900 retains the same exit configuration of the 800 seating capacity is limited to 177 seats in two classes or 189 in a single class layout The 737 900 also retains the MTOW and fuel capacity of the 800 trading range for payload These shortcomings until recently prevented the 737 900 from effectively competing with the Airbus A321 The 737 900ER which was called the 737 900X prior to launch is the newest addition and the largest variant of the Boeing 737 line and was introduced to meet the range and passenger capacity of the discontinued 757 200 and to directly compete with the Airbus A321 An additional pair of exit doors and a flat rear pressure bulkhead increase seating capacity to 180 passengers in a 2 class configuration or 215 passengers in a single class layout Additional fuel capacity and standard winglets improve range to that of other 737NG variants The first 737 900ER was rolled out of the Renton Washington factory on August 8 2006 for its launch customer Lion Air Lion Air received this aircraft on April 27 2007 in a special dual paint scheme combining the Lion Air lion on the vertical stabilizer and the Boeing livery colors on the fuselage The 737 900ER is now the standard 737 900 model offered by Boeing The 737 900 non ER model has been discontinued in favor of the 900ER but the standard 900 remains in service as of January 2010

In late August 2011 Boeing announced the 737 MAX to replace the Next Generation in response to Airbus A320NEO

Here is a list of different types of 737

Tsar is a name for the ruler of Bulgaria in 9131422 later usage in 19081946 and the emperor of Russia from 1546 until 1721 Since 1721 the title of Russian emperors was imperator but the word tsar remained in common use until the Russian Revolution 1917 It is also spelled Tzar Czar and Csar and is the Eastern European word for Caesar

The last Tsar to Rule Russia was Tsar Nicholas II

Engelbert Dollfuss was the Chancellor of Austria from 1932 until 1933 He led the country as a dictator from early 1933 until 1934

He studied law in Vienna and Economics in Berlin During World War I he served in the Alps and briefly became a Prisoner of War in 1918 

He became Chancellor on May 20 1932 as head of a right wing coalition government He wanted to solve the problems caused by the Depression He had problems finding majorities in parliament The measures he liked to take to deal with inflation were not well liked In March 1933 he suspended the Austrian parliament He then governed by decree 

With Adolf Hitler as Chancellor in Germany Dollfuss feared that the influence of the NSDAP would grow This would then lead to a growth in popularity for its Austrian counterpart Because of this he banned the NSDAP in June 1933 He also banned the SDAP in February 1934 

In September 1933 he formed an umbrella grouping to support the regime the Vaterlndische Front and merged the Christian Social Party with the para military Heimwehr a Nationalist paramilitary group The regime which was put intp power by him and remained in power until 1938 is often called Austrofascism The form of state he employed was called the Stndestaat

On July 25 1934 eight Austrian Nazis entered the Chancellery building and shot and killed Dollfuss in an attempted coup as a prelude to Anschluss The Nazis surrendered and were executed Kurt Schuschnigg became the new dictator of Austria

A language isolate is a language that does not have another language related to it

Many languages are related to other languages because they both come from an older language and are similar to other languages These groups that are similar are called language families Most languages belong to a language family but some are not related to other languages These languages are called language isolates

In taxonomy a species is a kind of animal or plant All animals or plants that are the same kind belong to the same species Wolves are one species Humans are another species Broadly the idea is that cats breed with cats and produce more cats This is the basis for deciding to have a species named Felis catus However giving a simple definition of species is rather difficult and many people have tried

Species is a word for a special kind of living thing like a crow Crows and ravens are similar but not the same so they are together in a more general group called a genus Then there is a family and then an order such as the songbirds The next group is the class all birds are in the same class After that is the phylum such as vertebrates which is all animals with backbones Last of all is the kingdom like the animal kingdom These are ways to classify living things 

There is a mnemonic to help people remember the order of the divisions which are listed again below King Phillip Came Over For Great Spaghetti

Take as an example the bird called a Common Loon or Great Northern Diver

An ancestor is a parent a parents parent a parents parents parent and so on It is usually used to mean a creator of a generation which lives on

River dolphins are four species of dolphin which live in fresh water rivers and estuaries Three species live in fresh water rivers The fourth species the La Plata Dolphin lives in salt water estuaries and the ocean

The following is the taxonomy of river dolphins or how dolphins are classified

An estuary is a place near the ocean where saltwater mixes with freshwater An estuary is often found where a river flows into an ocean The river suddenly becomes wider and wider and flows slowly to the sea

Estuaries come in all sizes and shapes each according to its location and climate They are found mostly where rivers meet the sea and fresh water mixes with salt water Bays marshes swamps and inlets are all examples of estuaries A view of an estuary from the air is usually an interesting sight rivers curve and bend to find their way back to the sea Estuaries are usually filled with shallow waters and sunlight reaches all levels of the water Marsh grasses algae and oher kinds of plants live in estuaries and provide food for a variety of fish crabs oysters and shrimp

Some estuaries are very large They may be large ocean bays that have more than one river flowing into them For example Chesapeake Bay is a very large estuary and several different rivers meet the Atlantic Ocean there 

Estuaries are especially important since they play the role of nurseries for many different types of young fish and other animals before they head out toward the open ocean Many sea birds also nest in estuaries

The United States government has a program to study and protect the natural environment in many different estuaries called the National Estuarine Research Reserve System One reason that the natural environment in so many estuaries is in danger is because they are also good places for people to live and build cities Unfortunately many of worlds largest cities are located at estuaries

James Bond is a fictional British spy created by Ian Fleming in 1953

In 1953 Fleming wrote Casino Royale the very first James Bond novel The novel made a lot of money and he continued to write one James Bond novel each year until he died in 1963 In 1962 Albert R Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman started to produce the first James Bond movie Dr No starring Sean Connery as James Bond The movie became extremely popular and they continued to make more Bond movies In the end of the 1960s Connery did not want to do any more Bond movies and many thought that Bond was now dead In 1969 George Lazenby appeared in one movie as the Bond character but the movie was not successful

In the 1970s producers came up with the Live and Let Die movie starring Roger Moore as Bond The movie became a very big success The series continued throughout the 1970s and 1980s with Roger Moore playing the role of Bond

In the 1980s Bond movies were not as successful at the box office Unlike the 1960s and 1970s in the 1980s there were many other action movies being produced that could compete with the Bond series 

After Moore left the role as Bond he was replaced with Timothy Dalton in the late 1980s Dalton tried to make a serious down to earth Bond closer to the Fleming novels Fans did not like Daltons interpretation of the Bond character and the movies made little money

The Cold War ended in 1991 Since Bond almost always fought Communists many now thought that the Bond series of movies was finally dead

In 1995 producers developed the Goldeneye movie starring Pierce Brosnan as Bond This film made the Bond character well known in the 1990s Brosnan appeared in several Bond movies

In 2002 the James Bond character was used in the 20th movie Die Another Day the 40th anniversary of the movies and the 50th anniversary since Fleming wrote his first Bond novel In 2006 the 21st movie Casino Royale was released Pierce Brosnan who played James Bond in the previous four moviess was replaced by Daniel Craig the first James Bond to have blonde hair The movie is based on the first Ian Fleming novel of the same name but is set in the present day The movie features a cameo appearance by Richard Branson a British billionaire It has a new model of Aston Martin DB9 the car that made James Bond so famous in the 1960s Many fans think that whilst this movie is different to other movies it is much better and movies in the future will be in this new format In 2008 Craig appeared in a second Bond movie Quantum of Solace

A Streetcar Named Desire is a 1947 play by Tennessee Williams A 1951 movie based on it starred Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh

A tetrahedron is a three dimensional shape It has four corners It looks like a pyramid It has six equally long edges four corners and four equilateral triangular faces Every two edges meet on one of those corners forming a sixty degree angle

Robert Hooke FRS was an English naturalist architect and polymath Hooke played an important role in the birth of science in the 17th century with both experimental and theoretical work He was a colleague of Robert Boyle and Christopher Wren and a rival to Isaac Newton Hooke was a leader in the plans to rebuild after the Great Fire of London in 1666

There is no surviving portrait of Hooke

He discovered Hookes Law of elasticity He designed and ordered the making of telescopes and microscopes and used both instruments He reported on this work in a book called Micrographica in 1665 He was the first person to see biological cells He made drawings of bodies in the Solar System and made the first attempts to measure the distance of certain stars

Robert Hooke was appointed the Royal Societys first Curator of Experiments in 1662 and he rose to be Secretary of the Royal Society He took responsibility for experiments performed at its weekly meetings This was a position he held for over 40 years

In 1664 Hooke also was appointed Professor of Geometry at Gresham College in London and Cutlerian Lecturer in Mechanics

On 8 July 1680 Hooke observed the nodal patterns associated with the mode of vibration of glass plates He ran a bow along the edge of a glass plate covered with flour and saw the nodal patterns emergep101

Hooke did some fundamental work on gravitation and the motion of the planets Forever after he was convinced that Newton and the world had cheated him of the creditp389

He was also known for his work in natural history He reported on his microsope use in a book called Micrographica in 1665 He was the first person to see biological cells and was the first to use the word cell to describe them

In 1668 in a talk to the Royal Society he recognised that fossil shells of unknown marine animals suggested that some species had become extinct

Hooke achieved fame in his day as Surveyor to the City of London and chief assistant of Christopher Wren Hooke helped Wren rebuild London after the Great Fire in 1666 

He also worked on the Royal Greenwich Observatory and the infamous Bethlem Royal Hospital Many other buildings were designed by Hooke including the Royal College of Physicians 

Hookes collaboration with Christopher Wren included St Pauls Cathedral whose dome uses a method of construction conceived by Hooke Hooke also participated in the design of the Pepys Library which held the manuscripts of Samuel Pepyss diaries the most frequently cited eyewitness account of the Great Fire of London

In the reconstruction after the Great Fire Hooke proposed redesigning Londons streets on a grid pattern with wide boulevards and arteries a pattern later used in the renovation of Paris Liverpool and many American cities This proposal was thwarted by arguments over property rights as property owners were surreptitiously shifting their boundaries Hooke was in demand to settle many of these disputes due to his skill as a surveyor and his tact as an arbitrator

Emission is a word that originally comes from Latin Originally it means something that is sent out Several things can be sent out

Count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy was a Russian novelist and anarchist famous for writing the books War and Peace and Anna Karenina

Tolstoy was born at Yasnaya Polyana the family estate in the region of Tula Russia and he married Sofia Andreevna Bers 

He was a Christian and believed in non violence His work The Kingdom of God is Within You has influenced people like Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King He died of pneumonia at Astapovo station in 1910 at the age of 82

People have made wine in the American state of California for a long time California has become recognized as making some of the worlds best wine California makes most of the wine that is made in America

People first made wine in California in 1769 Missionaries from Mexico brought their wine plants to produce wine for the mass Later people coming from Europe improved the making of wine They had brought their own kinds of wine plants

Before 1920 there was more wine made every year Then Prohibition began During Prohibition it was not allowed to sell alcoholic drinks in the United States It almost ended the making of wine in California Californian wine making took a long time to recover

In 1990 the USA sent less than five percent of its wine to other countries After that exports of wine from California increased Today the USA is one of the big wine industries

Wine comes in different colors Most wines are called red or white White wine is not really white it just has a very light color 54 percent of the Californian wines are white wines Some examples of white wines are Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc Some examples of red wines are Zinfandel Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot and Pinot Noir

Grapes for wine used to need warm weather People wanted to grow more grapes so they learned how to grow them where the weather was not as warm That way of growing grapes is called cool climate viticulture Vines are now planted in colder places up to convert700mft above sea level Monterey County was the first place where that was done

In California there are more than 800 wine cellars Wine cellars are big rooms were wine is stored They are part of a winery the place where wine is produced

Two of the most famous growing areas for wine in California are Napa County and Sonoma County The wines from those places are some of the best in the world Some examples of the wines made there are Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon

Other known wineries are in Mendocino in the Lake Counties Santa Maria and Santa Barbara

Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a 1969 movie from 20th Century Fox George Roy Hill directed it and John Foreman produced it It stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford as two robbers in the American West who go to Bolivia to escape the law

The movie was loosely based on the real story of the two title characters But it made the legends of the two more popular

It won four Academy Awards for Best Cinematography Best Original Score Best Song and Best Original Screenplay It was also nominated for Best Picture Best Director and Best Sound

It was one of the largest grossing movies of the 1960s It was number fifty on AFIs 100 Years 100 Movies list

At first Warren Beatty and Steve McQueen were called upon to play the title roles When Newman and Redford took their place the roles were switched with Newman as Sundance and Redford as Cassidy The studio 20th Century Fox did not like Redfords role But the movies director Hill wanted it that way

As a result Redford has said that the movie made him a more famous actor

The Sundance Film Festival is named after Redfords role as well his Utah ski resort

Mehmed II was Sultan of the Ottoman Empire for a short time from 1444 to 1446 and later from 1451 to 1481 At the age of 21 he conquered Constantinople So he brought to an end to the medieval Byzantine Empire 

The Bold and the Beautiful is a popular soap opera in the United States After The Young and the Restless it is the highest rated soap opera there

The series is shown in over 100 countries About 300 million people watch it every day This makes The Bold and the Beautiful the most watched television series in the world The first episode was shown on March 23 1987 on the CBS network The series was created by the soap opera writer William J Bell and his wife Lee Phillip Bell It is the only American soap opera to have its daily episodes translated into Spanish for the Hispanic viewers in the United States

The series is set in Los Angeles California It tells the story of the Forrester family who owns a fashion empire called Forrester Creations The major members of the family are Eric Forrester the president of Forrester Creations his wife Stephanie their eldest son Ridge and Brooke Logan who was married to both the father and the son She owns most of Forrester Creations This is because she created BeLiEf a formula which earned much money for the company There used to be a second fashion company called Spectra Fashions It was Forresters main competitor The conflicts between the Forrester and the Spectra families was one of the major themes of the story

Primary colors are sets of colors that can be combined to make a useful range of colors The primary colors are those which cannot be created by mixing other colors in a given color space

For subtractive combination of colors as in mixing of pigments or dyes for printing the primaries normally used are cyan magenta and yellow though the set of red yellow blue is popular among artists

For additive combination of colors as in overlapping projected lights or in CRT displays the primary colors normally used are red green and blue

Primary colors are not a fundamental property of light but are related to the physiological response of the eye to light For humans three primary colors are usually used since human color vision is trichromatic

Fundamentally light is a continuous spectrum of the wavelengths that can be detected by the human eye an infinite dimensional stimulus space However the human eye normally contains only three types of color receptors called cone cells Each color receptor responds to different ranges of the color spectrum Humans and other species with three such types of color receptors are known as trichromats

Media that combine emitted lights to create the sensation of a range of colors are using the additive color system Television is the most common use of this 

The additive primaries are red green and blue Because of the response curves of the three different color receptors in the human eye these colors are optimal in the sense that the largest range of colors a gamut visible by humans can be generated by mixing light of these colors Additive mixing of red and green light produce shades of yellow or orange Mixing green and blue produces shades of cyan and mixing red and blue produces shades of purple and magenta Mixing equal proportions of the additive primaries results in shades of grey when all three colors are fully saturated the result is white The color space that is generated is called the RGB color space

Media that use reflected light and colorants to produce colors are using the subtractive color method of color mixing In the printing industry to produce the varying colors apply the subtractive primaries yellow cyan and magenta together in varying amounts Subtractive color works best when the surface or paper is white or close to it

Mixing yellow and cyan produces shades of green mixing yellow with magenta produces shades of red and mixing magenta with cyan produces shades of blue In theory mixing equal amounts of all three pigments should produce shades of grey resulting in black when all three are fully saturated but in practice they tend to produce muddy brown colors For this reason a fourth primary pigment black is often used in addition to the cyan magenta and yellow colors

The color space generated is the so called CMYK color space The abbreviation stands for Cyan Magenta Yellow and Black K stands for Kohle and is used to represent black as B could be confused with Blue

In practice mixtures of actual materials like paint tend to be less precise Brighter or more specific colors can be created using natural pigments instead of mixing and natural properties of pigments can interfere with the mixing For example mixing magenta and green in acrylic creates a dark cyan  something which would not happen if the mixing process were perfectly subtractive In the subtractive model adding white to a color does not change its hue but does reduce its saturation In fact adding white usually does change the hue slightly for example adding white to red makes it slightly bluish or pink

The umbilicus is a scar on the body of mammals that is left after a baby loses its umbilical cord The umbilicus of humans is in the middle of the abdomen It is usually only easy to see on humans and is a thin line on many other mammals In humans they can be split into two different kinds the kind that goes in and the kind that goes out Different people have different navels that can be different in size shape and looks but these differences are not genetic The hepatic portal vein passes from the umbilical vein to the liver When a person becomes fat the fat usually goes around the umbilicus

Captain James Cook FRS was an English explorer navigator and cartographer He made three voyages to the Pacific Ocean mapping many areas and recording several islands and coastlines on European maps for the first time He is most notable for the British finding the east coast of Australia finding the Hawaiian Islands and the first mapping of Newfoundland and New Zealand 

During his lifetime he sailed twice around the world He crossed the Antarctic Circle and found new islands and landscapes in North America and the South Pacific During his trips he spent a lot of time on science experiments and mapping new areas He also wrote a lot of books about what he found 

Cook was born on 27 October 1728 in Marton in He was a son of a Scottish farmer He was educated at the school in Great Ayton and at 17 he began work in a shop at Staithes At 18 Cook became a sailor and became an apprentice to John Walker of Whitby Walkers business was transporting coal Cook learned mathematics and navigation from Walker Cook was not just a normal seaman He studied as much as he could That is how he learned a lot of good knowledge about navigation and science He was sent on three expeditions with the ship called Endeavour all over the world

His goals on these missions were

At the beginning it was an honour to be on these expeditions After a while money was the most important reason for doing his jobfactdateJuly 2010 After his death his wife inherited 70000 gold coinsfactdateJuly 2010

The offside rule is one of the oldest football rules but is still a much discussed rule This is because it is difficult for the referee or assistant referee to watch the ball the player playing the ball and also the attacker who is seeking to receive the ball at the same time 

Offside is an offence committed by the team which has the ball and is punished with an indirect free kick It is a common misconception that the ball must be played forward for an offside offense to be committed This is incorrect however as an offside offense is related to the position of the ball and the player receiving it rather than the direction it is played If the player is in front of the ball when it is played and has not got at least two defending players closer to the defending goal line than they are she or he is in an offside position 

But there are some exceptions

Valentines Day is a holiday that happens on February 14 It is the day of the year when lovers show their love to each other This can be done by giving flowers chocolates or Valentines cards Love notes can be given to one another These notes are called valentines

Symbols of Valentines Day are heart shapes roses and Cupid with his arrows

Valentines Day is named for two martyred Christian saints named Valentine 

Since the 14th century Valentines pairs are formed in England English emigrants took the Valentines custom to the United States After the Second World War US soldiers brought this festival to Europe

In the third century after Christ Valentine was the bishop of Terni He performed weddings for couples who were not allowed to get married They may not have been allowed to get married because the parents did not agree with the connection or because the bridegroom was a soldier or a slave so the marriage was forbidden Valentine gave to the married pairs flowers from his garden Thats why flowers play a very important role on Valentines Day This did not please the emperor On February 14 269 AD Valentin was beheaded because of his Christian faith

An expansion of the legend combines the day of death of Valentine with the Roman festival Lupercalia It was the festival of the great goddess Lupa which is the feminine word for wolf She was the Great She Wolf who nursed the twin babies Romulus and Remus who later became the founders of Rome During the annual ceremony the temple priestesses wrote their names on strips of papyrus These were picked by young men After the lottery the youngsters walked through the city and got the blessings of the citizens The martyr Valentine became the patron saint of the lovers Still in the Middle Ages as in France or in Belgium people were chosen by the lottery to live a year with each other and people prayed to Saint Valentin to make love potions and charms

In the 19th century the custom of sending Valentines Cards became very popular The cards usually have pictures of hearts or flowers and contain some sort of poem message or code Codes and simple messages give some people the broken wikt linkcouragecourage to show their true feelings to the person they love Today some people still use mysterious codes to show their love People can use newspapers to give a coded message to their loved one giving other readers a view of the couples broken wikt linkintimacyintimacy with one another 

Famous for the popularity of the celebration is the folk song called Die Vogelhochzeit

In China a holiday called Qi Xi is also called Chinese Valentines Day especially by younger people Qi Xi is traditionally held on the 7th day of the 7th month of the lunar calendar In recent years it has become more like Valentines Day in other countries

The Canary Islands are a group of islands off the coast of Morocco They are an autonomous community of Spain There are seven main islands The people who live there speak Spanish The autonomous community has two capital cities of equal status Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria Every island has been created by volcanoes on the bottom of the sea Those volcanoes slowly rose until they rose above the water and made the islands This process lasted many thousands of years

The islands have a very long and interesting history When Europeans first came to the Canary Islands they found people already living there These people were called the Guanches Many of the Guanches were killed in battles with the Spanish and the ones who remained adopted the Spanish way of life Many battles with the Spanish were fought for the islands before Spain claimed them After the Spanish conquest many battles were also fought against pirates The most recent of countries interested in them was Morocco 

After the Spanish conquest many Europeans settled there Portuguese and Spaniards and also Belgians and Maltese were among the early settlers Recently many people from all over Europe America India and Africa have also became citizens or permanent residents

The seven islands are La Palma La Gomera El Hierro Tenerife Gran Canaria Lanzarote and Fuerteventura People from La Gomera have a whistle language which children there learn at school Tenerife has the highest mountain in the Canary Islands and Spain too the Teide The Teide is actually a volcano but it has not been active in more than 300 years 

The islands are popular with tourists because of their warm climate and nice beaches The local farmers grow lots of exotic fruits including papayas and bananas

The Canary Islands main exports include bananas and tobacco

Edinburgh Airport is an airport in Scotland It is one of seven airports in the United Kingdom owned by the company BAA which also owns Glasgow Airport and Aberdeen Airport in Scotland It is served by many different airlines including Scot Airways British Airways EasyJet BMI Continental Airlines Air France and Lufthansa The airport has good road links to the city centre with a bus running every 10 minutes from the airport to the centre of Edinburgh a number of taxis are always available Just over 9 million people a year use the airport but there are plans to make the airport bigger in the future

On 19th October 2011 BAA Limited said that it is going to sell Edinburgh Airport This was done following a decision by the UKs Competition Commission which said that BAA needs to sell either Glasgow or Edinburgh Airport

In February of 2001 a Shorts 360 crashed shortly after taking off from Edinburgh Airport Both pilots were killed but there were no passengers on board as it was a mail carrying flight 

Lufthansa is the largest airline in Germany and the second largest in Europe Some of Lufthansas hubs are Frankfurt am Main and Munich A hub is an airport where people who fly from one city to a second city can transfer or change airplanes 

Lufthansa buys airplanes from Boeing and Airbus Lufthansa has big airplanes for flights to North America Asia and Africa These flights are called long haul flights because they are between cities that are far apart from each other Lufthansa also has small airplanes for flights in Europe These flights are called short haul flights 

Lufthansa is a member of the Star Alliance which means it is a partner with other airlines like United Airlines and Air Canada Members of the Star Alliance cooperate or work together to schedule their flights better so that travelling is easier for passengers or people 

The name of Lufthansas frequent flyer program is Miles and More People earn points for flights they travel on When they have enough points they can get a free flight Lufthansa has Miles and More to encourage people to fly with Lufthansa

Lufthansa uses these aeroplanes 

Orlando Jonathan Blanchard Bloom is an English actor He is most known for his first major movie role as the elf Legolas Greenleaf in the The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy

In 1993 he moved to London to improve his career doing bit parts in TV series like Casualty Then he played some theatres like The Seagull Twelfth Night and Trojan Women This is a role that he received some days before graduating the drama school in London

Here are some movies in which he played an important character

The year of 1791 started on a Saturday in the Gregorian calendar

Chromium is a chemical element Its symbol on the periodic table is Cr Its atomic number is 24Its mass number is approximately 54 It always has 24 protons Most of the times it has 28 neutrons but sometimes different isotopes have more or less neutrons As a metal it has 24 electrons Its ions have less electrons

Chromium is a shiny metal It is reactive but it reacts with air to produce a very thin coating of chromium oxide which prevents it from rusting any more 

It forms chemical compounds that are colorful They can be green yellow purple red orange black and blue

There are two main types of chromium ions which are found in chromium compounds One type of chromium ion is required by our body and by those of other animals If we do not get enough chromium certain parts of our body may not work properly We get most of the chromium we need from our food we eat Chromium is also put into vitamins to make sure that we get enough If we get too much of this type of chromium it can harm our body

Another type of chromium can cause cancer or make people sick even though most people do not get exposed to it much Hexavalent chromium was important in the movie Erin Brockovich It is found in places that make chromium metal which is why they need to be cleaned up when they close Hexavalent chromium can be destroyed by reacting it with reducing agents turning it into Cr3 They are strong oxidizing agents

Chromium occurs as chromite Chromite is a mixture of iron oxide and chromium oxide Its chemical formula is FeCr2O4 It is heated with sodium carbonate to make sodium chromate iron oxide and carbon dioxide The sodium chromate is reacted with sulfuric acid to produce sodium dichromate The sodium dichromate is reduced by carbon to chromium oxide The chromium oxide is reacted with aluminum to make chromium metal The chromates and dichromates are what make chromium production areas toxic

Chromium is used in different metal products Stainless steel is the most common use It is also used in chrome plating where it makes things shiny and stops corrosion Some chromates were used as pigments but they are toxic so people do not want to use them anymore 

Chromium metal is nontoxic But hexavalent chromium is toxic and carcinogenic and trivalent chromium is mildly toxic in large quantities

Neon is a noble gas It is chemical element 10 on the periodic table Its symbol is Ne 

The word neon comes from the Greek word meaning new It was discovered by William Ramsay and Morris W Travers in 1898

Neon does not react with other elements so it is found by itself There is not much neon in the air and it is clear so we do not see it 

Neon gas is used in lamps When electricity goes through the neon it lights up in many different colors Due to this quality it is used in signs

Neon is also a term referring to a type of color that is very bright such as lime green

No true chemical compounds including the neutral compounds of neon are known Where there is the helium compound HHeF which might be stable the analogous componund with Neon is not 

Tin is a chemical element It is chemical element 50 on the periodic table The chemical symbol for tin is Sn It is in Group 14 on the periodic table It is not radioactive 

Tin is a silver somewhat soft metal It is a post transition metal Its melting point is 23193C and its boiling point is 2602C It can melt easily in a flame It is malleable It makes a crackling sound called tin cry when a piece of it is bent Tin has more non radioactive isotopes than any other element

Tin is found in two allotropes alpha tin and beta tin Alpha tin is a brittle dull powdery nonmetallic form of tin It is made when very pure tin is cooled Beta tin is the normal shiny soft conductive metallic form It is made at higher temperatures The decay of tin by turning from beta tin to alpha tin is called tin pest Alpha tin is not wanted in many places When small amounts of other elements like antimony are added the tin cannot change into alpha tin When alpha tin is heated it changes into beta tin

Tin can be hardened by adding antimony or copper as well as some other elements These also make it resistant to tin pest Tin can also be made very shiny Tin can make an alloy with copper called bronze

Tin is corrosion resistant to many things Salt water and fresh water do not affect it It does dissolve in strong acids to make tin salts It reacts with some strong bases Tin can act as a catalyst to make other things corrode when both of them are in a water solution that has dissolved oxygen

Tin forms chemical compounds in two oxidation states 2 and 4 2 compounds are reducing agents Some of them are colorless while others are colored 4 compounds are more unreactive and act more covalent

Tin burns in air to make tin oxide which is white Tin oxide dissolves in acids to make other tin compounds Tin chloride is a colorless fuming liquid when anhydrous and a white solid when hydrated It easily reacts with water to make tin oxide and an acid again 

Tin reacts with hydrohalic acids to make tin halides For example tin chloride is made when tin dissolves in hydrochloric acid Tin halides are made when tin reacts with the halogens Tin chloride is made when tin reacts with chlorine Tin sulfate is different as it does not oxidize to tin sulfate Tin oxide is a blue black solid that burns in air to make tin oxide

Tin is not found as a metal in the ground It is normally in the form of cassiterite Cassiterite is a mineral containg tin oxide The cassiterite is normally found downstream of the cassiterite deposit when it is by a stream or river Tin is also found in some complicated sulfide minerals

Tin does not have any major job in the human body

Tin is made by heating cassiterite with carbon in a furnace China is the biggest maker of tin

People discovered tin long ago and used it with other metals When copper and tin are mixed together bronze is made Bronze was important in the past because it was one of the strongest metals available which meant it was useful in weapons and tools Bronze changed the world when it was first invented starting the Bronze Age People organized themselves more because making tools from bronze was harder than making them from rock and wood like they did before

Tin is used in solder Solder used to contain a mixture of lead and tin Now the lead is removed because of its toxicity

Tin is also used to make pewter which is mainly tin mixed with a small amount of copper and other metals Babbitt metal also has tin in it Tin is used to coat several metals like lead and steel Tin plated steel containers are used to store foods The pipes on a pipe organ are made of tin Tin foil was used before aluminium foil Tin was one of the first superconductors to be found Organotin compounds are more common than almost any other organometal compound They are used in some PVC pipes to stop them from decaying Organotin compounds are toxic though

Tin is not toxic but tin compounds are very toxic to marine life They are a little toxic to humans

Silicon is element 14 on the periodic table Its symbol is Si

Silicon looks like a metal but does not do everything a metal does like conduct electricity very easily It is a metalloid Silicon is used a great deal in todays computers and virtually every electronic device Germanium can also be used in computers but silicon is easier to find 

There is a lot of silicon on the Earth At the beach there is silicon in the form of sand Sand is a compound of silicon known as silicon dioxide or silica Glass is made by heating sand hot enough The glass can have different colors by adding colored compounds Silicon also makes up a lot of different rocks and minerals and they are known as silicates

Silicon is a semiconductor

Cadmium is a metal It is element 48 on the periodic table Its symbol is Cd Its atomic number is 48 and its atomic mass is 1124 It is found in Group 12 on the periodic table

Cadmium is a blue gray soft metal It can be considered a transition metal or a post transition metal It is malleable and ductile It is similar to zinc It melts at 321C

Cadmium has 8 natural isotopes 5 are radioactive but 3 have very long half lives so their radioactivity is almost nothing 

Cadmium is a moderately reactive metal It corrodes in moist air and dissolves in acids It burns in air when powdered to make the brown cadmium oxide 

Cadmium forms chemical compounds in two oxidation states 1 and 2 The 1 state is rare and unstable The 2 state is much more common Most 2 compounds dissolve easily in water and are white to yellow Cadmium oxide can be brown red or white Cadmium sulfide is bright yellow Cadmium chloride and cadmium sulfate are colorless solids that dissolve easily in water Cadmium fluoride is slightly soluble

 FileCadmium chloride hemipentahydratejpgCadmium chloride FileOxid kademnatJPGCadmium oxide 

Cadmium was found by two separate people at the same time They were looking at an impurity in zinc carbonate and found cadmium For about 100 years Germany made most cadmium Cadmium iodide was used as a medicine although it was toxic

Cadmium ores are rare Greenockite a cadmium sulfide mineral is the only main ore and it is found with sphalerite a zinc sulfide Because of this most cadmium comes from zinc processing Cadmium as a metal is very rare but is found in one place in Russia

China makes the most cadmium South Korea and Japan also make cadmium Cadmium is taken from the zinc metal by heating the zinc metal in a vacuum Cadmium is boiled first The cadmium is condensed and used Cadmium is also taken by precipitating it from the solution of zinc sulfate used to make pure zinc by electrolysisfactdateDecember 2010

In the 1930s and 1940s cadmium was mainly used to plate steel to prevent it from corroding Then cadmium sulfide was used as a pigment in paint 

Now cadmium is mainly used in nickel cadmium batteries 86 of cadmium is used in batteries as of 2009 Some people are trying to stop using nickel cadmium batteries because of the cadmium Cadmium is still used to electroplate steel to prevent corrosion Only about 6 of cadmium is used for this Cadmium is also used in lasers nuclear reactors phosphors photoresistors pigments and semiconductors Woods metal an alloy that melts very easily has cadmium in it Cadmium is used in some solder 

Cadmium is not used in the human body or any other animal A diatom uses cadmium though 

Cadmium is a highly toxic metal Dust of cadmium or its compounds is very dangerous and can kill Some countries have banned cadmium from electronics Cigarette smoking is the most important source of cadmium Smokers have about 4 times more cadmium in their blood than nonsmokers Cadmium is thought to be carcinogenic although people still debate whether it is other things with the cadmium that cause cancer like arsenic

Krypton is a noble gas which means it does not react with many other elements It is clear and has no taste or smell The atmosphere is only about one millionth part krypton The name kypton comes from the Greek word kryptos meaning hidden It is used in fluorescent lamps flashbulbs and as a wavelength standard The metre is defined as 165076373 wavelengths in a vacuum of krypton gas Krypton has very few compounds

The main use for krypton is to make light There is one main type of krypton light bulbs This is called a gas discharge lamp There are three main types of these First is a low energy gas discharge lamp or neon light Low energy gas discharge lights made from krypton are near white to green Second is a high energy short length of time gas discharge light or flash bulb These are mostly used for photography They are bright blue white Third is a high energy gas discharge light This third kind is mostly used to light airport runways They are also bright blue white

Krypton is number 36 on the periodic table Its symbol is Kr

Krypton was found by Sir William Ramsay and Morris Travers in Great Britain in 1898 Ramsay was given the 1904 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on noble gases It was a difficult gas to discover Ramsay suspected it existed but only found it by removing other gases This is why he gave it the name Krypton There is no mineral called Kryptonite or planet called Krypton which features in the Superman comics by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster The fictional planet is probably better known than the real chemical element called Krypton

The noble gases are a group of elements that are all gases These elements are all in Group 18 of the periodic table They almost never react with other elements This is because they have a full outer electron shell There are six noble gases

All of these gases are found in air They make up around 096 of the atmosphere Noble gas compounds can be formed from noble gasses

When the noble gases are used in cold cathode tubes to produce light some noble gases have different colours Since Radon is radioactive it is usually not used for lighting Here are pictures of what the others look like

 ImageHeTubejpgHelium ImageNeTubejpgNeon ImageArTubejpgArgon ImageKrTubejpgKrypton ImageXeTubejpgXenon 

Ununoctium is probably the next noble gas after Radon However it has a half life of 089 ms after which it decays to Ununhexium This means its use is probably limited

Noble gases were discovered by Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay Rayleigh won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1904 for his work on noble gas Ramsay won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1904 for his work with noble gas

Polonium is a rare radioactive metalloid It is chemical element 84 on the periodic table and its symbol is Po It was discovered in 1898 by Marie and Pierre Curie

Polonium is highly unstable radioactive and toxic This makes it difficult to handle and potentially dangerous even in very small amounts One gram of Po will self heat to a temperature of around convert500CF It also vaporizes easily

Polonium has 33 isotopes and all of them are radioactive It is a very rare element in nature because of its short half life It is a breakdown product of uranium and hence it is found in uranium ores 

The former Russian secret service agent Alexander Litvinenko was murdered by having a tiny amount of polonium introduced into a drink

Bismuth is a chemical element It is element 83 on the periodic table and its symbol is Bi Its atomic mass is 209 It is only a very little radioactive The radioactivity is so little that it is seen as nonradioactive normally Bismuth is only found as one isotope naturally which is the almost nonradioactive one Its radioactivity was predicted by scientists and proven by analyzing the metal It is in Group 15 on the periodic table 

Bismuth is a silver metal with a pink tinge to it This pink color is because of its oxide coating Bismuth is a post transition metal It is one of the strongest diamagnetic metals It is almost as heavy as lead Its melting point is quite low convert2715CF which is normal for post transition metals It is quite brittle It can make crystals with a shiny surface This is because of the oxide coating too As a liquid it is heavier than as a solid Another chemical that does this is water It does not conduct electricity or heat very well

Bismuth is somewhat similar to antimony Bismuth makes a thin coating of bismuth oxide when it is in air This makes the colors on the crystals It does not oxidize any more than the oxide layer It burns when powdered with a bright blue flame making yellow bismuth oxide fumes Bismuth reacts with sulfur when molten as well Bismuth reacts with nitric acid to make bismuth nitrate and concentrated sulfuric acid to make bismuth sulfate and sulfur dioxide It reacts with the halogens to make bismuth halides With fluorine it makes bismuth fluoride unless the fluorine is diluted though

Bismuth forms chemical compounds in two main oxidation states 3 and 5 3 is the most common 3 compounds are weak oxidizing agents and are normally light yellow 5 compounds are strong oxidizing agents Bismuthates are the most common 5 compounds Bismuth fluoride is another 5 compound Bismuth oxide is an unstable red solid Bismuth sulfide is a common ore of bismuth Bismuthine a bismuth hydride is very unstable and only can be made at very cold temperatures Bismuth makes many oxy compounds like bismuth oxychloride These compounds are made when bismuth halides dissolve in water

Bismuth was known since ancient times It was confused with tin and lead though No one is credited for discovering bismuth In the 1500s people started realizing that bismuth was different than tin or lead

 FileBismitejpgBismite FileBismuth 243433jpgBismuth as a mineral FileBismuthinite 136224jpgBismuthinite Bismuth is not very common in the earth It is only about twice as common as gold Bismite a bismuth oxide mineral and bismuthinite a bismuth sulfide are two common ores Bismuth is sometimes found as a metal too

Bismuth and its minerals are too rare to be mined They are gotten by secondary extraction It is normally found in lead metal The lead metal is purified by electrolysis leaving the bismuth behind as a sludge on the bottom of the container The copper is taken out of the sludge and the bismuth is purified by being reduced in a furnace and all the impurities are filtered out

China makes the most bismuth Peru Mexico and Japan also make bismuth

Bismuth can also be recycled This is difficult in many places because bismuth is used for things like bullets solder and stomach medicine that get scattered all over and cannot easily be gotten again

Bismuth is used in alloys with very low melting points Some of them melt in hot water They are also found in solder that does not have lead in it It can make alloys with other metals to make them more malleable It is also used in bullets to replace lead In some places lead bullets are outlawed as birds eat them and get lead poisoning It is also used in alloys for plumbing It is used in fishing sinkers 

Bismuth is used in some medicines such as Pepto Bismol This medicine has bismuth subsalicylate in it It is also used as an internal deodorant and to treat eye infections and peptic ulcers

Bismuth oxychloride is used in cosmetics Bismuth telluride is used in electronic thermometers Another compound is used in superconductors and becomes a superconductor at a high temperature It can be used as a pigment and in fireworks to make crackling sounds It is used in the nuclear fuel of a nuclear reactor

Bismuth is much less toxic than other heavy metals This is why it is replacing lead in many things It does not add up in the body like other heavy metals do A very large amount of bismuth can poison the kidneys and liver though Because its oxide does not dissolve in water it is considered safe for the environment

Iridium is the 77th element on the periodic table Its symbol is Ir

Iridium is a metal It is very hard to find and costs a lot It is known as a noble metal It looks like platinum and is found in asteroids and comets It can be used to find out when an asteroid or comet will hit the Earth It is a very costly metal that can fold and bend just like aluminum It is very shiny

Iridium is not needed in the body

A man named Smithson Tennant first found it in the year 1803

The transition metals are a group of metals that are found in the middle of the periodic table They all have similar properties The alkaline earth metals are to the left and the Group 3 elements beginning with boron

Transition metals have several general properties They are harder and less reactive than the alkaline earth metals They are also harder than the post transition metals They make colorful chemical compounds with other elements Most of them have more than one oxidation state

Some of the transition metals are necessary to keep humans healthy such as iron zinc and chromium Other elements in the transition metals can be harmful to our body like cadmium and mercury Other elements like gold or silver do not really harm or help us There are more transition metals than any other groups in the periodic table

Only a few of the transition metals are colored most of them are silver gray or silver bluish

Osmium is a chemical element It is element number 76 on the periodic table Its symbol is Os

There is not much osmium on earth There is actually such a small amount that osmium is very expensive 

Osmium is a metal and it does not react very much and such a metal is known as a noble metal

It was discovered in 1804 by Smithson Tennant in London England He found it together with Iridium in a bit of Platinum which he had dissolved in Aqua regia

Radon is element 86 on the periodic table Its symbol is Rn

Radon is a gas and is part of the group known as the noble gases It does not react with other elements so it is found pure

Radon is radioactive meaning that it can give off harmful rays Some people have high levels of radon in their houses and this can be very dangerous A lot of radon can get stuck in the basement of old houses and so people end up breathing it in It gets stuck in the lungs and has been known to cause cancer There are groups that try to make sure there is no dangerous radon in houses

FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol it is mainly used to send and receive files on the Internet It was developed in 1985 and is defined in RFC 959

FTP is a way of accessing files on another computer The computer that is connected to is called a server the computer that connects to the server is called a client A server listens on the network for connection requests from other computers The client can make a connection to the FTP server by using FTP client software Once connected the client can do things such as uploading files to the server downloading files from the server and renaming or deleting files on the server

Many computer platforms support FTP This allows any computer to connected to a TCPIP based network to manipulate files on another computer on that network regardless of which operating systems are involved There are many existing FTP client and server programs many of these are available free

FTP connection is also seen in cellular phones when trying to transfer or receive data from a computer nearby 

FTP server return codes show their status by the digits within them A short explanation of various digits meanings are given below

Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a communications protocol It is used to send and receive webpages and files on the internet It was developed by Tim Berners Lee and is now coordinated by the W3C HTTP version 11 is the most common used version today It is defined in RFC 2616

HTTP works by using a user agent to connect to a server The user agent could be a web browser or spider The server must be located using a URL or URI This always contains http at the start It normally connects to port 80 on a computer

A more secure version of HTTP is called HTTPS This contains https at the beginning of the URL It encrypts all the information that is sent and received This can stop malicious users such as hackers from stealing it It is often used on payment websites

The request message contains the following

The request line and headers must all end with two characters a carriage return followed by a line feed often written The empty line must consist of only and no other whitespace In the HTTP11 protocol all headers except Host are optional

A request line containing only the path name is accepted by servers to maintain compatibility with HTTP clients before the HTTP10 standard

Ethernet is a way of connecting computers together in a local area network or LAN It has been the most widely used method of linking computers together in LANs since the 1990s The basic idea of its design is that multiple computers have access to it and can send data at any time This is comparatively easy to engineer 

Collisions are possible if two computers send data at the same time a fact that disallows its use if real time requirements are set A protocol called Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection or CSMACD was designed to deal with these problems

There are different Ethernet standards Today Ethernet looks like connecting cables that look like thick telephone cables to a set of boxes called hubs or switches Each cable runs from a computers network interface card to such a box This cable is called 10BaseT or 100BaseT or 1000BaseT Cable

All cable types

Today the cables for 10BaseT 100BaseT and 1000BaseT are the same They use unshielded twisted pair of Category 5 or 5e for that Shielded cable can be used when there is a lot of electrical noise and Category 6 works better with faster signals such as 1GBit or 10GBit

Other devices such as the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3 can also be connected using the same kind of cabling Certain computer peripherals for example printers and certain hard disks can be directly connected to the network with such cables

Ethernet can go at different speeds In the beginning Ethernet was at 10 MBits per second The Ethernet most often used today is at 100 MBits per second Most new computers now have the NIC built in and can go at 1GBit per second There are also standards for 1GBit per second and 10 GBit per second 100 MBit can usually talk to 10 MBit and 1 GBit can talk to 100 MBit and usually to 10 MBit

Obesity is the condition of being much too heavy for ones height such that ones health is affected In other words it means to be too overweight Also known as being fat

To know if a person is overweight the body mass index is calculated by dividing the weight by the height of the person in meters squared

The most common cause for obesity is getting more calories that are used by the body Other factors that often contribute to obesity are

Obesity is usually helped by diet and exercise Some people also use weight loss programs In severe cases drugs can be given In very severe cases weight loss surgery can be done

Phillips Academy is a high school for boys and girls in Andover Massachusetts near Boston USA  The school is a boarding school 75 of the students live there

Phillips Academy is the oldest private boarding school in the United States Two American Presidents George H W Bush and George W Bush went to school there

Phillips Academy was founded during the American Revolution as an all boys school in 1778 The great seal of the school was designed by Paul Revere George Washingtons nephews went to the school and he once spoke at an assembly while visiting John Hancock the famous signer of the United States Declaration of Independence signed the articles of incorporation

Phillips Exeter Academy was made three years later in Exeter New Hampshire by Samuel Phillips uncle John The football teams have played against each other almost every year since 1878 This makes their rilvalry one of the oldest high school rivalries in the country

Paul Revere put bees a beehive and the sun into the schools great seal The schools main motto Finis Origine Pendet means the end depends upon the beginning It is written at the bottom of the seal The schools second motto Non Sibi means not for self 

Gluttony is a wasting of resources Usually it is food that is wasted Either one person eats too much or the person does something so the food do not reach those who need it

In Christianity this is considered to be one of the Seven deadly sins

Greed is a desire to have more goods or more wealth than is needed Christianity says that greed is one of the Seven deadly sins There it is listed as avarice or in Latin avaritia

Profit is how much money somebody makes This is found by subtracting how much money they have spent from how much money they have brought in

If John spends 15 on some ice cream cones and then sells them for 20 he has made a profit of 5 This is because 20 minus 15 is 5

Roasting is a way of cooking Something gets roasted if it is put it over a fire and some is burnt The same effect can also be attained with a grill at a barbecue

In different countries people like to roast different things People usually roast joints of meats such as pork beef chicken lamb and duck The roasted meat along with its accompanying vegetables is often called a roast

Most meat being roasted has to cook for a relatively long time to ensure the joint is cooked through Variations to this include most joints of lamb and beef which may be better left pink or partially uncooked towards the centre for a better flavour

Other things can be roasted too For example vegetables coffee and chocolate Coffee and chocolate are always roasted

Influenza better known as the flu and sometimes called the grippe is a common childhood illness but is not as common among Adults It is not limited to humans most mammals and many birds can also catch influenza It is caused by several different viruses which is why people can have the flu more than once The name influenza comes from influenza meaning influence

Human Influenza can pass from one person to another very easily It is most commonly spread by the microscopic droplets of mucus and fluid that are sent into the air when the sick person coughs or sneezes Symptoms include cough sore throat muscle aches and pains fever headache and rarely vomiting and diarrhoea Influenza can also lead to other diseases such as pneumonia This makes it especially dangerous to young children and old people 

Although there is no cure for influenza Antiviral drugs can be used to treat the illness so it is not as severe and does not last as long 

the influenza season runs from late fall to spring because most people catch it in the winter months When there are more cases of influenza than expected it will sometimes be called an epidemic When there are a large number of cases of the same type of influenza all over the world it is often called a pandemic

Small changes that happen as flu is passed from one person to another is the most common way flu viruses change This is the main reason that people can catch the flu every year

The CDC keeps track of the different flu viruses that are circulating and gives this information to the companies that make flu shots Since the flu changes so much from year to year flu shots have to given for each new flu season

Flu shots only protect against the most common flu viruses and every now and then a slightly different type spreads more than expected Usually when this happens the existing flu shot gives some protection so that even if a person who had a flu shot catches it they do not get as sick

Some flu viruses are caught from animals Bird Flu for example is usually only caught by people in contact with sick birds These types of flu virus are usually very limited and while they can make a person very ill usually other people do not catch the virus from the sick person

Another way that the flu can change is when a person or animal catches two different flu viruses The two viruses can exchange some of their genetic information which can create a brand new flu that nobody has ever caught before 

If an animal flu virus changes in this way to one that can easily pass from human to human many people become ill because nobody has any immunity to the new virus Often a brand new virus is more severe and kills more people

New types of flu virus are usually what causes pandemics and that is the reason many scientists have been following Bird Flu so closely it kills six people out of every ten who catch it This would be a very serious problem if it changes enough to spread easily between people

This new flu virus got its name because it contains genetic parts that are commonly found in flu viruses that infect pigs It is not spread by pigs or by eating pork  this is a new human virus being spread by humans

Although information is still coming out about Swine Flu so far it does not seem to be as severe as Bird Flu or the flu that caused the Influenza Pandemic of 1918 but it is much too early to predict whether it will cause the next flu pandemic

The pancreas is an organ that makes hormones and enzymes to help digestion The pancreas helps break down carbohydrates fats and proteins The pancreas is behind the stomach and is on the left side of the human body

The part of the pancreas that makes hormones is called the Islets of Langerhans The Islets of Langerhans are a small part of the total cells in the pancreas The Islets of Langerhans change which chemical they make depending on how much of other chemicals are already in the blood So the pancreas works to keep the level of chemicals in balance in the body If the Islets of Langerhans stop working a person will suffer from a disease called diabetes Doctors are experimenting with taking the Islets of Langerhans cells from a donor body and putting them into the pancreas of a person with diabetes to make that person well

The pancreas belongs to two systems of the body the digestive system for its role in breaking down nutrients and the endocrine system for producing hormones

The pancreas releases these hormones

The pancreas releases many different enzymes to help digestion

Chloroplasts are small organelles inside the cells of plants and algae They absorb light to make sugar in a process called photosynthesis The sugar can be stored in the form of starch Chloroplasts contain the molecule chlorophyll which absorbs sunlight for photosynthesis In addition to chlorophyll a chloroplast uses carbon dioxide and water to form sugar and gives off oxygen Chlorophyll is what gives green plants their green colour Chloroplasts also contain various yellow and orange pigments to assist in photon capture for photosynthesis

Each choloroplast is surrounded by a double walled semi permeable membrane In the layered stacks are flat disk shaped thylakoids They contain light absorbing pigments including chlorophyll and carotenoids as well as proteins which bind the pigments Like mitochondria chloroplasts also contain their own DNA and ribosomes

Chloroplasts are one of the many different types of organelles in the cell They are thought to have originated as endosymbiotic cyanobacteria This was first suggested by Mereschkowsky in 1905 after an observation by Schimper in 1883 that chloroplasts closely resembled cyanobacteria Almost all chloroplasts are thought to derive directly or indirectly from a single endosymbiotic event 

Mitochondria also had a similar origin but chloroplasts are found only in plants and protista In green plants chloroplasts are surrounded by two lipid bilayer membranes They are thought to correspond to the outer and inner membranes of the ancestral cyanobacterium Chloroplasts have their own genome which is much smaller than that of free living cyanobacteria The DNA which remains shows clear similarities with the cyanobacterial genome Plastids may contain 60100 genes whereas cyanobacteria often contain more than 1500 genes Many of the missing genes are encoded in the nuclear genome of the host 

In some algae chloroplasts seem to have evolved through a secondary event of endosymbiosis in which a eukaryotic cell engulfed a second eukaryotic cell containing chloroplasts forming chloroplasts with three or four membrane layers In some cases such secondary endosymbionts may have themselves been engulfed by still other eukaryotes thus forming tertiary endosymbionts In the alga Chlorella there is only one chloroplast which is bell shaped

In some groups of mixotrophic protists such as the dinoflagellates chloroplasts are separated from a captured alga or diatom and used temporarily These klepto chloroplasts may only have a lifetime of a few days and are then replaced

Chlorophyll is a chemical found in the chloroplasts of plants that allows the plant to absorb light Energy from the light is used in photosynthesis to make glucose This contains lots of stored energy which the plant needs to release It does this through respiration This energy is then used for lots of different things like growing or repairing damaged parts of the plant Chlorophyll is also what gives the stem and leaf of the plant its green color

Chlorophyll is a green pigment found in almost all plants algae and cyanobacteria It absorbs light most strongly in the blue portion of the electromagnetic spectrum followed by the red portion However it is a poor absorber of green and near green portions of the spectrum hence the green color of chlorophyll containing tissues Chlorophyll was first isolated in 1817

Chlorophyll is vital for photosynthesis which allows plants to obtain energy from light

Chlorophyll molecules are arranged in and around the membranes of chloroplasts It serves two main functions The function of most chlorophyll is to absorb light and transfer that light energy to reaction centres These pigments are named after the wavelength of their red peak absorption maximum These chlorophyll pigments can be separated in a simple paper chromatography experiment

The function of the reaction center chlorophyll is to use the energy transferred to it from the other chlorophyll pigments to undergo a specific redox reaction In this reaction the chlorophyll gives an electron to an electron transport chain This reaction is how photosynthetic organisms such as plants produce O2 gas and is the source for practically all the O2 in Earths atmosphere Photosystem I typically works in series with Photosystem II 

The electron flow produced by the reaction center chlorophyll pigments is used to shuttle H ions across the membrane setting up a chemiosmotic potential used mainly to produce ATP chemical energy and those electrons ultimately reduce NADP to NADPH a universal reductant used to reduce CO2 into sugars as well as for other biosynthetic reductions

A green sea slug Elysia chlorotica has been found to use the chlorophyll it has eaten to perform photosynthesis for itself This process is known as kleptoplasty and no other animal has been found to have this ability

It still is unclear exactly why plants have mostly evolved to be green Green plants reflect mostly green and near green light to viewers rather than absorbing it Other parts of the system of photosynthesis still allow green plants to use the green light spectrum Green plants do not use a large part of the visible spectrum as efficiently as possible A black plant can absorb more radiation and this could be very useful notwitstandanding the problems of disposing of this extra heat More precisely the question becomes why the only light absorbing molecule used for power in plants is green and not simply black 

The biologist John Berman has offered the opinion that evolution is not an engineering process and so it is often subject to various limitations that an engineer or other designer is not Even if black leaves were better evolutions limitations can prevent species from climbing to the absolute highest peak on the fitness landscape Berman wrote that achieving pigments that work better than chlorophyll could be very difficult In fact all higher plants are believed to have evolved from a common ancestor that is a sort of green algae the idea being that chlorophyll has evolved only once 

Shil DasSarma a microbial geneticist at the University of Maryland has pointed out that species of archaea do use another light absorbing molecule retinal to extract power from the green spectrum He described the view of some scientists that such green light absorbing archae once dominated the earth environment This could have left open a niche for green organisms which would absorb the other wavelengths of sunlight This is just a possibility and Berman wrote that scientists are still not convinced of any one explanation

Chlorophyll is a chlorin pigment which is structurally similar to and produced through the same metabolic pathway as other porphyrin pigments such as haeme At the center of the chlorin ring is a magnesium ion For the structures depicted in this article some of the ligands attached to the Mg2 center are omitted for clarity The chlorin ring can have several different side chains usually including a long phytol chain There are a few different forms that occur naturally but the most widely distributed form in terrestrial plants is chlorophyll a The general structure of chlorophyll a was worked out by Hans Fischer in 1940 By 1960 when most of the stereochemistry of chlorophyll a was known Robert Burns Woodward published a total synthesis of the molecule In 1967 the last remaining stereochemical elucidation was completed by Ian Fleming and in 1990 Woodward and co authors published an updated synthesis In 2010 a near infrared light photosynthetic pigment called chlorophyll f might have been discovered in cyanobacteria and other oxygenic microorganisms that form stromatolites 

The different structures of chlorophyll are summarized below

Chlorophyll Content meters measure the optical absorption of a leaf to estimate its chlorophyll content Chlorophyll molecules absorb in the blue and red bands but not the green and infra red bands Chlorophyll content meters measure the amount of absorption at the red band to estimate the amount of chlorophyll present in the leaf To compensate for varying leaf thickness Chlorophyll Meters also measure absorption at the infrared band which is not significantly affected by chlorophyll The chlorophyll content of leaves can be non destructively measured using hand held battery powered meters The measurements made by these devices are simple quick and relatively inexpensive They now have large data storage capacity averaging and graphical displays

Measurement of the absorption of light is complicated by the solvent used to extract it from plant material which affects the values obtained

In Angiosperms the last step in the synthesis of chlorophyll is light dependent Such plants are pale if grown in the darkness Non vascular plants and green algae have an additional light independent enzyme and grow green in the darkness instead

Chlorosis is a condition in which leaves produce insufficient chlorophyll turning them yellow Chlorosis can be caused by a nutrient deficiency of iron called iron chlorosisor by a shortage of magnesium or nitrogen Soil pH sometimes plays a role in nutrient caused chlorosis many plants are adapted to grow in soils with specific pH levels and their ability to absorb nutrients from the soil can be dependent on this Chlorosis can also be caused by pathogens including viruses bacteria and fungal infections or sap sucking insects

The oak tree is a kind of hardwood forest tree Oak trees come in many different kinds of species but all of them have large seeds called acorns There are over 300 varieties of oak trees

Oak trees grow in many parts of Europe and North America Many people who own wooded land in these parts of the world are proud of their oak trees Oak is a climax vegetation in much of the Northern Hemisphere What that means is left untouched by humans it would be the dominant tree Much of England was covered by oak forests before modern farming took over the land The last extensive oak woodlands were cut down to build ships for the Royal Navy in the 18th century 

Some kinds of oak wood are very hard A lot of furniture was made from oak wood but the wood is now scarce and expensive Much cheaper are softwoods like pine

Most oak trees lose all of their leaves in autumn Some kinds of oak tree the live oak that grows in the American South or the Holm oak that grows in Europe keep their leaves through winter It is called the live oak in the United States of America because it keeps many of its leaves during winter

Oak trees can live up to 1000 years 

Main articleAcorn

Oak trees can start producing acorns when they are roughly 20 years old However they may reach 50 years before the first production When the tree is between 70 and 80 years old it produces thousands of acorns

Oak trees produce acorns once a year which ripen in Autumn The production changes every year Not even the healthiest and largest oak have enough energy to produce a lot of them two years in successioncitation neededdateJanuary 2012

Glucose is a simple carbohydrate or sugar It is important because cells in an organism use it as a source of energy Turning glucose into energy is called respiration Humans that do not have enough glucose have low blood sugar levels Its chemical formula is C6H12O6 This means it has 6 carbon atoms 12 hydrogen atoms and 6 oxygen atoms bonded together

The set of atoms in glucose can be linked in several different ways But all of the ways can be divided into two families of mirror images Only one set of these isomers exists in nature those derived from the right handed form of glucose called D glucose D glucose is often called dextrose The term dextrose is short for dextrorotatory glucose Solutions of dextrose rotate polarized light to the right Starch and cellulose are polymers made from the dehydration of D glucose The other stereoisomer called L glucose does not occur in nature very often Some people tried to use L Glucose as a low calorie sweetener But the manufacturing costs were too high

Cellulose is the main chemical that forms the main structure of plants

Cellulose is made from a form of glucose and makes up most of the cell wall of plant cells This is what keeps a plant in shape Cellulose is not digestible by humans

Wikiquote is a sister project of Wikipedia It is one of many projects run by the Wikimedia Foundation 

Wikiquote was based on an idea by Daniel Alston and made by Brion Vibber The goal of the project is to produce a large reference of quotations from famous people books and proverbs and to give details about them

The project was first created in English However in July 2004 more languages were added Some of there are

As of December 25 2010 25 versions each have more than 1000 articles The largest Wikiquote is the English project with over 19400 content pages followed by Polish and Italian versions both with over 11000 content pages In total 53 languages have over 100 content pages

In February 2010 the Simple English Wikiquote was locked and closed

The city was planned and developed in 1956 with Lcio Costa as the principal urban planner and Oscar Niemeyer as the principal architect Roberto Burle Marx was the landscape designer They created the Plano Piloto de Braslia Braslia was built in 41 months from 1956 to April 21 1960 

Viewed from above the main portion of the city resembles an airplane or a butterfly The Monumental Axis goes east west and holds government buildings and monuments The other axis is curved in a north south direction The city is commonly referred to as Capital Federal or simply BSB As the national capital Braslia is the seat of all three branches of the Brazilian government The city also hosts the headquarters of many Brazilian companies Planning policies place residential buildings around expansive urban areas The plan includes large avenues It divides the city into sectors with different purposes including accommodation and tourism The city is built around an artificial lake Lake Parano

Residents of Braslia are known as brasilienses or candangos In local usage the word Braslia usually refers only to the First Administrative Region within the Distrito Federal where the most important government buildings are Braslia has a unique status in Brazil as it is an administrative division rather than a legal municipality like nearly all cities in Brazil In the rest of Brazil Braslia is almost always means the Brazilian Federal District There are several satellite cities which are also part of the Federal District

The Braslia subway system has 24 stations on two lines convert42kmmiabbron long The subway currently covers the south half of the metropolitan area In 2010 a light rail line was added By 2014 the light rail line will go from the end of the north wing of the city to the airport in the south

Braslia International Airport is the main airport in Braslia connecting the capital to all major Brazilian cities and many airports in other countries It is the third most important airport of Brazil in terms of passengers and aircraft movements

Super Smash Bros Melee has many stages that players can battle on Most of the stages are based on Nintendo series like Mario Pokmon and The Legend of Zelda

Catalysis is the change in speed of a chemical reaction due to the help of a catalyst Unlike other chemicals which take part in the reaction a catalyst is not consumed by the reaction itself A catalyst may participate in many chemical reactions Catalysts that speed the reaction are called positive catalysts Catalysts that slow the reaction are called negative catalysts or inhibitors Substances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters and substances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic poisons

A catalyst is something which changes the rate of a chemical reaction An example is when manganese oxide is added to hydrogen peroxide and the hydrogen peroxide starts to break up into water and oxygen Catalysts are either of natural or synthetic origin Catalysts are useful because they leave no broken wikt linkresidueresidue in the solution they have speeded up A catalyst can also be used in a reaction again and again as it is not used up There are many catalysts in our body which play an important part in many biochemical reactions These are called enzymes Most catalysts work by lowering the activation energy of a reaction This allows less energy to be used thus speeding up the reaction The opposite of a catalyst is an inhibitor Inhibitors slow down reactions Some of them are found in snake venom and are dangerous for our nervous system or heart 

Hydrogen peroxide is a chemical compound Its molecular formula is H2O2 It is used as a cleaner and as hair bleach In a concentration of 3 it can be used to treat wounds Over time it will slowly become oxygen gas and water through decomposition 

Chemists often use hydrogen peroxide in chemical reactions It is a very strong oxidising agent when used with acid and water Oxidising agents take electrons from other compounds

Here hydrogen peroxide takes an electron from the Fe2 ions and becomes water

It can also be a reducing agent when used with other compounds When it acts as a reducing agent oxygen gas is also produced Reducing agents give electrons to other compounds This method is often used to make oxygen in laboratories

Hydrogen peroxide can be bought in shops when mixed with lots of water but is very dangerous when the concentration is higher It is flammable and causes burns

Somaliland is an unrecognized state in middle east Africa It borders the Republic of Djibouti to the west the Federal Republic of Ethiopia to the south and Somalia to the east

Somaliland was a British colony until 26 June 1960 when it became the Somaliland Protectorate an independent country On 1 July 1960 the Somaliland Protectorate joined a new country called Somalia and they formed the Somali Republic In May of 1991 after a war five families in the Somali Republic declared independence They formed Somaliland out of six political areas in northern Somalia 

Currently Somaliland is an unrecognized state This means that no country or international organization thinks that Somaliland is a real country Instead they include Somaliland as a part of Somalia 

Somaliland has a republican government with free elections The capital is Hargeisa

Most people in Somaliland speak Somali and Arabic Article 6 of the Constitution of 2001 says the official language of Somaliland is Somali but Arabic is a mandatory subject in school English is also spoken and taught in schools

The main Somali dialect is Standard Somali Standard Somali is spoken in most of Somalia and in countries that border it Standard Somali is used by almost all of the media in the Somaliland region

Almost all Somalilanders are Muslims This is because Islam is the state religion and praticing a religion other than Islam is against the law Small amounts of non Islamic traditions exist in Somaliland but Islam is very important to the Somali sense of national identity

Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky was a Russian mathematician He became known for his achievements in non euclidean geometry 

Lobachevsky was born in Nizhny Novgorod Russia His parents were Ivan Maksimovich Lobachevsky a clerk in a landsurveying office and Praskovia Alexandrovna Lobachevskaya In 1800 his father died and his mother moved to Kazan In Kazan Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky attended Kazan Gymnasium He graduated in 1807 and then went to Kazan University which was founded just three years earlier in 1804 

At Kazan University Lobachevsky was influenced by professor Johann Christian Martin Bartels Bartels was a former teacher and friend of German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss Lobachevsky received a Masters degree in physics and mathematics in 1811 In 1814 he became a lecturer at Kazan University and in 1822 he became a full professor He served in many administrative positions and was the rector of Kazan University from 1827 to 1846 He retired in 1846 After this event his health rapidly deteriorated In addition to teaching mathematics and physics at Kazan University Lobachevsky also was an astronomy teacher there He liked pie cake and cookies

In 1832 he married Varvara Alexivna Moisieva They had seven children

A wildebeest is an animal It is a large hoofed mammal that is part of the Bovidae familiy of animals There are two species of wildebeest Both live in Africa

Wildebeest grow to 115 to 140 metres and they weigh between 150 and 250 kilograms when they are fully grown They live in the plains and open woodlands in southern Africa The biggest herds can be found in the Serengeti desert Wildebeest can live for more than 20 years

Like other members of the same family they mainly eat grass But since in the African grasslands there is not always grass wildebeest are forced to wander to find food all year round In May about 15 million animals move from the grasslands to the woods In November they move back there is grass in the plains in summer

The cows will calve in summer in the plains After the females have given birth the breeding season begins The dominant males mark off some territory They do this with feces and with scent 

Wildebeest are an important part of the ecosystem With their dung they fertilize the ground and their trampling is good for new growth They also provide food for predators like lions and hyenas

Gnu or GNU may mean

A predator is an animal that hunts catches and eats other animals For example a spider eating a fly caught at its web is a predator or a pack of lions eating a buffalo The animals that the predator hunts are called prey

Predators are usually carnivores or omnivores Predators will hunt other animals for food Examples for predators are lions tigers Leopards crocodiles snakes eagles wolves killer whales and sharks 

Predators are usually defined as animals that eat other animals But to some scientists the word predator means an animal or any living organism that eats anything A cow eating grass will be a predator of that grass Plants are not predators because they make their own food

The Serengeti is a region of savannah in East Africa The south of it belongs to Tanzania The north of it is in Kenya It is about 30000 square kilometers and one of the greatest areas for wildlife 

It has more than 16 million herbivores and thousands of predators Wildebeests gazelles zebras and buffalos are the most common animals in the region

This area is most famous for the migration that takes place every year Every year around October nearly 15 million herbivores travel towards the southern plains crossing the Mara River from the northern hills for the rains And then back to the north through the west once again crossing the Mara river after the rains in around April This phenomenon is sometimes also called the Circular Migration

Also in this area is the archeologically significant Olduvai Gorge where some of the oldest hominid fossils are found

The Serengeti region contains the Serengeti National Park the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya

The park covers 14763 km of grassland plains and savanna as well as riverine forest and woodlands The park is in the north of the country bordered to the north by the national Tanzania and Kenyan border where it is continuous with the Masai Mara National Reserve To the southeast of the park is Ngorongoro Conservation Area to the southwest is Maswa Game Reserve and to the western borders are Ikorongo and Grumeti Game Reserves to the northeast is Loliondo Game Control Area

Few people are allowed to live in the National Park Exceptions the staff of the Park researchers and staff of Frankfurt Zoological Society and staff of the various lodges and hotels The main settlement is at Seronera

The park has three regions

As well as the migration of ungulates the park has a healthy stock of other resident wildlife especially the Big Five

The park also supports many further species including cheetah Thomsons and Grants gazelle topi eland water buck hyena baboon impala African wild dog and giraffe The park also boasts about 500 bird species including ostrich secretary bird Kori bustard crowned crane marabou stork martial eagle lovebirds and many species of vultures

Ngorongoro is the crater of a huge extinct volcano which is part of the Serengeti area 

The Ngorongoro Conservation Area is a UNESCO World Heritage Site 180 km west of Arusha in the Crater Highlands area of Tanzania 

The main feature of the NCA is the Ngorongoro Crater a large volcanic caldera The crater which formed when a giant volcano exploded and collapsed on itself some two to three million years ago is convert610mabbron deep and its floor covers convert260km2abbron 

Estimates of the height of the original volcano range from fifteen to nineteen thousand feet high

Although thought of as a natural enclosure for a very wide variety of wildlife up to 20 or more of the wildebeest and half the zebra populations leave the Crater in the wet season The Ngorongoro lions are significantly inbred with many genetic problems passed from generation to generation This is due to the very few new bloodlines that enter the local gene pool because few migrating male lions enter the crater from the outside Those who do enter the crater often cannot contribute to the gene pool The craters male lions because of their large size easily expel outside competitors 

Animal populations in the crater include most of the species in East Africa but there are no impalas giraffes or crocodiles

The crater highlands on the side facing the easterly trade winds receives 8001200 mm of rain a year and is covered largely in montane forest while the less steep west wall receives only 400600 mm this side is grassland and bushland dotted with Euphorbia bussei trees The crater floor is mostly open grassland with two small wooded areas dominated by Acacia xanthophloea

The Munge Stream drains Olmoti Crater to the north and is the main water source draining into the seasonal salt lake in the center of the crater This lake is known by two names Makat as the Maasai called it meaning salt and Magadi The Lerai Stream drains the humid forests to the south of the Crater and it feeds the Lerai Forest on the crater floor  when there is enough rain the Lerai drains into Lake Magadi as well Extraction of water by lodges and NCA headquarters reduces the amount of water entering Lerai by around 25

The other major water source in the crater is the Ngoitokitok Spring near the eastern crater wall There is a picnic site here open to tourists and a huge swamp fed by the spring and the area is inhabited by hippopotamus elephants lions and many others Many other small springs are around the craters floor and these are important water supplies for the animals and local Masaai especially during times of drought

Aside from herds of zebra gazelle and wildebeest the crater is home to the Big Five Game of rhinoceros lion leopard elephant and buffalo The crater plays host to almost every individual species of wildlife in East Africa with an estimated 25thinsp000 animals within the crater

Following the recommendations of a committee of scientists after the 2000 drought an ecological burning program was implemented in the crater which entails annual or biannual controlled burns of up to 20 of the grasslands Maasai are now permitted to graze their cattle within the crater but must enter and exit daily FileNgorongoro Spitzmaulnashorn edit1jpgBlack rhinoceros in the crater FileSafari vehiclesjpgSafari vehicles in the Ngorongoro crater FileZebras Ngorongoro CraterjpgPlains zebras in the Crater FileMasaai with cattlejpgMasaai herdsman with cattle inside the crater FileClusterofChileanFlamingosjpgFlamingos at Ngorongoro 

The conservation area also protects Olduvai Gorge in the plains area It is considered the seat of humanity after the discovery of the earliest known specimens of the human genus Homo habilis as well as early hominidae such as Paranthropus boisei

The Olduvai Gorge or Oldupai Gorge is a steep sided ravine in the Great Rift Valley which stretches along eastern Africa Olduvai is in the eastern Serengeti Plains in northern Tanzania and is about thirty miles long It is in the rain shadow of the Ngorongoro highlands and is the driest part of the region 

It is one of the most important prehistoric sites in the world Research there has greatly developed our understanding of early human evolution Excavation work there was pioneered by Mary and Louis Leakey in the 1950s It is still continued today by their family During the Pleistocene the site was that of a large lake the shores of which were covered with successive deposits of volcanic ash Around 500000 years ago seismic activity diverted a nearby stream which began to cut down into the sediments revealing seven main layers in the walls of the gorge
