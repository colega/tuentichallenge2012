The Manchester code is a binary encoding which also encodes the clock signal This is very useful because an external clock signal is no longer needed A sequence of bits modulates the phase of the signal This is a form of Phase shift keying often shortened to PSK

Otherwise put the information about the signal is in its signal flanks that is when the signal changes

Manchester codes are widely used for example for Ethernet or for RFID 

There are two ways to represent a Manchester code

To rule out ambiguities Manchester codes use a preamble A preamble is a fixed sequence that is known beforehand

One of the advantages of Manchester code is that the DC component of the signal carries no information This makes it possible that standards that usually do not carry power can transmit this information One of the drawbacks of the encoding is that it needs more bandwidth than other encodings such as NRZ

George Roger Waters is an English rock musician He is best known as the bass player co lead singer principle lyricist and founding member of the English rock band Pink Floyd Roger became the primary lyrical contributor in Pink Floyd after the departure of fellow founding member Syd Barret in January 1968 and sang lead vocals on at least one half of all Pink Floyd tracks during his tenure with the band Many consider 1973 1979 to be the Golden Age of the Waters era Pink Floyd during which time they released four studio albums including two of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed rock albums ever created

Released in 1973 The Dark Side of the Moon is one of the top selling albums of all time Pink Floyd followed the epochal success of Dark Side with Wish You Were Here Animals and 1979s The Wall a double album considered by many to be rocks finest The Wall based on the life struggles of Roger Waters is the best selling double disk of all time and as Pink Floyds second unequivocally definitive album it solidified their status amoung the worlds elite rock bands In 1983 Pink Floyd released their tenth studio album The Final Cut Written and almost entirely sung by Roger it is the only Pink Floyd album on which Waters is credited for the writing and composition of every song In retrospect The Final Cut is more fairly considered Rogers first solo album essentially using David Gilmour and Nick Mason as studio musicians One of rock musics most critically acclaimed and commercially successful acts Pink Floyd has sold over 200 million albums worldwide including 745 million in the United States

Following his legal and philosophical split with Pink Floyd in 1986 Waters began a solo career releasing three studio albums The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking Radio KAOS and in 1992 the highly acclaimed Amused to Death In 1990 Roger staged one of the largest rock concerts ever The Wall Concert in Berlin on the vacant terrain between Potsdamer Platz and the Brandenburg Gate In 2005 he released the critically acclaimed opera a Ira which would go on to top the classical charts in America and Britain as well as joining Nick Mason Richard Wright and David Gilmour for an historical performance at the 2 July 2005 Live 8 concert in Londons Hyde Park Pink Floyds first public performance with Roger in 24 years

Waters has toured extensively as a solo act since 2005 performing Dark Side to sold out audiences and critical acclaim the world over Rogers manager Mark Fenwick has recently confirmed that Roger is considering touring The Wall in 2010 and 2011

Big Max is a type of squash that can grow to be more than 100 pounds They can also be convert20inmmabbron in diameter if they are grown properly They are commonly called pumpkins but this is not entirely correct Big Max are instead squash type pumpkins They have a bright orange color with fine grained yellow orange flesh The skin has deep lines in it and is slightly roughened and can be up to convert3to4inmmabbron thick This makes Big Max squash good for keeping The flesh is good for being canned and frozen 

However because they are so big cooking with these squash is hard They are said to not be as flavorful as smaller pumpkin varieties The variety was broken wikt linkhybridizedhybridized or created for its large size They have been grown as big as 300 pounds Individual fruits are round to slightly flattened 

These squash are best planted between two and four weeks after the average last frost and they become ripe 110 to 120 days after being planted The plants need lots of room to grow well and to get them very big only one fruit should be grown on one vine They are harvested before the first light frost when the plants leaves die Although broken wikt linkrecommendationsrecommendations are different seeds are often planted at convert1to3cminabbron deep spaced convert3to8cminabbron apart

Dormice are small rodents with a body length of between convert6and19cmabbron and weighing between convert15and200gabbron They are usually mouse like in appearance but they have furry tails instead of scaly tails They are usually arboreal animals They move quickly and are good at climbing Most species are nocturnal Dormice have a very good sense of hearing They make noises to each other with different sounds using their voices

Dormice are omnivorous usually eating fruits berries flowers nuts and insects Dormice are different to all other rodents because they do not have a cecum which is a part of the gut Other animals use the cecum to ferment plants Their teeth are like squirrels but they often do not have premolars

Dormice breed one or two times per year having an average of four young after a gestation period of 2132 days Dormice can live for as long as five years The young are born without hair and they cannot do anything for themselves Their eyes do not open until about eighteen days after birth They are usually ready to reproduce after the end of their first hibernation Dormice live in small family groups The area they live in depends on which species they are and how much food is available

One of the main characteristics of dormice that live in temperate zones is hibernation Dormice can hibernate six months out of the year or even longer if the weather remains cold enough They sometimes wake for a short amount of time so that they can eat food which they had previously stored nearby During the summer they store fat in their bodies to give the dormouse the energy it needs to survive through the hibernation period

Hibernation is where the name dormouse comes from The Anglo Norman word dormeus means sleepy the word was later changed to resemble the word mouse The sleepy behaviour of the Dormouse character in Lewis Carrolls Alices Adventures in Wonderland also shows this trait

The edible dormouse was thought to be a special food in ancient Rome It was eaten as an appetizer or as a dessert When it was eaten as a dissert it would be dipped in honey and poppy seeds The Romans had a special place to keep dormice which was called a glirarium Dormice are still eaten in Slovenia Dormouse fat was used by the Elizabethans to induce sleep

The earliest fossil evidence of dormice has been found in Europe from the early Eocene times They were in Africa in the upper Miocene Their appearance in Asia was not as long ago Many types of extinct dormouse species have been found During the Pleistocene giant dormice the size of large rats lived on the islands of Malta and Sicily

The family consists of 34 living species in three subfamilies and 10 genera

Family Gliridae

The Martial Eagle is a bird of prey It lives in Africa and is the biggest eagle in Africa 76 to 96 cm long and its wingspan is 188260 cm long Because it is so big it can kill a small antelope called duikers and eat it but it could not carry it up to its big nest in the tree

The Hazel Dormouse or Common Dormouse is a small mammal and the only living species in the genus Muscardinus It is Convert6to9cm long with a tail of Convert57to75cm It weighs Convert17to20g although this increases to Convert30to40g just before hibernation The Hazel Dormouse hibernates from October to April May

The Hazel Dormouse is native to northern Europe and Asia Minor It is the only dormouse native to the British Isles although the edible dormouse has been accidentally introduced to the British Isles and has an established population In British sources it is normally called the Dormouse rather than the Hazel Dormouse

The locations in the UK where the Hazel Dormouse can be found is shown on the National Biodivestity Network website

The Hazel Dormouse is a European Protected Species and is protected in the UK under the Wildlife and Countryside Act

The Hazel Dormouse is the only small mammal in Britain to have a completely furry tail It has golden brown fur and large black eyes It is a nocturnal creature and spends most of its waking hours looking for food in trees It will make long trips in tree branches instead of coming down to the ground This is to avoid danger

In winter the Hazel Dormouse will hibernate in nests beneath the leaf litter on the forest floor When it wakes up in spring it builds nests out of honeysuckle bark fresh leaves and grasses If the weather is cold and wet and there is not much food it saves energy by going into torpor It curls up into a ball and goes to sleep The Hazel Dormouse spend a large amount of its life sleeping either hibernating in winter or in torpor in summer

Examination of hazelnuts may show a neat round hole in the shell This shows that it has been opened by a small rodent like the dormouse Wood Mouse or Bank Vole Other animals including squirrels or jays will either split the shell completely in half or make a jagged hole in it

If you look closer at the hole the inner rim of the hole will have toothmarks which are at an angle to the hole The toothmarks are parallel with rough marks on the nut surface if a Wood Mouse made the hole The Bank Vole leaves parallel grooves with no rough marks

It feeds on a different foods which it can find in trees

The Hazel Dormouse needs different food sources at different times of year is required to survive

The edible dormouse or fat dormouse is a small dormouse and the only species in the genus Glis

Fat dormice are the largest dormice in Europe The ancient Romans used to breed them to be eaten This is the reason for the word edible in its name The dormice were kept in large pits or in terra cotta containers which were like modern hamster cages

Wild edible dormice are still eaten in Slovenia and trapping Dormouse is a Slovenian tradition Using dormice for food and fur is mentioned in documents which were written in the 13th century They also mention the use of dormouse fat as a medicine Poor and hungry peasants would eat dormice during winter because it is a good protein source

In February 2010 her family filed a new claim for murder The Bretnacher family lawyer is William Bourdon the secretary general of the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues and the lawyer of Transparency International

In March 2010 a judicial inquiry is opened in Paris for kidnapping sequestration followed by murder

One year later her friends who were successful in raising 60 000 people on Facebook groups from many European Nations launched a request for the second consecutive year in order to obtain some answers

At the end of 2010 two years after her disappearance more than 45000 people from different countries took part to another Facebook event for Ophlie and on December 4th her friends announced that they will organize a new Internet mobilization 

We will create an event for Ophlie every year until full light will be shed on her disappearance and death until justice is done 

Two years after her disappearance on December 4th 2010 Maitre William Bourdon said that the investigation continues The article also notes

 The complete analysis of diatoms which would have allowed knowing with certainty the location of drowning has not been obtained yet

 All required documents have not been sent 

 The telephone terminals on the path of Ophlie have not been exploited yet

A plastid is a self reproducing organelle of plants and algae A plastome is the DNA genome of a plastidp341

Examples of plastids are 

Plastids are one of the many different types of organelles in the cell In endosymbiont theory plastids originated as cyanobacteria This was first suggested by Mereschkowsky in 1905 after an observation by Schimper in 1883 that chloroplasts closely resemble cyanobacteria 

Almost all chloroplasts are thought to derive directly or indirectly from a single endosymbiotic event Mitochondria also derive from symbiosis but chloroplasts are found only in plants and protista The chloroplast is surrounded by a double layered composite membrane with an intermembrane space further it has reticulations or many infoldings filling the inner spaces The chloroplast has its own DNA which codes for redox proteins involved in electron transport in photosynthesis

Renaissance medicine is the term used for the development of medicine at the time of the Renaissance in Europe Scientists began to study the body and treat its diseases One scientist said that the body is mostly chemicals so it should be healed by chemicals Other scientists studied anatomy By learning the positions of bones muscles and organs they were able to give better treatment The Englishman William Harvey discovered that blood is pumped by the heart travels through the body in blood vessels and returns back to the heart in the circulatory system This made medical research in the 1600s much better and easy to understand 

In the renaissance a very important yaya theory in medicine was a system called Four humours or Four temperaments This theory was based on earlier works and influenced medical development until the 19th century According to the theory the body was filled with four different substances called humours When a person is healthy these substances are in balance When there is an imbalance between the humours the person will be sick The sickness can be cured by bringing the four humours back to balance The four substances are broken wikt linkbileblack bile yellow bile phlegm and blood Avicenna still supported that theory but refined it in many ways 

Rhazes was the first physician to show that the theory of four humors was wrong in his Doubts about Galen He carried out an experiment which would upset this system He inserted a liquid with a different temperature into the body This would result in an increase or decrease of bodily heat which resembled the temperature of that particular fluid Rhazes noted that a warm drink would heat up the body to a degree much higher than its own natural temperature The drink would therefore trigger a response from the body rather than transferring only its own warmth or coldness to it Avenzoar carried out an experimental dissection and autopsy to prove that the skin disease broken wikt linkscabiesscabies was caused by a parasite This discovery upset the theory of humorism The removal of the parasite from the patients body did not involve purging bloodletting or any other traditional treatments associated with the four humors Ibn al Nafis then discredited the theory of four humors after his discovery of pulmonary circulation and coronary circulation

Because there were only a few ways of studying how the body worked early doctors did not know how to cure sickness When a plague started they could not really know what to do for their patients except making them a little less painful One of their mistakes was that they thought the air carried the disease or that sickness was caused by flying venom so they covered their mouths or burned aromatic leaves but did not wash their hands after seeing a sick friend or family memberWhen William Harvey practiced medicine in 1618 only a few of his friends were trying to find out how the body worked and only a few doctors believed Harvey when he said that the blood was pumped by the heart Most people thought he was a quack Slowly they began to see his findings were real

In the 17th century Anton van Leeuwenhoek and Robert Hooke developed the light microscope Using such a microscope Leeuwenhoek was the first to see bacteria in 1676 He called them animalcules and published his observations in a series of letters to the Royal Society The name bacterium was introduced much later by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in 1838

However there were still lots of strange cures For instance in his medical book Rosa Angelica John Gadesen wrote how he treated smallpox in the son of Edward II by putting him in a red room because red cures red It was thought by many people that red diseases could be cured by having the patient look at the color red 

Also doctors said that if an adder strike a man wash a black snail in holy water and give to the sick to drink Today of course doctors do not use this cure

Some cures not only didnt work they could be dangerous to the patient For instance when someone was sick doctors said that bad blood must be removed To remove the bad blood the doctor attached leeches to the patient When the leech was full the job was finished But when somebody was sick taking away their blood could make them very weak  they could even die As science and medicine grew better leeching was stopped until recently when doctors began sometimes using leeches on patients who had fingers or hands that were cut off reattached One of the greatest pains in reattachment is just after surgery when the blood pools under the skin and is very painful Doctors have found out that using leeches to drink the excess blood helps to make the pain smaller

Some cures really worked though Sometimes wounds that today we would use stitches were held together using beetles that had broken wikt linkpincerpincers The edges of the wound were pinched together by a big angry beetle When the pincers were pinching it firmly together the beetle head would be cut off Spider webs were used to help wounds clot Doctors are still looking into other cures that were used in the Renaissance to see if they can help todays medicine

When humans first learned how to control fire it was an important step in their evolution Humans could now eat cooked proteins and carbohydrates They could also work longer into the night hours because of the light from fire Finally fire gave them a protection against predators

The earliest evidence of humans using fire comes from many archaeological sites in East Africa like Chesowanja near Lake Baringo Koobi Fora and Olorgesailie in Kenya The evidence at Chesowanja is red clay shards that scientists are 142 million years old Scientists reheated some of the shards at the site and found that the clay must have been heated to 400C to harden

At Koobi Fora there are archaeological sites with evidence of control of fire by Homo erectus 15 million years ago with the reddening of sediment that can only come from heating at 200400C There is a hearth like depression at a site in Olorgesailie Kenya Some very tiny charcoal was found but it could have come from a natural brush fire

In Gadeb Ethiopia broken wikt linkfragmentsfragments of welded tuff that seemed to have been burned were found in Locality 8E but re firing of the rocks may have happened because of volcanoes erupting nearby These have been found among Acheulean broken wikt linkartifactsartifacts made by H erectus

In the Middle Awash River Valley cone shaped depressions of reddish clay were found that could be made by temperatures of 200C These features are thought to be burned tree stumps such that they would have fire away from their habitation site There are also burnt stones in the Awash Valley but volcanic broken wikt linkweldedwelded tuff is also in the area

The earliest certain evidence of human control of fire was found at Swartkrans South Africa Many burnt bones were found among Acheulean tools bone tools and bones with cut marks that were made by hominids This site also shows some of the earliest evidence of H erectus eating meat The Cave of Hearths in South Africa has burned deposits dated from 02 to 07 Ma BP as do many other places such as Montagu Cave and at the Klasies River Mouth

The most powerful evidence comes from Kalambo Falls in Zambia where many things related to the use of fire by humans had been found like broken wikt linkcharredcharred wood charcoal reddened areas broken wikt linkcarbonizedcarbonized grass stems and plants and wooden broken wikt linkimplementsimplements which may have been hardened by fire The place was dated through radiocarbon dating to be at 61000 BP and 110000 BP through amino acid racemization

Fire was used to heat silcrete stones to increase their works before they were knapped into tools by Stillbay culture This clue shows this not only with Stillbay sites that date back to 72000 BP but sites that could be as old as 164000 BP

An important change in the behavior of humans happened because of their control of fire and the light that came from the fire Activity was no longer restricted to the daylight hours Some mammals and biting insects avoid fire and smoke Fire also led to better nutrition though cooked proteins

Richard Wrangham of Harvard University argues that cooking of plant foods may have caused the brain to get bigger because it made complex carbohydrates in starchy foods easier to digest This made humans absorb more calories

Stahl thought that because some parts of plants like raw cellulose and starch are hard to digest in uncooked form they would likely not be a part of the hominid diet before fire could be controlled These parts include stems mature leaves enlarged roots and tubers Instead the diet was made up of the parts of the plants that were made of simpler sugars and carbohydrates such as seeds flowers and fleshy fruits Another problem was that some seeds and carbohydrate sources are poisonous Cyanogenic glycosides which are in linseed cassava and manioc amongst others are made non poisonous through cooking The teeth of H erectus and the wear on the teeth reflect the consumption of foods such as tough meats and crisp root vegetables

The cooking of meat as can be seen from burned and blackened mammal bones makes the meats easier to eat It is also easier to get the nutrition from proteins because the meat itself is easier to digest The amount of energy needed to digest cooked meat is less than that needed for raw meat and cooking gelatinizes collagen and other connective tissues as well it opens up tightly woven carbohydrate molecules for easier absorption Cooking also kills parasites and food poisoning bacteria

Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk is the eleventh episode of The Simpsons third season The name is in a grammatically incorrect form it must be called Burns verkauft das Kraftwerk The episode first started on December 5 1991 In this episode Mr Burns who is sad because he wishes to pursue many interests decides to sell the power plant to two German investors for 100 million dollars Homers incompetence quickly gets him fired by the Germans Meanwhile Mr Burns has lost all his respectability because he can no longer control anyone As a result he decides to buy back the plant Because the power plant has been so costly to maintain the Germans decide to sell the power plant back to Burns for 50 million dollars Determined to keep his enemies close at hand Burns rehires Homer and all is back to normal

In mathematics an interval is a group of numbers that includes all numbers between the beginning and the end Numbers that are larger than the beginning number and smaller than the end number are inside the interval and numbers that are smaller than the beginning number or larger than the end number are not in the interval The beginning number and end number may or may not be inside the interval An example of an interval might be from 33 to 15 Numbers like 4 8 95 14 and even 14999 are inside this interval Numbers like 4 2 32 20 and 15000001 are not inside this interval

To write an interval write either a square bracket or a parenthesis Examples of intervals are 100 100 30 4

Intervals can be separated by how they act at their ends Intervals can be closed open or mixed

An interval that is closed also includes the beginning and the end A closed interval that has 3 as the beginning and 54 as the end would include 3 54 and every number between 3 and 54 To write a closed interval use square brackets An example of an closed interval is 136 450

An interval that is open does not include the beginning or the end An open interval that has 3 as the beginning and 54 as the end would include every number between 3 and 54 but it would not include 3 or 54 To write an open interval use parenthesis An example of an open interval is

A mixed interval is open at one end and closed at the other end This means that the interval may include the beginning but not the end or it may include the end but not the beginning The interval 9 23 would include 9 but it would not include 23

Captain John Guy Dollman BA FLS was a British zoologist and taxonomist Dollmans Tree Mouse and Dollmans Vlei Rat are named after him 

Guy Dollman was the eldest son of the artist John Charles Dollman He was born on 4 September 1886 and went to St Pauls School He later went to St Johns College Cambridge In February 1907 when he was still a student he was employed by the Department of Zoology at the British Museum He he spent most of his working life there as Assistant Keeper of Mammals

In 1912 on an expedition to Vietnam he discovered and named the Tonkin Snub nosed Langur He joined the British Army in 1915 and obtained a commission in the 19th London Regiment He was injured in a bomb accident so he did not fight in the First World War

In 1919 he returned to the museum He was an adviser to the British group at the 1933 International Conference for the Preservation of the Flora and Fauna of Africa This was the most important meeting about protecting nature before the Second World War Dollman helped to decide which animal species needed protecting

He travelled and wrote a lot with Walter Rothschild Some of their writing included New mammals from Dutch New Guinea and a book about tree kangaroos which was called The Genus Dendrolagus He was also a very good artist showing pictures at the Royal Academy He also drew pictures for his own scientific writings 

Dollman died on 21 March 1942 when he was 65 years old

Dollman is the binomial authority for the following animals

Anselme Gatan Desmarest was a French zoologist and author He was the son of Nicolas Desmarest

Desmarest published Histoire Naturelle des Tangaras des Manakins et des Todiers Considrations gnrales sur la classe des crustacs Mammalogie ou description des espces des Mammifres Paris Veuve Agasse and Dictionnaire des Sciences Naturelles His son Eugne Anselme Sbastien Lon Desmarest was also a zoologist

Nicolas Desmarest was a French geologist

Desmarest was born at Soulaines in the department of Aube in France He was educated at the college of the Oratorians of Troyes and Paris While doing this he earned money by teaching to pay for his education 

Buffons Theory of the Earth interested him and in 1753 he won a prize by writing an essay on the ancient connection between England and France A lot of people were interested in this He was given job studying and reporting on manufacturing in different countries In 1788 he became inspector general of the industries of France

Demarest travelled around on foot to learn more about the Earths structure In 1763 he noticed that the basalt rocks in in Auvergne were old lava streams He noticed that they were similar to the columns of the Giants Causeway in Ireland He knew that they were evidence of the operations of old volcanoes which were no longer active 

In 1774 he published an essay on the subject after visiting the area a few times He then discussed the changes that the rocks had gone through because of weathering and erosion This was the first time that anyone had talked about valleys being made because streams which flowed through them eroding the rocks

He died in Paris in 1815 In 1823 his son Anselme Gatan Desmarest published a new and better edition of his map

Eugne Anselme Sbastien Lon Desmarest was a French zoologist and entomologist He was the son of Anselme Gatan Desmarest

Partial list

A clergyman is an ordained minister of the Anglican Church or of some other Protestant churches Vicar and pastor are other possibilities Rector is used in some Scottish Presbyterian churches The clergy is often used as a group term The word cleric meaning a clerk is the root term It comes from the fact that all clerics could read and write at a time when this was a rare skill

By general use and convention Anglican ministers are not called priests This is because the unqualified term priest or father is widely used as referring to the Catholic Church Of course in modern times an Anglican minister may be female in which case the term reverend or minister may be used

Endemism is an ecological word meaning that a plant or animal lives only in a particular location such as a specific island habitat type nation or other defined zone For example many species of lemur are endemic to the island of Madagascar 

There are two types of endemism  paleoendemism and neoendemism Paleoendemism means that a species used to live in a large area but now lives only in a smaller area Neoendemism means that a species has recently appeared which is closely related to the main species or one that has formed following hybridization and is now classified as a separate species This is a common process in plants especially those which exhibit polyploidy

The opposite of endemism is cosmopolitan distribution

Endemic types are most likely to develop on islands because they are isolated This includes remote island groups like the Hawaiian Islands the Galpagos Islands and Socotra Endemism can also occur in areas which are separated from other similar areas like the highlands of Ethiopia or large bodies of water like Lake Baikal

Endemics can easily become endangered or extinct because of only living in a small area They are also vulnerable to the actions of man including the introduction of new organisms There were millions of both Bermuda Petrels and Bermuda cedars in Bermuda when it was settled at the start of the 17th century By the end of the century the petrels were thought to be extinct Cedars whose numbers were low as a result of centuries of shipbuilding were nearly made extinction in the 20th Century by the introduction of a parasite Both petrels and cedars are very rare today as are other species endemic or native to Bermuda

Endemic organisms are not the same as indigenous organisms a species that is indigenous to somewhere may be native to other locations as well An introduced species also known as a naturalized or exotic species is an organism that is not indigenous to a given place or area 

According to the World Wildlife Fund the following ecoregions have the highest percentage of endemic plants

Some of the principal threats to these special ecosystems are

Michael Rogers Oldfield Thomas FRS was a British zoologist

Thomas worked at the Natural History Museum in their mammals department He described about 2000 new species and sub species for the first time He was given a job in the Museum Secretarys office in 1876 In 1878 he moved to the Zoological Department In 1891 Thomas married a woman who was an heiress to a large amount of money Having this money allowed him to hire mammal collectors and to give their specimens to the museum In 1896 when William Henry Flower took control of the Department he hired Richard Lydekker to rearrange the exhibitions This gave Thomas the time to concentrate on these new specimens He committed suicide in 1929 when he was 71 years old This was not long after the death of his wife

Leithiinae is a subfamily of dormice

The Twin Paradox shows how time changes because of speed and mass The faster someone or something moves or the more mass they have then the slower time passes for them This is shown by a pair of twins who are born at the same time Let us name the first twin as T1 and the second twin as T2 We place T1 in a rocket which travels at the speed of light while the other twin stays back on the earth On his return T2 finds out that his brotherT1 is younger than he is But as for the twin T1 he finds out that his brotherT2is older

The centriole is a cytoplasmic structure in most eukaryote cells It is involved in cell division and in the formation of cilia and flagella Centrioles are not found in vascular plants and in most fungi

A pair of centrioles arranged parallelly and surrounded by a mass of dense material constitutes the compound structure known as the centrosome

Imagebiological cellsvgthumb230pxDiagram of typical animal cell showing subcellular components Organelles nucleolus nucleus ribosomes vesicle rough endoplasmic reticulum Golgi apparatus Cytoskeleton smooth ER mitochondria vacuole cytoplasm lysosome centrioles within centrosome

In cell biology the centrosome is an organelle that is the main place where cell microtubules get organised They occur only in animal cells Also it regulates the cell division cycle the stages which lead up to cell division 

The centrosome was discovered by Edouard Van Beneden in 1883 and was described and named in 1888 by Theodor Boveri 

The centrosome has apparently only evolved in metazoan eukaryotic cells Fungi and plants use other structures to organize their microtubules Although the centrosome has a key role in efficient mitosis in animal cells it is not necessary

Centrosomes are composed of two centrioles at right angles surrounded by a shapeless mass of protein

The centrosome is copied only once per cell cycle so that each daughter cell inherits one centrosome containing two centrioles The centrosome replicates during the interphase of the cell cycle During the prophase of mitosis the centrosomes migrate to opposite poles of the cell The mitotic spindle then forms between the two centrosomes Upon division each daughter cell receives one centrosome 

Interestingly centrosomes are not required for the progression of mitosis When the centrosomes are irradiated by a laser mitosis proceeds with a normal spindle In the absence of the centrosome the microtubules of the spindle are focused by motors allowing the formation of a bipolar spindle Many cells can completely undergo interphase without centrosomes

Although centrosomes are not required for mitosis or survival of the cell they are required for survival of the organism Cells without centrosomes lack certain microtubules With centrosome the cell division is much more accurate and efficient Some cell types arrest in the following cell cycle when centrosomes are absent but this is doesnt happen always

A vesicle is a bubble of liquid within a cell More technically a vesicle is a small intracellular membrane enclosed sac that stores or transports substances within a cell Vesicles form naturally because of the properties of lipid membranes Vesicles can fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents outside the cell Vesicles can also fuse with other organelles within the cell 

The Forest Dormouse is a species of rodent in the Gliridae family found throughout much of Eurasia

The cytoskeleton is present in all cells It keeps cell shape protects the cell enables cells to move It helps transport inside the cytoplasm and in cell division The concept and the term was introduced by French embryologist Paul Wintrebert in 1931

Eukaryote cells contain three main kinds of cytoskeletal filaments which are microfilaments intermediate filaments and microtubules They give the cell structure and shape Cytoskeletal elements interact closely and often with cell membranes 

The Chinese Dormouse or Sichuan Dormouse is a species of dormouse that lives in sub alpine mixed forests in northern Sichuan China 

Only two two female specimens have even been caught These were both caught in the Wanglang Natural Reserve and was first described by Wang Youzhi in 1985 Corbet and Hill relisted it under a new genus as Chaetocauda sichuanensis It is the only member of the genus Chaetocauda

The two specimens had the following measurements

Cjaetocauda is nocturnal and arboreal It nests in trees about convert3mft above the ground and the two specimens were found at an altitude of more than convert2500mft above sea level It is classified as endangered by the IUCN as of the 2004 Red List due to its small isolated habitat

Dryomys niethammeri

The forest dormice genus Dryomys are a genus of dormouse found throughout much of Eurasia They are usually found in forests or thickets 

The length of the head and body is convert8 13cmabbron and the length of the tail is convert6 11cmabbron The animals weigh convert18 36gabbron

These dormice hibernate in tree hollows or in burrows At night they nest in low branches or shrubs They spend most of their lives in trees They are nocturnal animals 

They are omnivorous feeding on seeds acorns buds invertebrates eggs and baby birds 

Forest dormice in southern areas breed from March to December Forest dormice in northern areas breed from May to August Gestation takes 21 30 days and 2 5 young are born at a time

Eliomys is a genus of rodent in the Gliridae family It contains the following species

The garden dormouse is a rodent in the dormouse family

Garden Dormice are usually convert10to15cmabbron in length with the tail adding another convert8to145cmabbron It weighs convert60to140gabbron The coat is gray or brown and it is white wiktunderneath The garden dormouse has black eye marks large ears short hair and a white tassel at the end of the tail

The garden dormouses main habitat is the forest though it can also be found in fruit growing regions It is very common in southern Europe but its range goes up to the north of Europe Garden dormice are often found in the Alps in the Bavaria Forest and in the Ore Mountains 

The species can also be found in northern Germany but the population there is low In the Netherlands it is nearly extinct In 2007 only nine animals were found in two woods in Limburg It used to be very common in this area Scientists think that his is because the landscape has changed They also think that climate change might be a reason because it interrupts the Dormices hibernation

Garden dormice are mostly nocturnal They sleep in spherical nests in trees during the day At night they look for food like larger insects snails eggs baby birds small mice and spiders They also eat berries fruit and nuts While omnivorous the diet of dormice contains a bit more animal protein than vegetation

The mating period is from April to June To show that she is ready for mating the female squeaks loudly The babies are usually born in litters of three to seven after a gestation period of 23 days The babies are blind and have no fur when they are born They open their eyes after about eighteen days They are nursed until they are one month old When they are two months old they live on their own They become ready to mate when they are a year old They will normally live for about five years

Male Garden dormice may eat a rival dormouse during the mating season Cannibalism sometimes happens when the animal is coming out of hibernation

On the islands of the Mediterranean Sea there are a few subspecies of garden dormouse They are all very hard to find These subspecies are

The Garden dormice in western Asia and north Africa have been separated into their own species Eliomys melanurus

FileChromosomesvgthumbright220pxChromosomal components Chromatid Centromere Short arm Long arm

The centromere is a special region of a chromosome usually near the middle It is where the two identical sister chromatids stay in contact as the chromosome attaches to the spindle in mitosis The region contains specific types of DNA which are tandem repetitive sequences These sequences bind specific proteins called cen proteins 

During mitosis the centromeres can be seen during the metaphase stage as a constriction at the chromosome At this centromeric constriction the two halves of the chromosome the sister chromatids are held together until late metaphase

The phrase Grand Cross is used to describe the highest grade in many types of knighthood Sometimes the person with the highest grade are called knights grand cross or just grand crosses Sometimes the actual medallion or ribbon is called the grand cross and not the person

In some orders the highest grade may be called the grand cordon grand collar or something like this In those cases the rank of grand cross may come after another rank but before the highest grade

Rhizobia are soil bacteria which become established inside root nodules of legumes 

They fix nitrogen in a form the plant can use Rhizobia require a plant host they cannot independently fix nitrogen 

The relationship is a classic example of symbiosis and mutualism

Paul Steinitz was an English conductor and organist He was one of the first musicians in the 20th century to make a careful study of the way that music by Johann Sebastian Bach should be performed so that it would sound like it used to in Bachs day in the early 18th century He started a choir called the London Bach Society and a group of instrumentalists called the Steinitz Bach Players He conducted them in lots of concerts During the space of 25 years he performed all the cantatas of JS Bach in London There are over 200 of them

Paul Steinitz was born in Chichester West Sussex in the south of England in 1909 His father was an Anglican clergyman He became a student at the Royal Academy of Music studying under George Oldroyd He was a very good organist and got his FRCO diploma in 1930 In the 1930s he was Director of Music at the church of St Marys Ashford Kent There he became very interested in the music of Bach while studying for his Doctorate 

In 1946 he started the London Bach Society Then he became Director of Music and organist at the Priory Church of St Bartholomew the Great in London which was a very old church a lecturer at University of London and a Professor at the Royal Academy of Music

When Paul Steinitz founded the London Bach Society he wanted them to perform Bachs music Most musicians in those days played Bach in an exaggerated romantic style using large choirs and orchestras playing with lots of vibrato and with lots of changes of speed which Bach would not have done Steinitz wanted to show people how Bachs works should sound From 1950 he performed them in German When more musicians started to learn how to play period instruments he started to use these In 1952 he conducted the first performance in Britain of Bachs St Matthew Passion in its complete and original German form It was all part of a movement which was known as Back to Bach in its original form

In 1958 he started to perform all the 208 Bach cantatas that are known He finished this project in 1987 shortly before he died He got together a group of players which he called the Steinitz Bach Players They were professional musicians who agreed with what Steinitz was trying to do Every Lent they performed one of the two great Bach passions the St Matthew Passion or sometimes the St John Passion He took the choir and his orchestra on tour to the USA Israel German Democratic Republic and Bulgaria

Steinitz did not just perform Bachs music He conducted music by many Baroque composers as well as modern composers such as Igor Stravinsky Peter Maxwell Davies John Tavener Stanley Glasser and his own pupil Nicholas Maw

Steinitz wrote a lot about music He wrote a chapter on 18th century German church music in The New Oxford History of Music he wrote several books to show students how to write harmony and books on how to perform Bachs music called Bachs Passions Bach for Choirs and Performing Bachs Vocal Music

Paul Steinitz had many honours He was a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music and Royal College of Organists He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1985 the year in which Bachs 300th birthday was celebrated

At the end of his concerts when the audience applauded he would often hold up a picture of Bach so that the audience was thanking Bach for his music

Dr Steinitz died in April 1988 at home in his lovely 18th century cottage in Old Oxted just south of London He was a Quaker who believed strongly that music could help to bring peace in the world

There is a public memorial to him in the Cloister of St Bartholomew the Great West Smithfield London

Today Steinitz wife Margaret continues her husbands work with the London Bach Society of which Steinitz Bach Players is an integral part To reflect modern Bach scholarship and continue Dr Steinitzs work along the lines he had planned the original choir was disbanded to make way for smaller professional choirs  more Bach in its original form She also founded an annual Bachfest in 1990 which is presented each autumn

The London Bach Society is a society devoted to performing the music of Johann Sebastian Bach

The London Bach Society was started in 1946 by Paul Steinitz because he wanted to perform Bach in a style which was like the way it sounded in Bachs time Bach lived from 1685 to 1750 By the 20th century a lot of things had changed in music Choirs and orchestras were much bigger and instruments were made differently Steinitz wanted to get back to the sort of sound that Bach would have known He started a choir called the London Bach Society so that they could give concerts of Bachs music making it sound much clearer than it did with huge romantic choirs

The choir was formed in 1947 The singers were good amateur singers Steinitz rehearsed them a lot until they were very good The London Bach Society gave many concerts of Bachs music as well as singing music by other Baroque composers such as Handel Telemann and Heinrich Schtz They also sang works by modern composers such as Stravinsky John Tavener and Nicholas Maw Between 1958 and 1987 the LBS choir performed all the cantatas by Bach which survive 208 of them are known Many others have been lost The choir performed one of Bachs passions every Lent usually the St Matthew Passion They also went on tour travelling to the USA Israel Bulgaria and twice to the German Democratic Republic where they sang at St Thomas Church Leipzig where Bach had been Director of Music

In 1968 Steinitz got a group of players together calling them the Steinitz Bach Players They were professional musicians who understood how to play Baroque music Gradually he was able to add more and more historical instruments to his concerts such as the naturalclarino trumpet oboe da caccia baroque flute and sackbuts By 1985 there were enough professional players of Baroque instruments in England for the LBS choir to be able to perform the St Matthew Passion with a complete orchestra of period instruments in Wells Cathedral and later in 1987 at Westminster Abbey

After Steinitzs death in 1989 there was no more choir but the society still continues Today they organize a festival of Bachs music every year called Bachfest

Rodgau is a city in the Offenbach Rural District in the state of Hesse Germany It is the largest city of the district by area and by population as well 

Rodgau is in the Rhine Main area 30 km southeast of Frankfurt am Main The whole area of the town is 6504 km2 large and it is 130 m above sea level It is a plain area with no hills

About 35 to 20 million years ago in the age of tertiary the whole region was lying under sea level At that time it was covered by an ocean which was warm and not very deep Lots of sediments sank to its bottom Then the region rose again and the water left leaving soil which is mostly sandy and poor 

The town consists out of 5 former independent villages On 1 January 1977 they were united and became the municipality of Rodgau On 15 September 1979 city rights were given to the municipality 

The former villages now urban districts are from north to south Weiskirchen Hainhausen Jgesheim Dudenhofen and Nieder Roden They all lie by a small creek the Rodau flowing through the city from south to north Rodgau got its name from this creek The ending gau means area or district Rod is a hint to the former landscape The German verb roden means cutting down trees to cultivate land Rod is also part of the name of Nieder Roden 

The neighbours of Rodgau are 

Rodgau has 43047 inhabitants Nearly 10 of the people living here are from foreign countries They come from 52 different nations 39 of the people are of catholic religion 255 are of protestant religion and 355 have another or no religion 

The climate of the town is mild with an average temperature of 105 C There is less rain than in other parts of Germany

Some local people are speaking a regional type of the German language with a certain tone and special words It is a Hessian dialect This language type is related to other dialects in the south of Germany In former times mostly every village had its own special dialect sometimes hard to understand for people of other parts of Germany Today the dialect speakers are a minority and the majority of them does not speak the real dialect They rather speak a kind of regular German with a certain pronunciation

The first settlements were build in the 8th century Later in the 12th and 13th century the names of the settlements were written down in documents During the times the villages belonged to different owners Because of the reformation the people of the village of Dudenhofen became protestant but all the others remained catholic This led to the situation that the Dudenhofen people married partners from nearby Babenhausen Dietzenbach and other protestant places but did not have relatives in the catholic Rodgau villages Around 1830 the settlements had a total population of about 4000 people In 1939 the amount of inhabitants was about 11500 It increased to about 34000 in 1970 and to about 45000 at the end of the 2000s 

Formerly the people in the Rodgau area were farmers and craftsmen but not tradesmen Every family had land to grow their food When the property was handed to the next generation it was divided within the children Therefore most families had only small farms and were poor With the industrial revolution the Rhine Main area got lots of factories and developed to a center for metal working and leather manufacturing also chemical engineering Many men got workmen and found a job in the factories and earned money This increased living conditions partly 

After world war II the Rhine Main area was one of the hot spots in Germany because of its central location and its traffic opportunities Many companies settled down because of the Rhine Main airport and the motorways connecting the region with all parts of Germany From the 1960s on the Rodgau villages were a huge development area especially in Nieder Roden and Jgesheim Lots of small and middle seized companies started or moved to the area giving jobs to the people Houses were built and people from other parts of Germany or from other countries came to the area for working and living The fields near the villages were needed for building and the prices for the land exploded in the 1970s All this increased the living conditions dramatically 

The growing villages formed an urban areal and in the late 1970s the municipality of Rodgau was shaped Since then the former villagers and the new residents slowly began to develop a Rodgau identity Most of the foreign people at first came from Italy Spain and Portugal later from Yugoslavia and Greece then from Turkey Often the male members came to earn money and send it to their family abroad In many cases the families moved to Germany later settled down and got German citizens bought houses or built one Only few went back to their home countries The children went to German schools and are nowadays regular members of the community

The administration of the formerly independent villages was centralized and the new city hall is in the central part of Rodgau Jgesheim There are citizen offices in every former village called Anlaufstelle to deal with minor affairs 

Head of the city is a mayor The parliament has 45 seats Last elections in 2006 had the following results

Rodgau is ruled by a center right alliance of CDU and FDP 

The city government and the mayor got problems because after the parliament elections three members of the CDU delegates left the CDU parliamentary group The following political trouble influenced the later mayor elections and led to a new mayor now from the SPD He will start in April 2010

The coat of arms was given to the city in 1978 It stands for the former villages and their religion From bottom left to top right runs a silvery band It is the picture of the creek Rodau The fife stars on the band are the picture of the fife villages lying by the creek 

Top left is the picture of a luther rose It is a religious symbol and it stands for the protestant religion of Dudenhofen Bottom right is a picture of a wheel This is not a religious symbol But it stands for the catholic religion of Weiskirchen Hainhausen Jgesheim and Nieder Roden 

Both pictures are standing for the former owners of the villages The rose stands for the Count of Hanau and later the Count of Darmstadt The wheel comes from the archbishop of Mainz The rose is on one side of the creek and the wheel is opposite to it on the other side of the creek This means that the villages had trouble and fights because of their different religion

The two main fields of Rodgau culture are the surrounding nature and the peoples clubs It is typically German that most of the people of Rodgau are a member of one or more of the clubs 

These associations have a focus on singing sports orchestra music socker breeding pet animals dancing and many other There are about 50 clubs in Rodgau where people come together and spend their free time The associations are an important part of the social life of the city especially for the people of the former villages partly to keep their villager identity The clubs are open to new members who like to share the focus and to develope social contacts 

Rodgau is surrounded by large forests On weekend many people go there for a walk or make trips by bicycle on the narrow lanes which are leading all through the woods Often there are places for doing sports or having a barbecue The facilities are kept kleen and in order by work departments of the city administration 

Because of the village history there are no theaters or museums in the city but there are well known ones in the cities nearby mostly in Frankfurt Offenbach and Darmstadt There are no famous buildings in Rodgau but some architecture typical for the region The old churches of the villages and the framework houses are worth to look at 

There are five protestant and six catholic churches in the city For the Muslim there are two mosques one in Nieder Roden and one in Jgesheim 

Rodgau has two cinemas many restaurants of different style bars and some dancefloors 

Once in the year in January and February the whole region is celebrating carnival the local name is Fasenacht or Fastnacht It is mostly a tradition of catholic areas The local names come from a period named Fastenzeit some weeks before Easter when one should do fasting The celebrations are always ending on Tuesday midnight and the fasting period starts on the following Wednesday named Aschermittwoch 

In autumn every village has a extra weekend to celebrate It is the memorial to the opening of their church The feasts are named Kirchweih or  in the local dialect  Kerb In former times great autumn fairs were held on that weekend and the people especially the young ones of the nearby places went to the feasts to meet each other in the village to have pleasure to dance together and make friends 

During late spring and summer many small feasts are celebrated on weekend mostly in the forests at the barbecue places They are arranged by the local clubs and associations even by the local political parties They are open to the public and people go there to socialize having a meal and drinking some beer 

The most special and expensive vegetable of the region is asparagus which loves the poor sandy soil It is gathered in May and June Because of the same reason the region has a lot of potato dishes Some of them are very special and only available on special occasions like the Bauernkeeskuche It is a sort of salty potato pie that is made with a bread dough

The traffic in Rodgau runs mostly individual by car A lot of people are working in nearby cities They have to drive to their jobs in Frankfurt Offenbach or other big places They use the motorway A3 running through the north of Rodgau 

East along the city runs the B45 from north to south a motorway like street connecting all the urban districts with the motorway A3 and the cities of Offenbach Frankfurt and Hanau to the north and Darmstadt to the south The suburban railway no 1 runs to Offenbach and since 2003 directly to Frankfurt A poor bus system connects the urban districts frequently Rodgau can be easyly reached by street from most other parts of Germany This was one reason for its fast development in the past 

The city has no own daily newspaper There are the Offenbach Post and the Frankfurter Rundschau both with additional pages about Rodgau The Offenbach Post supplement is named Rodgau Post It comes weekly on Thursday There are two weekly papers for free which are brought to every house The Rodgau Zeitung and the Brgerblatt The Dreieich Spiegel also comes to the houses for free and has a part with Rodgau things There is a quarterly city magazine mein rodgau with articles about people sports culture and life style 

Radio information comes by the radio station Hessischer Rundfunk on channel 1 to 4 You FM and hr info Other radio stations are Hit Radio FFH also Radio Primavera in the nearby bavarian city of Aschaffenburg 

Rodgau does not have a hospital The next clinic is about 7 km away in Seligenstadt The town is short with specialist doctors Patients often have to go to nearby cities if they want to see a doctor on special diseases for example a heart disease There is a medical emergency center in Dudenhofen to give fast help in case of a heart attack 

The city has many kindergartens and primary schools in each urban district There is a secondary school in Dudenhofen For colleges and universities the students have to go to the nearby cities 

The North Pacific Giant Octopus is a big cephalopod that is in the genus Enteroctopus It can be found in the coastal North Pacific usually at depths around 65 meters but they have also been recorded at much deeper depths and shallower too North Pacific Giant Octopi are the second biggest kind of octopus after the Seven arm Octopus Adults usually weigh around 15 kg with an arm span of up to 43 m The Mantle of the octopus is round in shape and holds most of its important organs They mostly eat crabs shrimp abalone fish and shellfish like scallops clams and mussels In aquariums they have been seen eating Spiny dogfish a type of shark 3 4 feet long Food is grabbed with its suckers and then crushed using its tough beak of chitin North Pacific Giant Octopus are eaten by Harbor Seals Sea Otters and Sperm Whales They usually live about 3 5 years in the wild 

Chuck Palahniuk is an American satire author He is well known for writing the award winning book Fight Club It was later made into a movie directed by David Fincher He lives in the state of Washington

Palahniuk started writing books when he was in his mid thirties His first book Insomnia If You Lived Here Youd Be Home Already was never made into a book because he didnt think the story was very good When he tried to write his next novel Invisible Monsters publishers did not like it because they thought it was too scary This made him work on his most famous book Fight Club He wrote it to try to scare the publisher even more for not publishing his book Palahniuk wrote this story in his spare time After first writing it as a short story Palahniuk made it longer into a full book which surprising to him was published

In 1999 a changed version of Invisible Monsters and his fourth novel Survivor were published This made Palahniuk a cult figure A few years later Palahniuk wrote his first New York Times bestseller Choke After that Palahniuks later books would mostly have the same success This success allowed him to travel and promote his books where he reads from new and upcoming books

The Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George is an order of chivalry It was started on 28 April 1818 by George Prince Regent who became King George IV of the United Kingdom It started when he was Prince Regent for his father King George III

It is named in honour of two military saints Saint Michael and Saint George

The Order includes three classes listed below from highest to lowest

It is used to honour people who have done important things for the Commonwealth or foreign nations

People are appointed to the Order rather than given it British Ambassadors to foreign nations are often appointed as KCMGs or CMGs For example the British Ambassador to the United States Sir David Manning was appointed a CMG when he worked for the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office 

After his appointment as British Ambassador to the United States he was promoted to a Knight Commander Often when the Queen visits a nation the British ambassador to that nation automatically becomes a Knight Commander of the Order and afterwards they may use the prefix Sir

It is the normal award for members of the FCO

The Orders motto is Auspicium melioris vi Its patron saints are Saint Michael the Archangel and Saint George One of its primary symbols is that of St Michael standing over Satan

The Order is the sixth most important in the British honours system after The Most Noble Order of the Garter The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle The Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick The Most Honourable Order of the Bath and The Most Exalted Order of the Star of India

The Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick has not been appointed since 1934 as the Republic of Ireland is no longer part of the United Kingdom The Most Exalted Order of the Star of India has not been used since Indias independence in 1947

The Order was started to remember the British protectorate over the Ionian Islands The Islands had come under British control in 1814 It was given its own constitution as the United States of the Ionian Islands in 1817

The order was to reward people who lived on their Ionian Islands and on Malta who worked for the King

The protectorate ended in 1864 and the Ionian Islands became a part of Greece

The reasons for being appointed to the Order were changed in 1868 Anyone who did important work in Queen Victorias government could be appointed After this change many Governors General and Governors were appointed to the Order

The British Sovereign is the Sovereign of the Order and appoints all other members of the Order The sovereign follow the advice of the Government

The next most senior member is the Grand Master The office used to be held by the Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands but now they are chosen by the Sovereign

Grand Masters include

The number of members originally in the Order included

Members of the Royal Family who are appointed to the Order are not counted as part of these limits and neither are foreigners appointed as honorary members

The Order has six officers

The Orders King of Arms is not a member of the College of Arms

The Usher of the Order is known as the Gentleman Usher of the Blue Rod He does not perform any duties related to the House of Lords unlike the Usher of the Order of the Garter

Members of the Order wear decorated costumes on important occasions which vary by rank

The Sovereign will name some days collar days On these days members attending formal events may wear the Orders collar over their military uniform or evening wear When collars are worn the badge is hung from the collar

All collars which have been awarded since 1948 must be returned to the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood The other symbols can be kept

The original home of the Order was the Palace of St Michael and St George in Corfu This was the home of the Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands It was also the location of the Ionian Senate meetings

Since 1906 the Orders chapel has been in St Pauls Cathedral in London Religious services for the whole Order are held every four years New Knights and Dames Grand Cross are installed at these services

The Sovereign and the Knights and Dames Grand Cross have stalls in the choirs area of the chapel

Over their stall their heraldic devices are displayed The Knights helm decorated with a mantling and topped by his crest

Under English heraldic law women who are not monarchs do not bear helms or crests  this is because in the past women did not fight in wars or tournaments so they did not have a helmet Instead of a helmet Dames will have a coronet The exact design will depend on how important the Dames is in society

Above the crest or coronet hangs the Knight or Dames heraldic banner showing the coat of arms At the back of the stall there is a piece of brass displaying its occupants name arms and date of admission into the Order Upon the death of a Knight the banner helm mantling and crest are taken down The stall plates are not removed but remain permanently placed somewhere in the stall so that the stalls of the chapel are covered with a colourful record of the Orders Knights and Dames Grand Cross since 1906

The reredos within the chapel were designed by Henry Poole in 1927

Members of the Order of St Michael are assigned positions in the order of precedence Wives of male members are also given positions in the order of precedence So are sons daughters and daughters in law of Knights Grand Cross and Knights Commanders Relatives of female members are not assigned any special precedence 

Knights Grand Cross and Knights Commanders use the title Sir before their given name and Dames Grand Cross and Dames Commanders use Dame For example John Smith and Jane Doe would be called Sir John Smith and Dame Jane Doe

Wives of Knights may use the title Lady before their to their surname but husbands of Dames have no title to put before their name

These titles are not used by peers and princes except when the names of peers are written out in their fullest forms Honorary members and clergymen do not receive the accolade or use the title

Knights and Dames Grand Cross use the post nominal GCMG Knights Commanders and Dames Commanders use KCMG and DCMG respectively Companions use CMG Examples are

Knights and Dames Grand Cross are also entitled to receive heraldic supporters These may be real or imaginary animals or human figures They may also surround their arms with the design of the circlet and the collar The circlet is shown either outside or on top of the collar

Knights and Dames Commanders and Companions may display the circlet around their arms The badge is depicted hanging from the collar or circlet

In the satirical British television programme Yes Minister Jim Hacker MP is told an old joke by his Private Secretary Bernard Woolley about what the different post nominals mean

Hacker What does GCMG stand for

Ian Flemings spy James Bond was appointed to the CMG in 1953 He was offered the KCMG in The Man with the Golden Gun but he would not accept it as he did not wish to become a public figure

Sir Gilbert Thomas Carter KCMG was an administrative officer in the Royal Navy and later a colonial official who served as an Administrator and Governor in Africa and the Caribbean

Carter was the only son of Thomas Gilbert Carter who was a Commander in the British Royal Navy and Mary Webber daughter of Ezekiel and Sarah Gibbs Webber of Clyst St George Devon 1814 1887 Birth register of Clyst St George Vol 10 Page 182 1881 census gives evidence of Marys birth name and residence His sister was Mary Webber Carter 1847 1892 Head of a school for girls in Wincanton 

Carter joined the Royal Navy in 1864 working as an Assistant Clerk on different ships He also worked as a Clerk and as an Assistant Paymaster

In 1891 the native King of Gambia had been organising abusive acts towards the British colonists Carter sent an envoy from his official residence in Bathurst with a message that if the abuses continued he might expect a visit of a disciplinary nature from the marine forces of the Queen of England

The King sent the envoy back mutilated with a message This is the Kings answer In response Carter sent three British gunboats to get revenge for the bad treatment shown to the envoy

On 3 February 1891 Carter was appointed Governor and Commander in Chief of the Colony of Lagos In 1892 Carter ordered an attack on the Ijebu tribe in the interest of civilization Afterwards he continued to say that this attack was a war to end slavery and promote civilization

In early 1893 Carter travelled to various parts of Yorubaland accompanied by soldiers in an attempt to demonstrate the power of the British Some of the tribal chiefs did not want Carter there and told him not to interfere with the slavery trade

In January 1893 the Egba chiefs decided to sign a Treaty of Independence with the British Government The Crown agreed that Her Majestys Government would not try to take over any part of the Egba Nation without the permission of the lawful Authority of the nation

They also agreed that no aggressive actions should be made against the nation and that its independence would be recognised The Egba chiefs also promised to end human sacrifices

He was promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George on 3 June 1893 This was for the work that he did in Yoruba country and for bringing an end to a long war there

Carter sent works of art made by the Ife peoples of Yoruba to Europe

In 1898 Carter was moved to The Bahamas as the Governor and Commander in Chief He also had a temporary job as the Governor of Trinidad In July 1904 he was moved to Barbados as Governor and Commander in Chief

In the Spring of 1903 Carter met Gertrude Codman Parker She was travelling in the Bahamas with her parents Carter and Parker got married on 25 August 1903 in the Church of the Advent in Boston USA

He was married two times and had three sons and two daughters His son Humphrey was Director of the Cambridge University Botanic Garden

Carter retired in 1910 In 1919 he changed his surname to Gilbert Carter

In the early 1920s he moved back to Barbados and lived at Ilaro Court which had been designed and built by his wife

He died in Barbados on 18 January 1927

The uvula is the punchbag shaped object on the back of a throat in the middle of the soft palate Massaging the uvula causes the gag reflex which makes someone vomit

The uvula functions with the back of the throat the palate and air coming up from the lungs to create a number variety of different sounds Consonants involving sound from the uvula are not found in most dialects of English though they are found in many Semitic Caucasian and Turkic languages as well as several languages of Western Europe such as German French and a few Celtic languages where it is used to make a sound called the uvular trill

The history of origami started in Japan soon after paper was invented Paperfolding also had its own traditions in Asia and Europe and it is not known if they all came from the same place

Origami began in the 6th century when Buddhist monks took paper to Japan The first Japanese origami is from this time and was used for religious ceremonial purposes only because paper was expensive 

Canada Day is an official holiday in Canada celebrating its anniversary of Confederation It takes place annually on July 1st

A blood diamond also known as a conflict diamond is a diamond that came from an area which is controlled by armed groups which oppose the rules and regulations of governments These diamonds are mined by civilians who have been ordered by the armed groups to do so The diamonds are then sold and used to buy weapons to help the armed groups fight against the government Because of this most of the blood diamond mining happens in war zones

According to the Hebrew Bible Solomons Temple was the first temple the Israelites built for God It was also called the first temple and was first built by Solomon It stood next to the kings palace and was both Gods royal palace and Israels center of worship The Bible says that the Lord said to Solomon I have consecrated this templeby putting my Name there forever My eyes and my heart will always be there A symbol of holiness and royalty it reminded the Israelites that God was the special head of Israel It was patterned after the broken wikt linktabernacletabernacle and in general other temples at that time and was divided into three important areas the Most Holy Place the Holy Place and the outer courtyard It was built in Jerusalem on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite where Solomons father David had bought to build an altar to God

According to secular Historians the Temple would have been completed in around 960 BCE The Babylonians destroyed it in 587 or 586 BCE Rabbinic literature says that the temple stood for 410 years According to the work Seder Olam Rabbah written in the second century CE the temple was built in 832 BCE and destroyed in 433 BCE This is 165 later than the secular estimates

To date no definite archaeological proofs for Solomons Temple havw been found and the only information regarding the First Temple in Jerusalem is inside the biblical books of Joshua Judges 1 2 Samuel and 1 2 Kings

At first King David wanted to build a temple for God but according to the Bible God said to him through the prophet Nathan You are not to build a house for my Name because you are a warrior and have shed blood However he chose Solomon to build the temple Before his death David gave his son Solomon the plans for the building of the temple and instructions for the priests and Levites and all the work of serving in the temple He also gave his own money to Solomon to help build the temple and asked the people to help give gifts of money

King Solomon sent a message to Hiram king of Tyre who had been friends with his father David and sent David lots of wood to build his palace with In this message Solomon said that he wanted to build a temple for the Lord and asked Hiram to send him wood Hiram said that he would if Solomon gave food for the cost of the wood and work people did So Hiram gave Solomon all the cedar and pine logs he wanted and Solomon gave Hiram wheat for his family and twenty thousand baths of olive oil King Hiram cut down the wood and sent them on broken wikt linkraftrafts to a place called Joppa From there they could take the wood up to Jerusalem

According to the Bible In the 480th year after the Israelites had come out of Egypt in the fourth year of Solomons reign over Israel inthe second month he began to build the temple of the LORD King Solomon brought Huram Abi whose mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali and whose father was a man from Tyre and a person who was a craftsman in bronze Huram was very good at all kinds of work In 2 Chronicles 27 it says that he was skilled to work in gold and silver bronze and iron and in purple crimson and blue yarn He was especially good at working with bronze When all the work King Solomon had done for the temple was finished he brought in the things his father David had given to God and put them in the treasuries of the temple So In the eleventh year in the month of Bul the eighth month the temple was finished in all its details according to its specifications

When the temple was finished King Solomon brought the broken wikt linkarkark of the Lords covenant to the temple and made all the people of Israel come there and they sacrificed so many sheep and cattle they could not be recorded or counted Then the cloud filled the temple  just as God showed himself on the broken wikt linktabernacletabernacle at Mt Sinai he now showed himself at the temple in a cloud Then King Solomon praised God He said a prayer of dedication in front of the people of Israel He asked God to keep his promise to King David of letting King Davids sons rule forever then he added But will God really dwell on earth The heavens even the highest heaven cannot contain you How much less this temple I have built reminding the people that God was not bound to the temple and could not be contained even though he had chosen to come and broken wikt linkdwelldwell with the people of Israel in a special way Then he asked God to answer the people of Israel when they prayed toward or at the temple to hear from heaven when someone sinned or enemies came to Israel or there was drought or famine in the land whatever disaster or disease may come and when a prayer or plea is made by any of your people Israelthen hear from heaven your dwelling place Forgive and act deal with each man according to all he does since you know his heart so that they will fear you all the time they live in the land you gave our fathers Then Solom stood up and blessed the people of Israel and gave sacrifices to God twenty thousand cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the temple of the LORD

According to the Bible when Solomon had finished building the temple God appeared to him and said I have heard the prayer and plea you have made before meMy eyes and my heart will always be there at the temple you have made However God also warned to Solomon the importance of obeying Gods covenant in order to enjoy its blessings not its curses This was needed because God gave Solomon power and wealth which many times made people forget the promise God had made with them

Solomon also gave to Hiram king of Tyre 20 towns in Galilee because Hiram had given him all the cedar and pine and gold he had needed But Hiram did not like the towns Solomon had given him and he said What kind of towns are these you have given me my brother He called them the Land of Cabul Probably Solomon had become more indebted to Hiram than he had at first thought so he had given the towns to Hiram king of Tyre as a sign that he would pay him later 2 Chronicles 81 2 says that later when Solomon became richer  maybe because of the expedition to Ophir or the visit from the queen of Sheba

The temple of Solomon was next to the kings palace The floor plan was like most West Semite kinds of floor plans An early example of a floor divided into ulam hekal and debir has been found at Syrian Ebla and much later but more around the time of Solomon at Tell Tainat at the Orontes basin Like Solomons the later temple has three divisions has two columns at the entrance and is next to the royal palace

The ark of the covenant of God was put inside the inner sanctuary  the Most Holy Place  which was about 30 feet long wide and high overlaid with pure gold Solomon used lots of gold in the temple this was probably because the bright gold symbolized the glory of God and his heavenly temple Inside the temple were carved broken wikt linkcherubimcherubim palm trees and flowers This is a reminder of the Garden of Eden which humans could not live in anymore because of their sin The temple was a symbol that the Israelites could come back to paradise through the temple

Some discoveries today echo the words in 1 Kings 6 7

Something very much like the wheeled movable basin used in the courtyard of the temple has come from archaeological broken wikt linkexcavationexcavations on Cyprus 

A stone altar having four horns on the corners was found at Megiddo It shows a good idea of how the gold altar in the temple looked like The table for the Bread of the Presence was also made of gold The Bread of the Presence symbolized a continual offering to God by which Israel showed that she gave to God what she earned with her work and that everything Israel had received was a blessing of Gods

Ten lamp stands were in the temple five on each side of the broken wikt linksanctuarysanctuary Lamps like these have been found in many places in Palestine including Hazor and Dothan

Chromatin is the complex combination of DNA and proteins that makes up chromosomes It is found inside the nuclei of eukaryotic cells 

Chromatin is divided into heterochromatin and euchromatin forms The major components of chromatin are DNA and histone proteins although other proteins also occur The functions of chromatin are

Chromatin contains genetic material instructions to direct cell functions Changes in chromatin structure are one way the action of genes is controlled

Nucleosomes are the building blocks which make up chromosomes They consist of a segment of DNA wound around a histone protein core

First DNA and a protein make up chromatin Then the chromatin is packed up into nucleosomes Nucleosomes are then packaged up to make a chromosome The packages do three things the chromosomes function in cell division the very long DNA is wrapped up in a shorter package and the proteins regulate the gene action in cells

Nucleosomes form the basic repeating units of eukaryotic chromatin This packs the large eukaryotic genomes into the nucleus and allows it to be controlled

In mammalian cells about two metres of linear DNA have to be packed into a nucleus of roughly 10 m diameter Nucleosomes are folded in a series of higher order structures to form a chromosome This folding compacts the DNA and adds a layer of regulatory control The control ensures correct gene expression 

Nucleosomes are thought to carry epigenetically inherited information as modifications of their core histones This information can be passed on to daughter cells but it usually wiped out by meiosis in germ cells

The nucleosome hypothesis proposed by Don and Ada Olins and Roger Kornberg in 1974 was a big step for understanding eukaryotic gene expression Kornberg won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this and other discoveries

Although the nucleosome is a very stable protein DNA complex it is not static It undergoes some structural re arrangements such as nucleosome sliding and DNA site exposure Nucleosomes can inhibit or facilitate transcription 

Since they were discovered in the mid 1960s histone changes were thought to affect transcription

Some modifications have been shown to be correlated with gene silencing others seem to be correlated with gene activation The information stored in this way is considered epigenetic it is not coded in the DNA but is nevertheless inherited by daughter cells The maintenance of a particular state of a gene is often necessary for cellular differentiation

An extremophile is an organism that thrives in extreme conditions that are harmful to most life on Earth In contrast organisms from moderate temperature or neutral pH environments may be termed mesophiles or neutrophiles

In the 1980s and 1990s biologists found that microbial life has a capacity for surviving in extreme environments These are niches that are extreme in some way They may be extraordinarily hot or cold or dry or under immense pressures or very salty or acidic Such conditions are inhospitable to complex organisms Some scientists suggest that life may have begun on Earth in hydrothermal vents far below the ocean surface High temperature habitats such as hot oceans hot springs and deep ocean thermal vents would have occurred widely in the early Archaean eon Adaptation to these conditions may have been crucial to the development of early forms of life

Most known extremophiles are microbes The domain Archaea contains well known examples but extremophiles occur in bacteria as well It is a mistake to use the term extremophile for all archaeans as some are mesophilic Nor are all extremophiles unicellular protostome animals found in similar environments 

Some extremophiles fall under several categories For example organisms living inside hot rocks deep under Earths surface are both thermophilic and barophilic

Meowth has a cat like design with cream colored fur and has brown paws and tail tip It has whiskers black and brown ears and a gold coin on its head Meowth is spends most of the daytime sleeping and walks the city streets at night They put their claws back into their paws so they can move without noise and not leave footprints Meowth loves round objects as well as shiny things The item it loves collecting the most are coins since they are both round and shiny Meowth collects them and keeps them in its nest Murkrow a bird Pokmon also likes coins and steals them from Meowth

Meowth appears as a wild Pokmon in many versions of the games Meowth is one of the characters in the Pokmon Mystery Dungeon games Meowth is also seen in the Nintendo 64 game Pokmon Snap the Nintendo GameCube game Pokmon Channel and many others Meowth is seen in the Super Smash Bros series as a Pokmon used with a Pok Ball item and uses its move Pay Day and throws coins at players

Meowth has made an appearance in almost every episode in the anime because one is owned by Team Rocket agents Jessie and James the shows main antagonists He first lived in the city and tried to impress a female Meowth named Meowzie by learning to walk on two legs and speak human language Instead of being impressed she told him he was a freak so Meowth joined Team Rocket Meowth was cloned in Pokmon The First Movie but his clone could not talk or walk on two legs because Meowth needed to learn how to do this The Meowth clone is shown again in Pokmon Mewtwo Returns A trainer named Tyson owns a Meowth which beat Ashs Pikachu a the Hoenn Pokmon League This Meowth was dressed up like Puss in Boots

In the Pokmon Adventures manga Meowths first appearance is a cameo in the first chapter as one of the Pokmon that escapes from Professor Oaks Laboratory Meowth has appeared in the Pokmon Trading Card Game first in the Jungle series A special Meowth card was given when buying the Pokmon Trading Card Video Game In an open forum interview with ABC News Pokmon anime director Masakazu Kubo noted Meowth as his favorite Pokmon saying that while not a major Pokmon in the games a Meowth is in the anime

A fiddler crab also called a calling crab is a land crab that lives in mud or sand flats near the beach The reason this crab is called a fiddler crab is because it holds its large broken wikt linkchelipedcheliped in front of its body and moves it back and forth as if it is playing a fiddle

The male fiddler crab has one huge cheliped and another smaller cheliped Sometimes its the right cheliped thats the big one and sometimes its the left This huge cheliped is so large that it is sometimes bigger than the whole crab It is this cheliped they wave back and forth

The fiddler crab eats by first opening its mouth then using its maxillipeds it scoops in a small amount of mud or sand depending on where it lives Then it uses its other mouthparts to scrape any food matterit can from the dirt it has just put into its mouth After this it forms the mud or sand into a little broken wikt linkpelletpellet which is called a feeding pellet It then drops the feeding pellet and starts all over again

The reason the male fiddler crab has such a big claw is to attract females Every two weeks during the summer male fiddler crabs build little round broken wikt linkburrowburrows which are deeper and better than the ones they usually build The crabs guard these burrows broken wikt linkfiercefiercely Where there are lots of fiddler crabs there are usually hundreds of these little burrows all lined up only a few inches apart Each male fiddler crab stands out in front of his burrow waiting for the females to return from eating The females then walk around looking at the different burrows As they walk past the males wave their big chelipeds back and forth If a female likes a male or burrow she will stop and stare Then the male begins waving his cheliped wildly Sometimes the female will run away However if she stays the male will run between her and the burrow back and forth again and again If she has still not run away she will come closer to the burrow Then the male will enter the burrow a little and start drumming against the side of the tunnel with his cheliped If the female likes what she hears she will go down into the burrow and they will mate

That night the animals throw a massive party in the barn all the animals are there except Ben who watches over the fence which marks their space Otis is assigned his shift along with him but he talks himself out of it saying he is needed for a certain role in the party barn Ben talks with Otis and says the day he found him alone in the meadow the stars danced Otis is given the privilege to party out and the thankful son runs to the barn Later on Ben has to take on a pack of coyotes led by Dag which is raiding the chicken coop Ben manages to fight off the pack until he is bitten in the leg causing him to fall The coyotes pile on Ben but he manages to grab Dag and escapes the pile He threatens to punch Dag but lets him go scaring them off The hens cheer but Ben falls on the ground exhausted Etta the hen runs into the barn and tells Otis and the alerted son runs outside to his father Ben opens his mouth as if to say something but dies 

After Bens death all the animals elect Otis as the new leader of the Barnyard presumably because he is a born party animal He shirks his duties by leaving Freddy and Peck in charge of the coop and helping three trouble making cows in teaching a lesson to Snotty Boy who enjoys cow tipping Later that night when Otis is sitting with Daisy he overhears the coyotes chasing a hare Otis attempts to attack Dag but is outsmarted Since Otis is weaker Dag orders a deal that he and his pack will take animals here and there and if he tries to stand up for all of them they will kill everyone Otis decides to leave the barnyard realizing that he has no chance

The next morning before leaving Otis is informed that the coyotes took some hens and a chick Otis figures that he has been backstabbed by Dag as he was not expecting them until tonight and sets off to rescue the poultry Otis confronts the pack but is easily defeated however Pip Pig Freddy and Peck along with Miles the Mule arrive to help them along with the gophers and Jersey Cows Dag attempts to attack Otis from behind but Otis is alerted when Peck successfully manages to crow a warning Otis catches Dag and tells the coyote to never return Dag is swung out of the junkyard by Otiss golf skills

Otis and the rest make it back to the barnyard finding that Daisy went into labor She gives birth to a calf whom she names Ben Duke the farmers sheepdog asks Otis if he wants to stay and be their leader Otis agrees and everyone cheers as he walks outside finding the stars dancing The movie ends with Wild Mike dancing on top of Mrs Beadys head when she gets ready for bed

Robert J Lang is an American physicist known for his contributions to the art of origami

Lang started his career in origami forty years ago and many think he is now one of the worlds best paperfolders He travels often giving lectures about how origami is related to other topics like science mathematics and technology Lang is also the author of nine books and has written articles in several origami magazines He has found many uses of origami in real life situations like airbag design and an expandable space telescope 

Before being a professional origamist Lang had many different jobs He was a physicist engineer and research and development manager in chemistry Lang has helped to write 80 publications and has over 50 patents

Lang was born on May 4th 1961 in Dayton Ohio but he grew up outside Atlanta Georgia He was first introduced to origami when he was six years old Lang was very good at math and math class bored him so his teacher gave him an origami book to keep him entertained He quickly folded the models in the book and then folded models in many other books In his early teens Lang began folding his own models and he drew diagrams on how to make them

Lang went to college at Caltech The California Institute of Technology where he learned electrical engineering He found college very hard and often folded origami as a distraction from college life Lang was afraid to tell people about his hobby and he was even a little embarrassed about it For a long time Lang didnt know any other origamists He graduated from Caltech with a PhD in physics and later he graduated from Stanford University with a masters degree in electrical engineering

While in college Lang noticed the name and address of the Origami Center of America and he soon became friends with other experienced paperfolders including Michael LaFosse John Montroll Joseph Wu and Paul Jackson They inspired Lang with their pretty and complex models and he soon created new models he designed a hermit crab an ant a skunk and many other others Soon afterwards he took a trip to Germany where he was fascinated by their beautiful cuckoo clocks They inspired him to make origami clocks which impressed many paperfolders Soon after completing his first origami clock Lang began a job at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory

In 2000 Lang decided to quit his job and begin a career in origami

Lang has written nine books about origami

Lent in the Christian tradition is the period of nearly five weeks before Easter 

Lent is a time in which Christians are supposed to be quiet and thoughtful preparing themselves for Easter They should pray a lot give money to charities and give up some of the things they might otherwise do for pleasure The period of Lent ends at Easter which is a time of great celebration as the Christians think of how Jesus had died on the cross but then rose again from the dead

Lent is traditionally supposed to be forty days long because the Bible says that Jesus spent forty days in the wilderness in preparation for his death and resurrection

Lent begins on Ash Wednesday and finishes at the Ninth Hour of Holy Thursday or on Holy Saturday in the The Anglican Catholic Church

Churches in the Byzantine tradition count the days of Lent differently There are also different local traditions in the Oriental Orthodox church

Lent is traditionally a time for fasting This tradition was useful because it was a time when food which had been kept for the winter had to be eaten up before it went bad Many Roman Catholics do not eat meat other than fish on Fridays during Lent

The word lent came from the Anglo Saxon lencten meaning Spring The Dutch word for spring is Lente and the Old German word is Lenz

The 2010 Haiti earthquake was a magnitude 70 Mw earthquake centred near Logne about convert25kmmi west of Port au Prince the capital of Haiti It happened at 165310 local time on Tuesday 12 January 2010 The earthquake occurred at a depth of convert13kmmi The United States Geological Survey recorded a series of at least 33 aftershocks Fourteen of them had magnitudes between 50 and 59 Scientists predict these to continue for at least two weeks after the first event The International Red Cross estimated that about three million people were affected and the Haitian Interior Minister believes that up to 200000 have died as a result of the disaster exceeding earlier Red Cross estimates of 4500050000 Several prominent public figures are within the dead

The earthquake caused major damage to Port au Prince Most major landmarks were significantly damaged or destroyed including the Presidential Palace the National Assembly building the Port au Prince Cathedral and the main jail The current president of Haiti Ren Prval survived Most hospitals in the area were destroyed which makes the situation worse The United Nations reported that the headquarters of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti located in the capital had collapsed and that the Missions Chief Hdi Annabi his deputy and the acting police commissioner were confirmed dead Elisabeth Byrs of the UN called it the worst disaster the United Nations has experienced because the organizational structures of the UN in Haiti and the Haitian government were destroyed

Appeals for aid were issued by the International Red Cross the Salvation Army the United Nations and president Ren Prval Raymond Joseph Haitis ambassador to the United States and his nephew singer Wyclef Jean who was called upon by Prval to become a roving ambassador for Haiti have also pleaded for donations

Many countries have responded to the appeals and started fund raising efforts as well as sending search and rescue teams The nearby Dominican Republic was the first country to give aid to Haiti easing tensions that have existed between the two countries since the 19th century

Haiti is on the Caribbean plate and North America plate border which has been locked for about 200 years so huge stress had been built up and the energy was released in earthquake

The Octet rule is a general rule of thumb that applies to most atoms Basically it states that every atom wants to have eight valence electrons in its outermost electron shell 

According to the Bohr model an atom consists of a nucleus of protons and neutrons orbited by a number of electrons In an ordinary atom the number of electrons equals the number of protons If it has more or fewer electrons it is an ion In addition the electrons orbit in electron shells Each shell can only contain a certain number of electrons before new electrons must migrate to the next shell or energy level Starting with the third energy level however electrons sometimes move up a level even before the current one is full 

Every atom tries to have 8 electrons in its outermost shell This may require them to give up share or take electrons As stated above the number of electrons normally equals the number of protons This means that some atoms are happier than others For example neon as with other noble gases naturally has 8 valence electrons Not surprisingly neon hardly ever reacts with anything By contrast the atoms in the Alkaline metals column such as sodium have one valence electron with a layer containing 8 electrons in the shell below That means that if sodium only has to give up that one electron in order to complete the octet rule and does so if given the chance This is why sodium is so chemically reactive

Surfing is one of the tourist attractions particularly at Punta de Lobos According to travel guide Fodors

Every October and December the International Championship of Surf takes place at La Puntilla Beach Punta de Lobos hosts the Campeonato Nacional de Surf each summer

Pichilemu has many dark sand beaches The water is cool year round though many tourists choose to swim during the summer months Bodyboarding surfing windsurfing and kitesurfing can be practiced

The beach that is farthest north is San Antonio Beach or Main Beach which is found in front of the Ross Park It is known for good surfing

Las Terrazas Beach is the busiest beach during the summer Many surf schools La Ola Perfecta and Lobos del Pacfico are found near the beach as is the Caleta de Pescadores where fisherman sell their fish found at the south of the town and around the other side of the Puntilla the Infiernillo Beach is found It is used for fishing At the south of Infiernillo Playa Hermosa is found which is great for walking and fishing

Further south convert6kmlinkon from Pichilemu Punta de Lobos is found It is an increasingly popular destination for tourists and specially for surfers Several surf contests are held there including an international big wave contest during the Chilean fall The size of waves varies throughout the year but large swells in fall and winter can reach heights of up to 50 feet It is widely considered one of the best beaches for surfing worldwide

Babenhausen is a town in the Darmstadt Dieburg Rural District in the state of Hesse Germany 

Babenhausen is in the Rhine Main area 35 km south east of Frankfurt The whole area of the town is 6687 km2 large and it is 127 m above sea level It is a plain area with no hills

About 35 to 20 million years ago in the age of tertiary the whole region was lying under sea level At that time it was covered by an ocean which was warm and not very deep Lots of sediments sank to its bottom Then the region rose again and the water left leaving soil which is mostly sandy and poor 

The city consists out of the town Babenhausen and the 5 former independent villages Hergershausen Harpertshausen Harreshausen Sickenhofen and Langstadt 

The neighbours of Babenhausen are 

Babenhausen has 16066 inhabitants 

The climate of the town is mild There is less rain than in other parts of Germany

Some local people are speaking a regional type of the German language with a certain tone and special words It is a Hessian dialect spoken in the south of Hesse This language type is related to other dialects in the south of Germany In former times mostly every place had its own special dialect sometimes hard to understand for people of other parts of Germany Today the dialect speakers are a minority and the majority of them does not speak the real dialect They rather speak a kind of regular German with a certain pronunciation

Babenhausen and the former villages are early places where people lived In the time of the 7th to the 9th century new places to live got name endings like hausen and stadt But the names of the places were not written down 

In 1236 the name of Babenhausen was written down in a document for the first time About 50 years later it got the town privileges During the Thirty Years War the military made a lot of damages to the city Many people died because of diseases and hunger 

Formerly the people in the Babenhausen area were mostly farmers and craftsmen but not tradesmen Every family had land to grow their food When the property was handed to the next generation it was divided within the children Therefore most families had only small farms and were poor With the industrial revolution the Rhine Main area got lots of factories and developed to a center for metal working leather manufacturing and chemical processing Many men became workmen and found a job in the factories and earned money This increased living conditions partly 

In World War II Babenhausen was a central place for Russian soldiers who where caught in the fights with the German They lived here as war prisoners and had to work for the German people After World War II it became a central place for Jewish people that were prisoners of the NAZI concentration camps

Iron is the most common metal on Earth It is element 26 a transition metal in Group 8 Its symbol is Fe from the Latin word for iron ferrum Its atomic number is 26 and its mass number is 5585 

It is used a lot because it is very strong and cheap Iron is the main thing used to make steel As iron is magnetic it can be used to make a magnet

Iron is a grey silvery metal It is magnetic It is very strong which is why it is used Pure iron is malleable while steel is stronger The more carbon there is in the iron the stronger it is although too much carbon will make it brittle

Iron is quite reactive It reacts with most acids like sulfuric acid It makes ferrous sulfate when reacted with sulfuric acid This reaction with sulfuric acid is used to clean metal

Iron reacts with air and water to make rust The rust flakes off making more iron rust Eventually the whole piece of iron is rusted away Other metals like aluminum do not rust away Iron can be alloyed with chromium and carbon to produce stainless steel which does not rust under normal conditions

Iron powder can react with sulfur to make iron sulfide a hard black solid Iron also reacts with the halogens to make iron halides like iron chloride Iron reacts with the hydrohalic acids to make iron halides like iron chloride

Iron makes chemical compounds with other elements Normally the other element oxidizes iron Sometimes two electrons are taken and sometimes three Compounds where iron has two electrons taken are called ferrous compounds Compounds where iron has three electrons taken are called ferric compounds Ferrous compounds have iron in its 2 oxidation state Ferric compounds have iron in its 3 oxidation state Iron compounds can be black brown yellow green or purple

Ferrous compounds are weak reducing agents Many of them are green or blue The most common ferrous compound is ferrous sulfate

Ferric compounds are oxidizing agents Many of them are brown The most common ferric compound is ferric oxide the same thing as rust One reason why iron rusts is because ferric oxide is an oxidizing agent It oxidizes iron rusting it even under paint That is why if there is a small scratch in the paint the whole thing can rust

Iron is hardly ever found in the earth Sometimes rocks that fall from outer space have iron metal in them Normally hematite is in the ground The hematite is used to make iron metal

Some iron is found in meat Iron is also found in hemoglobin in blood Not all blood has hemoglobin in it though

Iron is made in large factories called ironworks by reducing hematite with carbon This happens in large containers called blast furnaces The blast furnace is filled with iron ore coke and limestone A very hot blast of air is blown in where it burns up the coke The extreme heat makes the carbon react with iron ore taking off the oxygen from iron oxides and making carbon dioxide There is normally some sand in with the iron The limestone which is made of calcium carbonate turns into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide when very hot The calcium oxide reacts with the sand to make a liquid called a slag This is drained leaving the iron The reaction will leave pure liquid iron on the bottom of the blast furnace where it can be shaped and hardened after cooling down Almost all ironworks are today part of steel mills and almost all iron is further processed into steel

There are many ways to work iron Iron can be hardened by heating a piece of metal and splashing it into cold water It can be softened by heating it and allowing it to slowly cool It can also be stamped by a heavy press It can be pulled into wires It can be rolled to make sheet metal

In the United States much of the iron was taken from the ground in Minnesota and then sent by ship to Indiana and Michigan where it was made into steel

Iron is used more than any other metal It is strong and cheap It is used to make buildings bridges nails screws pipes girders and towers Iron is magnetic so it is used in many magnets

Iron is used in bridges because it is very strong thats why its so hard to get out It is also very easy to get to There is a lot in the world so it is cheap

There are different types of iron Cast iron is iron made by the way described above in the article It is hard and brittle It is used to make things like storm drain covers manhole covers and engine blocks 

Steel is the most common form of iron Steels come in several forms Mild steel is steel with a little carbon It is soft and easily bent but it does not crack easily It is used for nails and wires Carbon steel is harder but more brittle It is used in tools There are other special types of steel Stainless steel does not rust Some other types of steel are very strong Other types are very hard

Wrought iron is easily shaped and used to make fences and chains

Some iron is very pure It just has iron in it This iron is very soft and easily made into a magnet It is made by electrolysis of iron chloride solution It is used in the core of an electromagnet

Iron compounds are used for several things Iron chloride is used to make water clean Iron chloride is also used Iron sulfate is used to reduce chromates in cement Some iron compounds are used in vitamins

Our bodies need iron to help oxygen get to our muscles because the molecule is at the heart of some essential macromolecules such as hemoglobin Many cereals have some added iron It is added to cereal in the form of tiny metal filings It is even possible to see the slivers sometimes by taking an extremely strong magnet and putting it into the box The magnet will attract these pieces of iron Eating these small metal shavings are not harmful to our body 

Iron is most available to the body when added to amino acids iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more digestible than than it is as an element Iron is also found in meat for example steak Iron provided by diet supplements is in the form of a chemical such as a sulphate which is cheap and is absorbed well The body will not take up more iron than it needs and it usually needs very little The iron in red blood cells is recycled by a system which breaks down old cells Loss of blood by injury or parasite infection may be more serious

Iron is toxic when large amounts are swallowed It can damage the body When too many vitamins that have iron in them are eaten people get sick There are chemicals that doctors have that can react with iron and stop it from poisoning people

Prime Ministers Questions is a weekly event in the British Parliament It is a chance for the Leader of the Opposition and other MPs to ask the Prime Minister questions Until 1997 there were two short PMQs each week Now there is one longer event which is on a Wednesday It can often be a loud and rowdy event with lots of people shouting Once Michael Heseltine grabbed the mace and waved it around his head

The Leader of the Opposition is the name given to the leader of the largest party not in government in a Westminster System of parliamentary government The Leader of the Opposition is often seen as the alternative Prime Minister Premier or Chief Minister They lead an alternative government known as the Shadow Cabinet or Opposition Front Bench

In many Commonwealth realms the full title is Leader of Her Majestys Loyal Opposition This is not used in Australia It is the duty of the Opposition party to ask questions to the Prime Minister or other ministers during Question Time

The following is a list of Leaders of the Opposition

The age of the Earth is over four billion years Working this out was a difficult problem to solve For most of human history the basic facts about the planet were unknown The problem was solved by Earth scientists in the twentieth century

The first facts about the Earth were worked out by the Ancient Greeks A good estimate of the Earths size was made by Eratosthenes using trigonometry The first estimate of the Earths age based on evidence was by Benot de Maillet a French diplomat philosopher and naturalist He thought the Earth must have developed by slow natural forces He studied geology in the field He could see signs of erosion on land and sedimentation in the sea He hid his ideas under the guise of a talk with an Indian philosopher to avoid conflict with the Catholic Church His work stayed in manuscript until after his death when it was published after its editor had made changes which damaged it Now there is a better modern edition based on the manuscripts de Maillet estimated that the Earth was older than two billion years He also recognized the true nature of fossils and had early ideas about evolution

In the last quarter of the 19th century there was a long running debate on the age of the Earth In Charles Lyells Principles of Geology he showed that the Earth had changed slowly and that what we see is the result of gradual changes This clearly meant that the Earth was ancient though Lyell did not try to work out how old His younger friend Charles Darwin believed this too Darwin saw that if evolution had taken place it would have required a long time Also a huge amount of sedimentary rock lies between the early fossils in the Cambrian strata and the present land surface Darwin and Lyell agreed that it would have taken a very long time for so much rock to be deposited

In the first edition of On the origin of species Darwin had estimated that the erosion of the Sussex Weald must have taken 300 million yearsp314 Both he and Lyle were surprised when the physicist William Thomson said the Earth could not be as old as they thought He made the calculation based on how long it must have taken the Earth to cool down to its present temperature given a starting point of 2000oC Kelvins result was based on the idea that the near surface geothermal gradient reflects the conductive cooling of the solid Earth

He did this calculation a number of times making various assumptions In 1862 his estimate was between 20 and 400 million years but in 1866 he reduced the top estimate to 100 million years and attacked Darwin and Lyle for not taking notice of his calculation We know Darwin was anxious and worried that this would not be long enough to allow for evolution Thomas Henry Huxley remarked that Kelvins calculations were good but his assumptions were wrong In 1897 Kelvin did the calculation one last time and came up with 20 to 40 million years This of course would definitely not be long enough to allow for evolution

Right at the end of the 19th century someone realised that if the mantle was a highly viscous fluid that would make a great difference to the calculations In 1895 John Perry a former assistant to Kelvin produced an age of Earth estimate of 2 to 3 billion years old using a model of a convective mantle and thin crust 

In Kelvins model heat on the Earths surface is derived from the cooling of a shallow outer crust assuming a solid Earth But if the conductivity inside the Earth were much higher than at the surface then the Earths core and lower mantle would also cool This would provide a huge store of energy to the surface In that case Kelvins estimate of the age of the Earth would be too low by many times

Perrys main reason was that convection in the fluid or partly fluid interior of the Earth would transfer heat much more effectively than would conduction

Kelvin stuck by his estimate of 100 million years and later reduced the estimate to about 20 million years

We now know that the existence of a viscous fluid under a thin crust is a much greater factor than the discovery of radioactivity which was the textbook explanation for many years The rediscovery and reexamination of Perrys work is quite recent

In 1896 Henri Bequerel discovered radioactivity In 1903 he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Pierre and Marie Curie in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by his discovery of spontaneous radioactivity

Eventually it was realized that radioactivity was a major source of heat inside the Earthp206 In 1921 came the first modern estimate using radiometric dating It was based on uranium lead dating the rate of decay of uranium to lead in the crust of the Earth by Henry Norris Russell He came up with 2 to 8 billion yearsp27 table 31 In 1949 HE Suess estimated 4 to 5 billion years based on a whole array of radioactive isotopes This is close to the time we estimate today which has been refined further to about 4560 million years 

The calculation makes use of convection in a viscous fluid as well as radioactivity so it combines Perrys idea with the effect of radioactivity even though Perrys contribution had been forgotten The later knowledge of plate tectonics made it quite certain that the lower mantle was a viscous fluid 

The formation and evolution of the Solar System is estimated to have begun 4568 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud Basically the whole system developed in the same period of time

Many societies assumed the Earth had always been as it is now Some religions raised the question of its age the Hindu religion got closest to the present day scientific estimate Some Christians and Jews believe the Genesis creation narrative is literally true which would mean that the Earth was created between 5000 and 10000 years ago However these days most people think such questions are best answered by scientific methods

Angara is a family of rockets which are being developed in Russia The family contains many different rockets For example there is a rocket for lifting small payloads and a rocket for lifting heavy payloads The rockets are designed by a company called Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center The first rocket is expected to be ready in 2012

Angara is being developed using money given by the Russian government The government decided to finance Angara because they wanted to make sure that Russia has independent access to space Many of Russias current rockets can only be launched from Baikonour Cosmodrome in Kazakshtan Many of them also use foreign technology However Angara is better since it does not use any foreign technology and can be launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome located in Russian territory Another reason why it was decided to build Angara is because Russia needed a rocket which does not use toxic fuels like some current rockets do

The first part of all Angara rockets consists of an engine called Universal Rocket Module The small version Angara 11 has only one URM while the heavier Angara 5 has 5 URMs For this reason Angara 5 can lift heavier payloads The second part of Angara 11 is called Briz KM and the second stage of Angara 5 is called Block I 

The rockets are meant for launching unmanned payloads such as satellites However Khrunichev has also suggested building a version that could launch humans into space Angara 5P 

All Angara versions can be launched from a single launch pad 

The first flight of Angara is expected to take place in 2012 from Plesetsk Cosmodrome In the future the flights on Angara rockets will be sold to other companies who want to get their satellites into space The price for an Angara 11 flight is expected to be about 20 million dollars

Samsara is a Buddhist term meaning the conditioned state of mind It is cycle of ignorance leading to disturbing emotions and clumsy actions They in turn are cause for suffering and new disturbing feelings and so on According to Buddhas teachings there are three main disturbing feelings ignorance anger and desire They are called three poisons of mind and are told to have 84 000 combinations The only way to completely get rid of suffering is to reach Nirvana or the perfect state of Buddha All the teachings Buddha gives lead to this goal 

There are six realms of samsara connected to six specific emotions

Elijah of Tishbe whose name means Yahweh is God was a prophet in Israel in the 9th century BC He appears in the Hebrew Bible Talmud Mishnah New Testament and the Quran He is best known for being Israels most famous prophet his brave challenge to Baals prophets on Mt Carmel and going up to heaven in a whirlwind

Elijah went to the king Ahab who rejected God because of his even more sinful wife Jezebel of Tyre who stood as a symbol of Israels unfaithfulness He went to Ahab and God said through his lips As the Lord the God of Israel lives whom I serve there will be neither dew nor rain in the next few years except at my word

Then Elijah followed the Lords command and went eastward and hid in the Kerith Ravine east of the Jordan He drank from the brook and God had ordered the ravens to feed him there 

The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening and he drank from the brook

But then the brook dried up because of so little rain and Elijah received the message from the Lord Go at once to Zarephath of Sidon and stay there I have commanded a widow in the place to supply you with food 

So Elijah went and met the widow gathering sticks to make the last meal for her son and herself 

But when he called her and requested her to get himself some jar in a water and bread she objected As surely as the Lord your God lives I dont have any bread  only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug I am gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son that we may eat it  and die 

Then Elijah said to the widow Dont be afraid Go home and do as you have said But first make a small cake of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me and then make something for yourself and your son For this is what the Lord the God of Israel says The jar of flour will not be used up nd the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the Lord gives rain on the land So the widow did as Elijah told her to do and there was enough food in the widows house for everybody

But then the son of the widow grew ill He finally after growing more and more worse stopped breathing 

The widow became so very worried and called Elijah What do you have against me man of God Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son 

And Elijah replied Give me your son He took him and carried him to the upper room where he was staying and laid him on his bed Then he cried out to the Lord O Lord my God have you brought tragedy also upon this widow I am staying with by causing her son to die Then he stretched himself upon the boy three times and cried out to the Lord O Lord my God let this boys life return to him And the boy returned to life making the woman admit that Elijah is a man of God and that the word of the Lord from your mouth is the truth a confession the Lords own people Israel had not made This is the first example of raising the dead in the Bible

Then Elijah went to present himself to Ahab as the Lord commanded him to and he met Obadiah the honorable man who had kept loyal to the Lord and had hidden 100 priests of God that King Ahab had tried to kill Obadiah recognized Elijah and respectfully bowed down to the ground exclaiming Is it really you my lord Elijah Elijah replied yes and ordered him to go and tell Ahab that he is here Obadiah refused crying What have I done you wrong that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be put to death and declaring how he had hid a hundred of the Lords prophets in two caves fifty in each and supplied them with food and water and that if Ahab came and saw that Elijah was gone and not here he would surely kill him

Elijah replied the more the calmly As the Lord Almighty lives whom I serve I will surely present myself to Ahab today So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him and Ahab went to meet Elijah They argued and Elijah told Ahab to summon the people from all over Israel to meet him on the Mount Carmel and to bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebels table And surprisingly Ahab obeyed him

Then when all the Israelis and prophets of Baal were summoned they prepared two altars  one for Elijah and for the Lord the God of Israel  and one for the priests of Baal Then Elijah went to the people and said How long will you waver between two opinions If the Lord is God follow him but if Baal is God follow him but the people did nor say anything so he continued I am the only one of the Lords prophets left but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets Get two bulls for us Let them choose one for themselves and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it Then you call on the name of your god and I will call on the name of the Lord The god who answers by fire he is the God

The people agreed to this and they did as Elijah said Then the priests of Baal all prepared the bull and called to Baal all morning till noon O Baal answer us but the so called Baal made no reply at all  and the prophets grew weary and discouraged Elijah however was pleased and he teased them Shout louder Surely he is a god Perhaps he is deep in thought or busy or traveling Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened So they shouted even louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears wildly as was their custom until the blood flowed from their wounds After midday passed it was Elijahs turn  and nobody paid attention to the Baal prophets anymore  so he prepared the sacrifice and ordered Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood And he said Do it again and they did it again and a third time as he said Then after there was so much water it ran down the trench he stepped forward and prayed O Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command Answer me O Lord answer me so these people will know that you O Lord are God and that you are turning their hearts back again

Then the fire of the Lord fell and burned up the sacrifice the wood the stones and the soil and also licked up the water in the trench All the people were awed and they fell prostrate and repented Then they all seized the prophets of Baal as Elijah had told them to and slaughtered them at Kishon Valley And Ahab went off to eat and drink as Elijah told him to Then after climbing the mountain of Carmel and asking his servant seven times if he saw anything above the ocean the servant answered him at the seventh time A cloud as small as a mans hand is rising from the sea And Elijah told his servant to inform Ahab to go home because a big rainstorm was coming Ahab rushed into his chariot and raced home but the Power of the Lord came upon Elijah and tucking his cloak into his belt he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel

After that Ahab told to Jezebel about what had happened about Elijah and how the prophets of Baal had been killed by the people of Israel Jezebel got angry and sent a message to Elijah that by this time of the day tomorrow she would make his life like that of one of them referring to the prophets of Baal 

Elijah became scared and ran away to Beersheba in Judah left his servant there and went ahead for a days journey in the desert Finally he came to a broom tree sat down under it and prayed that he might die I have had enough Lord he complained unhappily Take my life I am no better than my ancestors And he lay down and fell asleep But the Lord sent an angel to wake him up and feed him some water and a cake of bread baked over hot coals Elijah ate and drank and lay down again and the angel came back again and woke him and gave him more food Strengthened by that food Elijah got up and traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb the mountain of God There he went into a cave and spent the night 

And the Lord appeared to him and asked What are you doing here Elijah He replied not the answer to the Lords question but instead of how he had been very zealous for the Lord God Almighty and how the Israelites were being unfair to him The Lord told him to go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord Then the Lord sent a great and powerful wind and an earthquake a fire but the Lord was not in neither and finally he came in a gentle whisper and Elijah went out pulling his cloak over his face The Lord had tried to show him through all those winds and earthquakes and fires that the Lord was not always harsh but was more gentle The Lord asked once again What are you doing here Elijah but Elijah again ignored the question and complained about how he had been Zealous for the Lord God Almighty So the Lord told him to go anoint many new political and religious leaders and he did And he took Elisha for his next prophet and companion

After Ahab died Ahaziah was crowned king and he became ill So he sent some people to consult Baal Zebub the god of Ekron to see if he would recover However God was very angry and told Elijah to prophesy against Ahaziah So on the way Elijah went and met the servants and told them as the Lord had instructed him Go back to the king who sent you and tell him This is what the Lord saysIs it because there was no God in Israel that you are sending men to consult Baal Zebub the god of Ekron Therefore you will not leave the bed you are lying on You will certainly die And the messengers did has he was told At King Ahaziahs questions they described Elijah as a man with a garment of hair and with a leather belt around his waist Elijahs cloak was probably of sheepskin or camels hair like John the Baptists and showed a big difference from the other rich well dressed people at that time He was protesting against the selfishness of the king and the upper classes The king recognized Elijah by that description and sent a captain and fifty men to get him Maybe Ahaziah thought like many people at that time who did not believe in God that if he killed Elijah or forced him to change the curse it would not happen

The captain he sent said to Elijah who was sitting on the top of a hill Man of God the king says Come down Ahaziah was trying to place Elijah the prophet under his a kings power According to Israels covenant with God the king was supposed to be under the power of the word of the Lord spoken by his prophets

But Elijah did not come down instead said If I am a man of God may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men Then fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men With this Elijah was showing the king that in Israel a king was only a servant of the real king God Later Jesuss warning to his disciples when they were trying to call fire down to destroy the Samaritans was not to disapprove of what Elijah did but to show his disciples that the problem between Elijah and the king and the unfaithfulness of the Samaritans was very different

The king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men and they too were burned up by fire Finally the king sent a third captain with his fifty men who fell on his knees before Elijah and bowed before him humbly asking him to come Elijah was told by the angel of the Lord to go down so he went down and told the king again You will certainly die So he died according to the word of the Lord that Elijah had spoken

After that Elijah went to Elisha and they both went on their way from Gilgal Elijah said to Elisha Stay here the Lord has sent me to Bethel but Elijah insisted upon going so they went down together to Bethel 

The company of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and asked Do you know that the Lord is going to take your master from you today Elisha said that he knew but warned them not to speak of it Then Elijah said to him to stay there and that the Lord had sent him to the Jordan by himself but Elisha did not obey and insisted on going with Elijah Elijah then asked Tell me what can I do for you before I am taken from you and Elisha replied Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit Elijah then agreed but only if Elisha would see him be taken to heaven They were walking along when suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind Elisha cried My father My father The chariots and horsemen of Israel Elisha showed Elijah as a symbol of the true strength of Israel Elisha picked up Elijahs cloak and used it to divide the water in the river of Jordan so this cloak symbolized that Elisha had now taken Elijahs place

Isaac Watts was an English pastor preacher poet and hymn writer He is often called the Father of English Hymnody he was the first popular English hymn writer Because of his short height and large head in all his portraits Isaac Watts wore a large gown He wrote about 600 hymns including When I Survey the Wondrous Cross Am I a Soldier of the Cross and Joy to the World He is buried today in Bunhill Fields Cemetery London England

Isaac Watts was born in 1674 as a small and sickly child At this time his father was in prison for being a nonconformist preacher At that time in England a man who did not preach the way the leaders of the Church of England thought about God could go to prison Christians who were dissenters met secretly in fields and barns to hide from people who would report them Dissenters were fined for preaching anywhere if five or more people were there Isaac Watts gave much encouragement for people to continue to believe in Christ

Isaac even when he was young was good at and liked rhyming He was a good student and liked books Once when his mother said she would give a farthing to one of her husbands students who could make the best rhyme Isaac tried and made this couplet

I write not this for a farthing but to try

How I your farthing writers can outvie

When he was six he made some verses When his mother saw them she could hardly believe he had written them So Isaac gave his mother a poem he had made with his name

I am a vile polluted lump of earth

S o Ive continud ever since my birth

A lthough Jehovah grace does daily give me

A ssure this monster Satan will deceive me

C ome therefore Lord from Satans claws relieve me

W ash me in thy blood O Christ

A nd grace divine impart

T hen search and try the corners of my heart

T hat I in all things may be fit to do

S ervice to thee and sing thy praises too

When he was in his early tewnties Isaac saw a need in the church He told his father that the psalms sung in the church were rough and hard Isaacs father challenged him to write better songs and Isaac began writing hymns Watts produced many hymns for which he is now famous

Watts also saw that children needed to have hymns that suited their age hymns that they could sing in their everyday life Because of this in 1720 he wrote Divine and Moral Songs for the Use of Children These songs were about problems of youth at that time and still today with titles like Against Evil Company and Against Pride in Clothes 

Watts lived a long and full life preaching about Jesus teaching and writing books and hymns When he died his papers were given to Yale University

Some of Isaac Watts most well known and loved songs are

Invasion of the Bane is the first episode of The Sarah Jane Adventures which is a British science fiction television series about a woman called Sarah Jane Smith It was broadcast on 1st January 2007 and although it is written as a pilot episode it is not This is because a series was agreed before the pilot episode was actually written

In this episode a young girl called Maria Jackson discovers aliens When she discovers that an alien race called the Bane have created a drink that can control peoples minds she decides to team up with Sarah Jane Smith a journalist to stop them

This episode begins with Maria Jackson and her divorced father Alan Jackson moving into the house across the road from Sarah Jane Smith That night a bright light that is coming from Sarah Janes house wakes Maria up Maria decides to find out what it is and find that it is an alien called a Star Poet

The next morning her friend and neighbour Kelsey Hooper invites her to go to the Bubble Shock open day They hop onto the free Bubble Shock bus and get taken to the factory When they arrive a guard takes them to a security scanner The scanner takes their DNA and transfers it to the Archetype whilst being watched by Mrs Wormwood

Sarah Jane has overheard the girls plans and decides to follow them When she is the factory she interviews Mrs Wormwood She asks her how she gained approval of her drink so quickly and why she was not able to analyse Bane an ingredient only found in Bubble Shock Mrs Wormwood simply says that Bubble Shock satisfies the needs of the Western world She then throws Sarah Jane out Sarah Jane is almost killed by a secretary of Mrs Wormwood

Kelsey gets bored and walks out of the tour to phone her friend but disturbs the Bane Mother Mrs Wormwood tells her staff not to ring any sirens and to kill Sarah Jane Smith When Maria tries to phone Kelsey she sets off more alarms These alarms cause the Archetype to escape While Maria is escaping she bumps into the Archetpye and takes him to the safety of the womens bathroom He can only mimic her Sarah Jane then finds them and helps them to escape When they are at home Sarah Jane warns Maria not to keep following her because her life is too dangerous

Meanwhile the guards at the factory are speaking to Kelsey She complains about her treatment and to shut her up Mrs Wormwood reveals her true alien body She then finds out that Kelsey and Sarah Jane live on the same street and therefore tells her PR to take Kelsey home Maria then realises that the Bane know about Sarah Jane and the PR reveals his true body as well chasing Maria Sarah Jane and Kelsey into Sarah Janes house

After stopping the PR Sarah Jane takes the kids to her attic and tells them the truth She tells them that aliens exist and then years ago she met a wonderful man called The Doctor She travelled in Time and Space but then the adventures stopped and she was back on Earth She then told them that by accident she and The Doctor met again and she then found out that he still liked her

Sarah Jane Smith finally understands that the ingredient was sentient and rings up Mrs Wormwood and asks her to leave Earth But Mrs Wormwood refuses and uses Bubble Shock to control the majority of the human race Sarah Jane breaks into the factory immediately by driving the bus into the wall and the Bane Mother is revealed She explains that she made the Archetype with different peoples DNA and that the Archetype is the perfect human being The Archetype uses the Bane technology to rescue the gang and to explode the factory

Later on Sarah Jane agrees to adopt the Archetype and they decide to call him Luke because Sarah Jane said that if she ever had a son she would call it Luke The episode ends with Sarah Jane telling us that if we look hard enough we might just find aliens

The Acarina or Acari are the mites and ticks They are an order of Arachnids

Their fossil history goes back to the Devonian era Most acarines are tiny less than a millimetre It is estimated that over 50000 species have been described but a million or more species may be currently living The study of mites and ticks is called acarology

Acarines live in practically every habitat and include aquatic and terrestrial species They outnumber other arthropods in the soil and detritus Many are parasitic and they affect both vertebrates and invertebrates Most parasitic forms are external parasites while the free living forms are generally predators and may even be used to control undesirable arthropods Others help to break down forest litter and dead organic matter such as skin cells Others still are herbivorous and may damage crops Damage to crops is perhaps the most costly economic effect of mites especially by the spider mites and their relatives earth mites thread footed mites and the gall and rust mites 

Some parasitic forms affect humans and other mammals causing damage by their feeding and can even be vectors of diseases such as scrub typhus and rickettsia A well known effect of mites on humans is as an allergen which stimulates asthma Predatory mites may be used in pest control and herbivorous mites used to attack weeds A positive contribution of the Acari is their normal functioning in ecosystems especially their roles in the decomposer subsystem

A hugely successful group with a large number of species Mites are among the most diverse and successful of all the invertebrate groups They have exploited an incredible array of habitats and because of their small size go largely unnoticed Many live freely in the soil or water but there are also a large number of species that live as parasites on plants animals and some that feed on mould

Ticks are blood sucking ectoparasites mostly of mammals and birds They wait on grass or bushes and jump onto passing animals A number of birds specialise in picking them off larger animals the Cattle Egret and the Oxpecker for example They are quite serious pests and can be hard to get rid of They are vectors carrying diseases such as Lyme disease

Ahab or Achav or Achab in Douay Rheims was King of Israel and the son of Omri He is written about in the Books of Kings and the Books of Chronicles

Ahab son of Omri did more evil in the eyes of the LORD than any of those before him as it is written in the Bible Many think  and say  that it is probably because of his evil wife Queen Jezebel daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians She was even more sinful than Ahab and comes out in the Bible commanding Ahab to do most of the things she wants She serves the idol Baal and tries to make Ahab and all the Israelites worship it as well One of Ahabs most famous enemies is an old prophet named Elijah He continually rebukes Ahab for being so disobeying to the LORD and when Ahab summoned all the prophets of Baal against Elijah at Mount Carmel and set two altars for them Elijah won by calling on God and letting fire come and burn the sacrifice and the prophets of Baal were immediately killed by the Israelites Importantly even here Ahab does nothing either to stop or help Elijah

Once there was a quite well known war between Ben Hadad king of Aram and King Ahab Ben Hadad came and with thirty two kings with horses and chariots he attacked Samaria He said to King Ahab 

Your silver and gold are mine and the best of your wives and children are mine This King Ahab agreed with but after that Ben Hadad sent another more demanding command I sent to demand your silver and gold your wives and children But about this time tomorrow I am going to send my officials to search your palace and the houses of your officials They will seize everything you value and carry it away and King Ahab grew annoyed He rejected that command and so Ben Hadad decided to battle against Ahab And after that the LORD sent a prophet and said Do you see this vast army I will give it into your hand today and then you will know that I am the LORD And he also added that the young officers of the commanders will do it and that King Ahab would start the battle

Encouraged by this Ahab took the young officers of the comanders 232 men Then he assembled the rest of the Israelites 7000 in all They set out at noon while Ben Hadad and the 32 kings with him were in their tents getting drunk and defeated them all because God was with them 

After that later at spring as a prophet prophesied to Ahab Ben Hadad came again mustering all his army They came to the valleys declaring triumphantly that God was a gods of hills and that was why the Israelites were strong and now that they were in the valleys they would surely win the battle But God wanted to prove that he was the God of everything and not only of the hills so he helped Ahab defeat them there too Ahab then spared Ben Hadads life later causing God to get angry at Ahab and say through a prophet This is what the LORD says You have set free a man that I had determined should die Therefore it is your life for his life your people for his people 

Ahab also once did a great sin that the LORD was very angry at and it included a vineyard of Naboh the Jezreelite 

He wanted a vineyard belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite because it was in Jezreel and close to his palace So Ahab said to Naboth Let me have your vineyard to use for a vegetable garden since it is close to my palace In exchange I will give you a better vineyard or if you prefer I will pay you whatever it is worth But Naboth was unwilling because the LORD forbid that he should give Ahab the inheritance of his fathers So Ahab was very angry and sulky and when he was at home he wouldnt eat and pouted on his bed Then Jezebel came over and asked Why are you so broken wikt linksullensullen Why wont you eat And Ahab explained to her the situation Jezebeel told him to get up and said that she would get him the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite 

So she wrote some letters in Ahabs name placed his seal on them and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in Naboths city It said Proclaim a day of fasting and seat Naboth in a prominent place among the people But seat two scoundrels opposite him and have them testify that he has cursed both God and the king Then take him out and stone him to death 

So the elders and nobles did as she told him to and Naboth died a bitter meaningless death 

Then Jezebel declared to Ahab that Naboth was no longer alive but dead and Ahab got up and took possession of Nahabs vineyard The Lord was very angry at Ahab for this and said to Elijah the Tishbite a prophet Go down to meet Ahab the king of Israel who rules in Samaria He is now in Naboths vineyard where he has gone to take possession of it Say to him This is what the LORD says have you not murdered a man and seized his property Then say to him This is what the LORD says in the place where dogs licked up Naboths blood dogs will lick up your blood  yes yours King Ahab said to Elijah when he met him So you have found me my enemy Elijah replied I have found you because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of the LORD I am going to bring disaster on you I will consume your descendants and cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel  slave or free I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and that of Baasha son of Ahijah becauase you have provoked me to anger and have caused Israel to sin And also concerning Jezebel the LORD says Dogs will devour Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel Dogs will eat those belonging to Ahab who die in the city and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country At hearing this Ahab grew afraid and humbled himself by tearing his clothes putting on sackcloth and fasting He lay in sackcloth and went around meekly The LORD felt compassionate and said to Elijah Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before me Because he has humbled himself I will not bring this disaster in his day but I will bring it on his house in the days of his son

According to the Bible for three years there was no war between Aram and Israel But in the third year when Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to see Ahab Ahab said Lets go retake Ramoth Gilead from the king of Aram Will you go with me Jehoshaphat replied I am as you are my people as your people my horses as your horses For this he would later be broken wikt linkrebukerebuked by the prophet Jehu But he added First seek the counsel of the Lord

King Ahab called together the prophetsabout four hundred menand asked them Shall I go to attack Ramoth Gilead or not And they said Go These prophets were not really prophets but simply did their job by saying things that they thought would make the king happy  not what the Lord really said King Jehoshaphat saw that the 400 prophets were not to be trusted and asked to see a real prophet of the Lord saying Is there not a prophet of the Lord here King Ahab said that there was Micaiah son of Imlah but he never prophesies anything good about me but always bad Jehoshaphat wanted to see him so Ahab called him Meanwhile Zedekiah son of Kenaanah one of the 400 prophets had made iron horns and he cried This is what the Lord says With these you will broken wikt linkgoregore the Arameans until they are destroyed All the other prophets said the same thing Even the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah said to him Let your word agree with theirs

When Micaiah came he said Attack and be victorious But Ahab probably saw that Micaiah was not being serious and he said tell me nothing but the truth So Micaiah said that he saw the Lord sitting on his throne in heaven and that the Lord had put a lying spirit in the mouths of all the prophets because they did not love the truth and had chosen to speak out of their own hearts At this one of the prophets Zedekiah son of Kenaanah was so enraged he went to Micaiah and slapped him in the face saying sarcastically Which way did the spirit from the Lord go when he went from me to speak to you Micaiah replied You will find outwhen you go to hide in an inner room King Ahab put Micaiah and prison and went to battle in disguise thinking that this way nobody would know who he was and so Micaiahs prophecy would not be fulfilled But one of the soldiers shot him by mistake and he had a deep wound and died in his chariot watching the battle sadly As in the prophecy of Elijah the dogs licked up his blood After him his sons succeeded as king Ahaziah and Jehoram

Eppertshausen is a municipality in the Darmstadt Dieburg Rural District in the state of Hesse Germany 

Eppertshausen is located in the Rhine Main area 15 km northeast of Darmstadt The whole area of the village is 1311 km2 large and it lies 130 190 m above sea level It is a plain area with a few hills

About 35 to 20 million years ago in the age of tertiary the whole region was lying under sea level At that time it was covered by an ocean which was warm and not very deep Lots of sediments sank to its bottom Then the region rose again and the water left leaving soil which is mostly sandy and poor 

The neighbours of Eppertshausen are 

Eppertshausen has 5829 inhabitants 

The climate of the town is mild There is less rain than in other parts of Germany

Some local people are speaking a regional type of the German language with a certain tone and special words It is a Hessian dialect spoken in the south of Hesse This language type is related to other dialects in the south of Germany In former times mostly every place had its own special dialect sometimes hard to understand for people of other parts of Germany Today the dialect speakers are a minority and the majority of them does not speak the real dialect They rather speak a kind of regular German with a certain pronunciation

Eppertshausen is an early place where people lived In the time of the 7th to the 9th century new places to live got name endings like hausen

In a Hierarchical database model is a data model where the data is organised like a tree The structure allows repeating information using parentchild relationships each parent can have many children but each child only has one parent All attributes of a specific record are listed under an entity type

In a database an entity type is the equivalent of a table each individual record is represented as a row and an attribute as a column Entity types are related to each other using 1 N mapping also known as one to many relationships 

The most recognized and used hierarchical databases are IMS developed by IBM and Windows Registry by Microsoft

Alveoli are tiny air flaps in the lungs In the alveoli oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the blood getting rid of the carbon dioxide and giving the oxygen to the red blood cells to be delivered to all of the muscles and organs Alveoli are elastic which means that they can stretch when they are filled with air

Alveoli exchange oxygen with red blood cells when the hearts Sinoatrial and Atrioventricular nodes send electric signals to the hearts ventricles The right side of the heart then contracts twicefact sending blood shooting into the pulmonary circulatory system where capillary beds are located in the lungs The Alveoli then exchange oxygen and discard carbon dioxide with the red blood cells which then return to the hearts left atrium

The singular of alveoli is one alveolus Alveoli are tiny grape like sacs where gas exchange takes place in the lungs When you breathe out the body delivers carbon dioxide to the alveoli and you release it in your exhalation When you breathe in oxygen fills the alveoli and then enters the blood so it can be delivered to the rest of the body In asthma there is no damage to the alveoli which is different from another common lung disease which is called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in which alveoli are damaged A network of blood capillaries surround walls of each alveolusThe walls are extremely thinand moistthus allowing gaseous diffussion through them

Mohs scale of mineral hardness is named after the scientist Friedrich Mohs who invented a scale of hardness based on the ability of one mineral to scratch another Rocks are made up of one or more minerals According to the scale Talc is the softest it can be scratched by all other materials Gypsum is harder it can scratch talc but not calcite which is even harder The hardness of a mineral is mainly controlled by the strength of the bonding between the atoms and partly by the size of the atoms It is a measure of the resistance of the mineral to scratching

As it says in Mohs scale the diamond is always at the most top of the scale being the hardest mineral There are ten minerals in Mohs scale talc gypsum calcite fluorite apatite orthoclase quartz topaz corundum and for last and the hardest diamond But since the Mohs scale was made long ago it is not exactly correct  for example many have found and reported minerals higher in hardness than the diamond So the Mohs scale may not be most completely perfect but it is still quite trustworthy

Friedrich Mohs was a scientist who studied minerals and rocks a German minerologist

Scientist Mohs was born in Germany and he was a minerologist who studied minerals chemistry physics and mathematics He was born in 1773 January 29th and died in 1839 September 29

He moved to Austria in 1801 where he found a job identifying minerals in a collection that belonged to a rich banker He used physical characteristics of the crystals to decide what they were One of the characteristics he used to identify minerals was hardness 

He knew that some of the minerals could scratch others and that if a mineral could make a scratch on another it must be harder than the mineral that was scratched He found that all minerals could scratch the mineral talc so it must be very soft He also found that diamonds were so hard that no other minerals could scratch them 

About ten years later Friedrich made a scale from one to 10 to describe mineral hardness He gave harder minerals larger numbers and softer minerals smaller numbers Talc the softest mineral he assigned to one the smallest number on the scale Diamond the hardest mineral he assigned to 10 the largest number on the scale This scale was called Mohs scale of mineral hardness named after Friedrich Mohs

In 1812 Mohs became professor in Graz in 1818 professor in Freiberg Saxony in 1826 professor in ViennaIn 1817 Mohs replaced his mentor Werner who had died as a tutor at the mining academy in Freiberg where he worked for nine more years until he was appointed as a professor of Mineralogy at the University of Vienna

Mohs ended his remarkable career as a mining advisor at the Mining University in Leoban and died aged 66 while holidaying in Italy

Its scientific name is from the Greek drosos dew dewdrops Its English name is sundew from Latin ros solis meaning dew of the sun Both names describe the sweet smelling sticky broken wikt linkmucilagemucilage that comes down the ends of broken wikt linktentacletentacles on each flower broken wikt linkstalkstalk This mucilage rolls down the plant attracting sugar loving insects day and night The mucilage has enzymes which digests them so that the plants can get the nitrogen it needs from it Like all plants the sundew makes its own food and just uses insects for nitrogen and other nutrients These tiny flowering plants are about convert5inmm0lkonabbron tall about as tall as an adults hand though some climbing sundews can be much taller One species of sundew the Drosera erythrogyne grew up to convert30ftm0lkonabbron Sundew roots are not very strong They are usually simply for taking in water and keeping the sundew firmly planted to the ground

A fly butterfly or other nectar loving insect will find the sweet smell of the mucilage that oozes from the plant Landing on the colorful tip the insect will immediately be stuck The plant has cells that make more mucilage in the place where the insect is The gooey mucilage will completely broken wikt linksurroundsurround the insect Then the sundew plant wraps its outside tentacles around the insect absorbing its nutrients It curls its tentacles around the insect quite quickly in some species this takes only a few seconds Some species like Drosera glanduligera can curl its tentacles towards its prey in less than a second Many sundews can bend parts of themselves so that the prey will be as sticky as possible One species Drosera capensis actually wraps its leaf around the prey in 30 minutes as seen in the picture on the right The prey usually dies in about 15 minutes The sundew will then eat the entire insect except the outside exoskeleton When the plant has finished eating it opens up its tentacles and drops the exoskeleton to the ground

Some children are disabled or they have learning difficulties Special education is about teaching these children Some of them can be educated with other children of the same age who are not disabled Others must go to special schools If the disability is too bad they can not get an education Students who have emotional problems and act poorly are sometimes expelled from school

Special needs include speech or hearing difficulties emotional and behavioral disorders physical disabilities and developmental disorders Students with these special needs often get more educational services This may mean different approaches to teaching access to a resource room and use of technology

Some students are very smart These students are called gifted They also have certain needs so they can succeed These students do better with special teaching styles or different educational programs The word special education is used for students whose special needs stop them from learning the way normal people learn Gifted education is handled separately

Schools provide special education services to special students 

Most schools around the world use inclusion which means children with special needs need to earn their right to be in the regular classroom Sometimes schools may use full inclusion for certain students such as those with mental retardation In that case this is where social tolerance is afforded rather than if these students actually do earn their right to be in regular classroom Sometimes mainstreaming is used this is when children with special needs are in regular classroom settings as much as possible and put in special classes for the rest of the day Social integration is used for students with special needs who are in a resource room or other special class for the rest of the time

Historically most students with special needs have been excluded from school and such exclusion may still occur where there is no legal mandate for special education services such as in developing countries

The Sooty Barbthroat is a species of hummingbird It is found in French Guiana and far north eastern Brazil Its habitat is humid tropical lowland forest Though normally restricted in range it is common enough to be thought a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN

The taxonomy and systematics of the Sooty Barbthroat complex has made much confusion Some authors thought the Sooty Barbthroat to be a melanistic variant of the Pale tailed Barbthroat

Not only that but some suggest that the Bronze tailed Barbthroat should also be thought a valid species and have the doubtful Christinas Barbthroat as a subspecies Freires Sooty Barbthroat is average between the Sooty and Bronze tailed Barbthroats however and thus its status needs to be more clear before the problem is fixed

The Airbus A330 is a two engine wide body passenger aeroplane made by Airbus It was designed at the same time as the Airbus A340 so it has the same body and wings

It first flew in 1992 and the first one was given to Air Inter in 1994 It was a 300 series Just after this Airbus made the shorter 200 series Now Airbus has made a freighter version and a tanker version 

There are also 394 A330s that need to be made and given to airlines Most of these are the smaller 200 series version

Airlines wanted a new aeroplane to replace their McDonnell Douglas DC 10 aeroplanes which were getting old So Airbus started a new project in November 1987 the A330 and A340 programs In the end it was found that the A330 is almost 38 more fuel efficient than the DC 10

Airbus designed the A330 to be in the market for ETOPS aeroplanes This market already had planes like the Boeing 767 In November 2009 the A330 was the first aeroplane to get the ETOPS 240 approval which means that the plane is allowed to fly up to 240 minutes away from any airport This means it can fly over large oceans or places like the Antarctic where there are no airports nearby 

The A330s broken wikt linkfuselagebody and wings are nearly exactly the same as the smaller versions of the A340s wings and body but they have different engines The A330s body is also similar to the older Airbus A300 and the computers and systems are similar to the Airbus A320 family of aeroplanes Also both the A330 and A340 are built at the same place Toulouse Blagnac Airport in Toulouse in France

The 1000th A330 was ordered at the 2008 Farnborough Air Show

Airbus thinks that it will keep building the A330 until at least 2015

There are two main types of Airbus A330 the 200 series and the 300 series There is also the freighter version which carries cargo instead of people and the tanker version which carries lots of fuel

The A330 200 was made to compete with Boeings 767 300ER It is a shorter version of the A330 300 and is like the A340 200

In the 1990s Airbus was not selling very many A340 200s So Airbus used the body of the A340 200 and took the wings and engines of the A330 300 This made the plane much more efficient and the A330 200 was much more popular than the A340 200

The tail fin of the A330 200 is a little bit taller than the 300 version to produce the same torque as the A330 300

It has the same MTOW as the A330 300 so it can take more fuel than the A330 300 This means the A330 200 can fly further than the A330 300 It has a range of 12500 km which is the same as 6750 nmi

It has two engines either two General Electric CF6 80E engines two Pratt Whitney PW4000 engines or two Rolls Royce Trent 700 engines

In May 2009 Airbus said they have plans to make a version of the A330 200 that can take off with a higher weight This is because they want to compete with Boeing and their 787 8 aircraft

It will have a new MTOW of 238 tonnes and a new range of 13300 km which is 7200 nmi Airbus thinks that the 787 8 will have a range of 6720 nmi which is about 1000 nmi less than what Boeing said it would be

Korean Air will be the first airline to have the A330 200HGW It ordered the aeroplanes on 27 February 2009 and will get the first one in 2010

Because the Airbus A300 600F and Airbus A310F were getting old and companies had stopped ordering them Airbus decided to make a new freighter plane to replace them It started offering the aeroplane around the years 20002001 The aeroplane was talked about again at the 2006 Farnborough Airshow Airbus got permission to sell the plane in January 2007 and the first plane came out of the factory on 20 October 2009 The aircraft first flew on 5 November 2009

It can fly 64 tonnes of cargo over 4000 nmi or 69 tonnes over 3200 nmi The aeroplane was designed to use a new loading system that can use two different ways of holding cargo containers or pallets 

It has a new front landing gear system Normally the A330 200 points slightly downwards when it is on the ground This is good because the pilots can see the ground better but it makes loading the cargo harder With this new gear the aircraft sits straight so it is easier to load the cargo It works by making the point where the plane attaches to the gear lower This means that the nose has a bubble on the bottom to make sure the gear fits properly

Airbus has 67 orders for the A330 200F The customer who ordered the most planes is Intrepid Aviation Group who have ordered 20

This version is a tanker aircraft which means that it carries a lot of jet fuel to give to other planes It also has a few seats so that it can be used to carry passengers It is used by the military

The plane has been ordered by the Royal Australian Air Force the UKs Royal Air Force the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia

The plane was also offered to the US Air Force as a replacement for some of their Boeing KC 135 Stratotankers Eventually in 2002 they chose Boeings offering the KC 767 But this order was cancelled after a lot of political controversy In 2006 the Air Force started again Boeing again offered the KC 767 and Airbus teamed up with Northrop Grumman to make the KC 30 This time they chose the KC 30 and renamed it the KC 45A But Boeing complained that the ruling was not fair and the US Government Accountability Office agreed with Boeing The bid was cancelled again Northrop Grumman has decided not to offer the KC 45A again

The A330 300 started working in 1993 It competes with Boeings 777 200 and 767 400ER It was made as a replacement for the Airbus A300 It has a similar body to the A300 600 but it has new wings and systems

It carries 295 passengers in three classes or 335 in two classes or 440 in one class It can fly up to 5650 nmi

It has either two General Electric CF6 80E engines two Pratt Whitney PW4000 engines or two Rolls Royce Trent 700 engines All the engines are ETOPS rated at ETOPS 180 which means that the A330 300 can fly up to 180 minutes away from an airport that it can land at

80 airlines or companies currently use the A330 The ones with the most A330s are Cathay Pacific from Hong Kong who have 32 Delta Air Lines from the United States of America who have 32 Emirates Airline from the United Arab Emirates who have 29 Qatar Airways from Qatar who have 29 and Air China and China Eastern Airlines who are both in China and have 20 each

The A330 has had ten accidents two hull loss accidents There has been a total of 235 fatalities in the accidents

Germination occurs when a spore or seed starts to grow It is a term used in botany When a spore or seed germinates it produces a shoot or seedling or a hypha The biology of spores is different from seeds 

A spore germinates if and when conditions are right It has a very limited lifespan The method of spore bearers which are lower plants such as mosses ferns and also fungi is to produce vast numbers of spores of which only a small percentage germinate

Seeds contain an embryo a store of food and a protective coat Seed plants include Gymnosperms and Angiosperms Seeds can survive much longer than spores sometimes for hundreds of years The strategy of seed bearing plants is to invest energy and material in the substance of seeds and they have evolved more sophisticated methods of dispersal than just windp98

Seeds do not germinate until their requirements are met and these needs differ from species to species

The requirements for fruits is the same as for seeds A fruit is just a seed with one or more extra layers derived from parts of the flower

A fractal is any equation or pattern that when seen as an image produces a picture which can be zoomed into infinity and will still produce the same picture The word fractal was made by Benot Mandelbrot in 1975 from the Latin word fractus which means broken or fractured A simple example is a tree that branches infinitely into smaller branches and those branches into smaller branches and so on Fractals are not only beautiful but also have many practical applications

There are many types of fractals made in a large variety of ways One example is the Sierpinski triangle where there are an infinite number of small triangles inside the large one Another example is the Mandelbrot set named for Benot Mandelbrot The Sierpinksi triangle is constructed using patterns but the Mandelbrot set is based on an equation

There are also many natural examples of fractals in nature including trees snowflakes some vegetables and coastlines

Some fractals exist only for artistic reasons but others are very useful Fractals are very efficient shapes for radio antennas and are used in computer chips to efficiently connect all the components Also coastlines can be thought of as fractals

The EndOrdovician extinction event is the third largest extinction event of the Phanerozoic era The Ordovician period followed the Cambrian and was followed by the Silurian There were no living things on the land except for bacteria and perhaps some single celled algae The biota was almost entirely marine

The extinction came in two steps at the start and the finish of the Hirnantian stage which was the last stage of the Ordovician 

Basic mechanism climate changes from very warm to very cold and back to very warm Changes in ocean circulation were the results of the climate changes Both benthic and pelagic fauna were faced with conditions they were unable to cope with

More than 100 invertebrate families becam extinct in the EndOrdovician extinction event and a total of almost half the genera The brachiopods and bryozoans were decimated along with many of the trilobite conodont and graptolite families

The velvet worms are a minor Ecdysozoan phylum 

There are two families and 110 living species All living species are terrestrial in moist or wet tropical areas However the phylum goes back to the Cambrian and all the early specimens are from marine strata

The two living families are the Peripatidae and the Peripatopsidae They show a peculiar distribution with the peripatids being predominantly equatorial and tropical while the peripatopsids are all found in what used to be Gondwana

The segmented worm like organisms have tiny eyes antennae multiple pairs of legs and slime glands The group is thought to be related to arthropods They prey on smaller animals such as insects which they catch by squirting a sticky slime

Tardigrades form the phylum Tardigrada part of the superphylum Ecdysozoa They are microscopic water dwelling segmented animals 

Tardigrades were first described in 1773 There are more than 1000 different species of tardigrade 

Tardigrades have a cylindrical shape with four segments each with two legs Each of their limbs have little claws The biggest adults may reach a body length of 12 mm the smallest below 01 mm Freshly hatched larvae may be smaller than 005 mm Tardigrades feed on plant cells by penetrating the cell wall and eating what is inside Some tardigrades are carnivores

Tardigrades can be found in many habitats in moss freshwater the Himalayas and the ocean They are one of the few animals that can be found on the highest mountains and the deepest seas About 83 percent of the species live on land the other 17 percent live in water

Tardigrades are able to live in environments that would kill most animals In 2007 scientists discovered that some tardigrades were able to survive 10 days in outer space Tardigrades can survive more than ten years without water Tardigrates can survive a few hours in temperatures close to absolute zero and above boiling point

Yellow journalism or the yellow press is a type of journalism that does not report much real news with facts It uses shocking headlines that catch peoples attention to sell more newspapers Yellow journalism might include exaggerating facts or spreading rumors The words yellow journalism are often used today to talk about journalism that the person talking does not like because he or she does not think it is serious journalism

In 1941 Frank Luther Mott said that there were five things that made up yellow journalism

The term came from the American Gilded Age of the late 1800s with two newspaper owners who fought to get more readers and sell more newspapers than the other These were Joseph Pulitzers and the New York World and William Randolph Hearst with the New York Journal The most important part of this fight was from 1895 to about 1898 When people talk about yellow journalism in history they are often talking about these years Both papers were accused of sensationalizing the news in order to sell more newspapers although the newspapers did serious reporting as well The New York Press came up with the term yellow kid journalism in early 1897 after a then popular comic strip to talk about the newspapers of Pulitzer and Hearst which both published versions of it during a circulation war Ervin Wardman publisher of the New York Herald came up with the term

Joseph Pulitzer bought the New York World in 1883 after making the St Louis Post Dispatch the biggest daily newspaper in that city Pulitzer tried to make the New York World fun to read and filled his paper with pictures games and contests that brought in new readers Crime stories filled many of the pages with headlines like Was He a Suicide and Screaming for Mercy Also Pulitzer only charged readers two cents per issue but gave readers eight and sometimes 12 pages of information

While there were many sensational stories in the New York World they were by no means the only stories or even the biggest ones Pulitzer believed that newspapers were important and had a duty to make society better and he tried to do this with his newspaper

Just two years after Pulitzer took it over the World sold more copies than any other newspaper in New York Part of this was because he was connected to the Democratic Party Older publishers who were jealous of Pulitzers success began saying bad things about the World They talked about how he had crime stories and stunts but ignored its more serious reporting Charles Anderson DanaCharles Dana editor of the New York Sun attacked The World and said Pulitzer was deficient in judgment and in staying power

William Randolph Hearst a mining heir who bought the San Francisco Examiner from his father in 1887 noticed what Pulitzer was doing Hearst read the World while studying at Harvard University and decided to try to make the Examiner as bright as Pulitzers paper While he was in charge the Examiner gave 24 percent of its space to crime presenting the stories as morality plays and put adultery and nudity on the front page A month after Hearst took over the paper the Examiner ran this headline about a hotel fire HUNGRY FRANTIC FLAMES They Leap Madly Upon the Splendid Pleasure Palace by the Bay of Monterey Encircling Del Monte in Their Ravenous Embrace From Pinnacle to Foundation Leaping Higher Higher Higher With Desperate Desire Running Madly Riotous Through Cornice Archway and Facade Rushing in Upon the Trembling Guests with Savage Fury Appalled and Panic Striken the Breathless Fugitives Gaze Upon the Scene of Terror The Magnificent Hotel and Its Rich Adornments Now a Smoldering heap of Ashes The Examiner Sends a Special Train to Monterey to Gather Full Details of the Terrible Disaster Arrival of the Unfortunate Victims on the Mornings Train A History of Hotel del Monte The Plans for Rebuilding the Celebrated Hostelry Particulars and Supposed Origin of the Fire

Hearst could be hyperbolic in his crime coverage one of his early stories about a band of murderers attacked the police for forcing Examiner reporters to do their work for them But while doing these things the Examiner also increased its space for international news and sent reporters out to uncover corruption and inefficiency in the city government In one story Examiner reporter Winifred Black went into a San Francisco hospital as a patient and discovered that the women there were treated with gross cruelty The entire hospital staff was fired the morning the story was printed

With the Examiner having success by the early 1890s Hearst began looking for a New York newspaper to buy and bought the New York Journal in 1895 a newspaper that sold for oen penny which Pulitzers brother Albert had sold to a Cincinnati publisher the year before

After noticing what Pulitzer had done by keeping his newspaper at two cents Hearst made the Journals only cost one cent while providing as much information as rival newspapers This worked and as the Journals had 150000 people subscribe to it Pulitzer cut his price to a penny hoping to make Hearst run out of money Hearst then hired many people who were working for World in 1896 While most sources say that Hearst simply offered more money Pulitzer who had grown more abusive to his employees had become a very difficult man to work for and many World employees were willing to switch newspapers just to get away from him

Although the competition between the World and the Journal was fierce the newspapers had a lot in common Both were Democratic both took the side of organized labor and immigrants and both spent a lot of money making their Sunday publications which were like weekly magazines going beyond just daily journalism

Their Sunday entertainment features included the first color comic strip pages and some think that the term yellow journalism originated there while as noted above the New York Press left the term it invented undefined Hogans Alley a comic strip about a bald child in a yellow nightshirt became very popular when cartoonist Richard F Outcault began drawing it in the World in early 1896 When Hearst hired Outcault away Pulitzer asked artist George Luks to continue drawing the strip with his characters giving the city two Yellow Kids The use of yellow journalism as a term for over the top sensationalism in the US apparently started with more serious newspapers commenting how far the Yellow Kid papers went

Pulitzer and Hearst are often credited for drawing the nation into the Spanish American War with their sensationalism However most of Americans did not live in New York City and the decision makers who did live there probably read less sensationalist newspapers like the Times The Sun or the Post The most famous example of the exaggeration is the story which probably is not actually true that artist Frederic Remington sent Hearst a telegram to tell him that not much was going on in Cuba and There will be no war Hearst responded Please remain You furnish the pictures and Ill furnish the war The story first showed up in the memoirs of reporter James Creelman in 1901 and there is no other source for it

But Hearst did want the United States to go to war after a rebellion broke out in Cuba in 1895 Stories about Cubans being good people and Spain treating Cuba badly soon showed up on his front page While the stories were probably not very accurate the newspaper readers of the 19th century did not expect or necessarily want his stories to be pure nonfiction Historian Michael Robertson has said that Newspaper reporters and readers of the 1890s were much less concerned with distinguishing among fact based reporting opinion and literature

Pulitzer although he did not have Hearsts resources kept the story on his front page The yellow press published a lot about the revolution but conditions on Cuba were bad enough The island was in a bad economic depression and Spanish general Valeriano Weyler sent to crush the rebellion herded Cuban peasants into concentration camps leading hundreds of Cubans to their deaths Having fought for a fight for two years Hearst took credit for the conflict when it came A week after the United States declared war on Spain he ran How do you like the Journals war on his front page In fact President William McKinley never read the Journal and newspapers like the Tribune and the New York Evening Post Also journalism historians have noted that yellow journalism mostly only happened in New York City and that newspapers in the rest of the country did not do it The Journal and the World were not among the top ten sources of news in regional papers and their stories did not catch peoples attention outside New York City  

Hearst sailed to Cuba when the invasion began as a war correspondent providing sober and accurate accounts of the fighting Creelman later praised the work of the reporters for writing about how Spain treated Cuba arguing no true history of the war  can be written without an acknowledgment that whatever of justice and freedom and progress was accomplished by the Spanish American war was due to the enterprise and tenacity of yellow journalists many of whom lie in unremembered graves

Hearst was a well known Democrat who promoted William Jennings Bryan for president in 1896 and 1900 He later ran for mayor and governor and even tried to get nominated for president but his reputation was hurt in 1901 after columnist Ambrose Bierce and editor Arthur Brisbane published separate columns months apart that suggested that President William McKinley be assassinated When McKinley was shot on September 6 1901 critics accused Hearsts Yellow Journalism of driving Leon Czolgosz to the deed Hearst did not know of Bierces column and claimed to have pulled Brisbanes after it ran in a first edition but the incident would haunt him for the rest of his life and all but destroyed his dream to be president

Pulitzer haunted by what had happened returned the World to its crusading roots as the new century dawned  By the time of his death in 1911 the World was a widely respected publication and would remain a leading progressive paper until its demise in 1931

The Sea spiders belong to the class Pycnogonida of the phylum Arthropoda Sea spider are sea dwelling animal that looks somewhat like a spider There are about 500 species Sea spiders are found in all oceans Species found in coastal waters are usually small and have a leg span of about 1 inch those living at great depths up to 24 inches

The sea spider has a small narrow body It usually has four pairs of long thin legs attached to the abdomen Attached to the head there are usually three other pairs of appendagesa pair called chelicerae used for grasping food a pair of sensory projections called palps and a pair of egg carrying legs The female lays round masses of eggs upon the egg carrying legs of the male which carries the eggs until they hatch

On top of its head the sea spider has a knobby projection bearing two three or four simple eyes The head ends in a snout with a sucking mouth Sea spiders feed by sucking the body juices of such marine animals as sea anemones sponges and sea squirts

Caving also called Spelunking is the hobby of exploring caves People who explore or study caves are called Spelunkers Spelunking is the recreational sport of exploring caves

Wise spelunkers explore in groups to prevent being lost or stranded in a cave Spelunkers need reliable equipment because the descent into a cave is like mountain climbing in the opposite direction Basic spelunking equipment is similar to what mountain climbers use Strong ropes make climbing possible and special tools attach ropes to cave walls Special footwear makes it easier to explore hard to reach places and hard hats protect spelunkers from falling rocks above Caves are extremely dark so spelunkers have to carry at least three light sources One light source attaches to a spelunkers helmet so it is with him or her at all times Caves are also very cold so most spelunkers wear heavy clothing for warmth

Spelunkers tie their ropes with different kinds of knots From the farmers hitch knot to the alpine butterfly knot spelunkers choose knots for different purposes Some knots work well to hold people as they climb Other knots are best for tying ropes together

Caving today has become a hobby for many different reasons Some cavers are interested in conservation Others are interested in gathering hard data about caves Geologists explore caves for the purpose of learning about the formation of rocks and formations But for most of the rest the purpose of caving is just to have fun 

Getting involved in caving in the United States is through the National Speleological Society or NSS for short There one can find a local chapter or grotto and hook up with individuals who will help train and educate the novice caver and point to the right type of gear to be purchased Caves can generally be explored during any season of the year Most caves remain at the same temperature year round

Chitons are primitive marine molluscs in the class Polyplacophora There are 900 to 1000 extant species of chitons in the class which was formerly known as Amphineura Their size ranges from 05 to 30cm in length most are quite small 

Chitons are also called sea cradles or coat of mail shells They are more formally called loricates or polyplacophorans They have a single shell that sticks to rocks like a limpet The shell is made of hard plates that fit tightly together overlapping one another The shell plates are surrounded by a structure known as a girdle

Chitons are in their own class Polyplacophora which means many plates The plates refer to its shell which is made of aragonite a calcium carbonate mineral The shell is quite flexible and the chiton can even roll into a ball The chiton has eight plates and underneath the plates is a muscular foot that moves the chiton over rocks and other structures both in and out of the water It also has a tongue shaped structure called the broken wikt linkradularadula which has many rows of 17 teeth each Some use it to scrape algae off rocks while others are carnivorous catching tiny zooplankton and other small animals that live in shallow water

Chitons can be less than an inch long or up to a foot long They come in many different colors black red pink and even blue The shell might be shiny or dull or smooth hairy scaly or spiny depending on the species

If a chiton was picked up and turned over there would be no eyes legs or arms There would only be a wide foot with a radula that it uses for scraping surfaces Its mantle is right under the shell with the lowest part of the mantle coming out under the edge of the shell to help its foot grip the surfaces on which it clings or slides along The part of the mantle which sticks out is called the girdle Like the moon snail the girdle may extend out over the bottom part of the shell covering the bottom half of the chiton 

Most chitons are nocturnal so they feed at night and hide under rocks during the day Their main habitat is the intertidal zone They live on hard surfaces such as on or under rocks or in rock crevices Some species live quite high in the intertidal zone and are exposed to the air and light for long periods Others live subtidally A few species live in deep water as deep as 6000 m

Chitons have a relatively good fossil record stretching back 400 million years to the Devonian Before this some organisms have been interpreted as stem group polyplacophora the record of polyplacophora stretches back to the Upper Cambrian

Kimberella and Wiwaxia of the Precambrian and Cambrian may be related to ancestral polyplacophora Matthevia is a late Cambrian polyplacophoran preserved as individual pointed valves and sometimes considered to be a chiton The polyplacophorans may have formed when an aberrant monoplacophoran was born with multiple centres of calcification rather than the usual one Selection acted on the resultant conical shells to form them to overlap into protective armour Their original cones are homologous with the tips of the plates of modern chitons

The Sand dollars are species of flattened burrowing sea urchins belonging to the order Clypeasteroida Echinarachnius parma the Common Sand Dollar is widespread in the Northern Hemisphere from the intertidal zone to considerable depths Sand dollars can be found in temperate and tropical zones but not in Great Britainp76

All sand dollars have a rigid skeleton known as a test This is the typical white disk found washed up on beaches The living animals have a skin of movable spines on the test Movement is done by the action of the spines Like other sea urchins sand dollars have five paired rows of pores The pores are arranged in a petal like pattern These pores are perforations in the endoskeleton through which the tube feet used in gas exchange project from the body

Living sand dollars have small spines covering its entire body They are softer and much shorter than those of the sea urchin Like all echinoderms sand dollars have tube feet They are not used to move around but simply to breathe The sand dollars tube feet actually stick out of the top of the sand dollar On a sand dollar test there is usually a pattern that looks like the petals of a flower That pattern is made up of many tiny holes and it is through these holes that the sand dollars tube feet came out when it was alive

A sand dollar uses its tiny spines to move around and to dig into the sand It often does this to bury itself in the sand Sometimes a sand dollar will only partially bury itself in the sand and ends up poking up from the sand standing on its side

On the underside of a sand dollar there is a star pattern spreading out from the center where the mouth is This star pattern is made up of broken wikt linkgroovegrooves that are called food grooves Sand dollars filter sand and water catching plankton and other things on their spines Then with cilia the spines move the food into a food groove and the food travels down the food groove to the mouth Its food consists of crustacean larvae small copepods diatoms algae and detritus

The sand dollars are the most specialised sea urchins All their features are adaptations for burrowing They live just beneath the sand either flat or at an angle At an angle they keep the edge facing the oncoming currents presumably to catch food This excellent habitat has been taken up by other groups of sea urchins The heart urchins another order are even more effective in burrowingp76

Most living sand dollars have dark colours like brown or purple Their darker color helps them stay camouflaged easily hiding in the sand or mud or on the sea floor The tests of sand dollars do not have bristles and tube feet and because of the sun they usually become broken wikt linkbleachbleached white

Ot en Sien are two little children who appear in a series of stories which were written in the Dutch language more than a hundred years ago  Ot is a little boy and Sien whose name may be short for Francine is the little girl who lives next door Although they are now very old fashioned the books are still popular in Holland They were written in rhyme and were illustrated with colourful pictures

The author of the stories was called Hendricus Scheepstra The ideas for the stories were given to him by Jan Ligthart Cornelis Jetses made the illustrations

The stories are set in Drenthe which is in the north eastern part of the Netherlands Drenthe was a very poor part of the country but Ot and Sien live in a nice house and are quite well off They are often seen playing in the garden with their toys which include a wooden horse on wheels and a doll in a dollys pushchair The cat is often in the picture They are also seen at school

The authors wrote the stories to show a happy family life Everyone is very friendly in the book and strangers help them when they get lost in the street The family have a servant who helps in the house

The stories were widely read by children in schools in the Netherlands until after the Second World War By then they had become very old fashioned The daily life of Ot and Sien seemed to belong to a time long ago in history  Hardly any Dutch children now live in a family with a servant No Dutch child nowadays goes for a walk dressed in sailors costume with a father who wears a cloak and hat The books are no longer read in schools but they continue to be popular with Dutch people at home In 2004 one hundred years after the first book was written a special exhibition about Ot and Sien was held

The Korean Magpie Pica sericea is usually thought of as an East Asian species of magpie It is a common symbol of Korea and has been adopted as the official bird of many South Korean cities and countries

It is similar to the European magpie with a shorter tail and longer wings It has black and purple colors but very little green The Korean magpie has the same chattering call as European magpies though it is much softer

Koreans believed that magpies delivered good news and when they saw a magpie chattering they believed that visitors were comingThe most famous painting related to a magpie is the one with striped tiger the magpie is chirping to a tiger The magpie represented good news and the tiger symbolized good luck since its pronunciation in Chinese sounds similar to good luck There are many folktales about magpies

The Chinese called magpies Birds of Joy or Happy Magpies Under the Manchu dynasty it also represented broken wikt linkimperialimperial rule a few Manchu people in Northeast China even thought they were gods In the west though magpies were often a symbol of broken wikt linkpridevanity

Left handedness is the preference to use the left hand more than the right hand for daily activities such as writing or using tools Most people can use either hand for many things However people very often have a definite preference for using the left or right hand for things such as using a pen using a knife using scissors brushing teeth blowing their nose and so on People who do not have a preference are called ambidextrous

People do not just have preferences with things they do with their hands they may for example be left footed if they prefer to kick a ball with the left foot or push harder with the left foot on a bicycle pedal

Far more people are right handed than left handed It is difficult to measure exactly how many because each person has a different mixture of preferences but about one person in ten or twenty is left handed

Because left handed people are different from most others being left handed has often been thought of as bad For many years right handedness was seen as normal and left handedness as not normal In Hebrew as well as in other ancient Semitic and Mesopotamian languages the word left was a symbol of power In many European languages right means correct In law the word right means authority and justice in a democracy everyone has certain rights In Russian and other Slavic languages prav is used in words meaning correct or truth Someone who is skilled with their hands is called dexterous But left often means awkward in many languages In French gauche also means clumsy In English the word sinister means evil We also say that someone has two left feet meaning that they are clumsy with their feet

Sometimes people who are left handed are called Southpaws

Things that are designed by right handed people can cause problems for left handed ones These include guns cameras screws and in recent years the computer mouse and the iPhone Many objects are sold in left handed versions which are often more expensive than the right handed versions

Scissors especially cause left handed people some trouble Most scissors are made for right handed people Because they are designed this way if a person tries to cut something while holding the scissors in their left hand they cannot see the edge they are cutting The way the cutting action works is also designed for right handers and left handed people tend to force the blades open instead of cutting cleanly Even though some scissors say that they can be used by both left and right handed people these scissors only have their handles changed They are still right handed scissors and still cause the same issues

It can be difficult for left handed children to learn to write if the teacher does not give them special help The reason for this is that most writing moves from left to right across the page This means that left handed writers may hold their hand over what has just been written

In many countries children are allowed to write with whichever hand is easier although there are some countries where children may be made to write with the right hand Many things can be difficult for left handed writers Chairs with writing boards may all be made for right handed people This makes left handed people sit awkwardly and hold their pens in an awkward way

Recent research has shown that it can be an advantage for animals and for humans to be left handed Being able to do things differently from most people can be a great help in many sports such as tennis or fighting with swords In tennis left handed players hold the racket in their left hand Because of this their grip of the handle is supposedly adjusted in a slightly different style from right handed players Some world champion tennis players that play with their left hand include Jimmy Connors Guillermo Vilas John McEnroe Martina Navratilova Marcelo Ros and Rafael Nadal

Cumulus clouds are white clouds that are dense and large They are known to look like cauliflower Mostly you can see easily that cumulus clouds have flat bottoms but the tops are always changing shape

Alexei Fyodorovich Karamazov is the hero of Fyodor Dostoevskys novel The Brothers Karamazov He is also called Alyosha Alyoshka Alyoshenka Alyoshechka Alexeichik Lyosha and Lyoshenka He is the youngest of the Karamazov brothers being then only twenty The authors broken wikt linkprefacepreface and first chapters declare that he is the novels hero

Alyosha is physically described as

His personality is remarkably unselfish extremely mature in his religious faith sensitive to other peoples feelings and loving  he certainly loved people throughout his life he seemed to believe in people and to trust them and yet no one ever thought him simple minded or naive There was something in him that made people realize that he refused to sit in judgment on others that he felt he had no right to and that whatever happened he would never broken wikt linkcondemncondemn anyone He passes on the influence of Zosima to the younger generation of the town Even with all his kind goodness he has a gentle personality that makes almost everybody love him and feel comfortable around him Proud young Kolya Krasotkin says that the best thing about Alyosha is that he treats him like an equal

Anna Theresa Tymieniecka says that Alyosha like Prince Myshkin the protagonist in another Dostoevsky novel The Idiot are almost Jesus like characters who are however unable to stop the greatest suffering of those around them She suggests that Alyosha is too calm and does not do much action in the events of the novel

Rufus W Mathewson however argues that Alyosha Karamazov is a more successful positive hero than Prince Myshkin He argues that Alyoshas most impressive success as helping Dmitri He describes Alyosha as using forgiveness kindness and natural justice rather than trying to change people

It is probable that Dostoevsky used his friend Vladimir Solovyovs character for Alyosha Vladimir Solovyov was a Russian poet and philosopher who was very generous even giving away his clothes to people in the street

Stratus clouds are low altitude gray clouds that make a flat base The name comes from the Latin word stratus which means to stretch or extend You can see stratus clouds as thick cloud blankets near the sea They are sometimes called high fogs Light rain and drizzle often fall from stratus clouds When rain falls from stratus clouds they are mostly called nimbostratus 

The Pliosaurs were a group of large submarine plesiosaur reptiles from the Mesozoic era They had short necks and large heads in contrast to other plesiosaurs Their sizes ranged from two to 15 metres and they were predators of large fish and other reptiles Their streamlined body shape suggests they swam and ate under waterp29

The first specimen was found by Mary Anning on the Jurassic Coast of Lyme Regis England in the 1820s Many of her finds are on display in the Natural History Museum London

It was suggested by DMS Watson that plesiosaurs fell into two groups The pliosaurs were large predators which ate large prey in deep water The other plesiosaurs were long necked with smaller heads Their method was as surface swimmers mostly eating with their head above water darting down to snatch smaller fish which were feeding on plankton

Ball lightning is a glowing ball of lightning that sometimes appears in a thunderstorm but usually lasts much longer than lightning Scientists do not understand ball lightning very well and some even do not think ball lightning is real because it is so strange However it has been widely reported in weather journals by many trustworthy people So it is very possible that it is real

Those who have seen it say its the size of a grapefruit or basketball it has even been said to be as big as a car The glowing ball is either red orange or yellow A few people have seen it falling from clouds Sometimes ball lightning floats or glides just above the ground for a few seconds or it can roll on the surface of an object Hissing noises come from the fiery orb Some have even thought it was a UFO Ball lightning sometimes explodes loudly while other times it just quietly disappears It has been known to smash or simply go through windows hopping and sizzling across the floor and then disappear into things like TVs or up the chimney Some say that ball lightning can kill humans while others say that its effect on humans are harmless

Many people are said to have seen ball lightning Ebenezer Cobham Brewer wrote about globular lightning saying they may fall to the ground or explode like a cannon Laura Ingalls Wilder writes in her book about ball lightning saying that when she was little she saw balls of light which her mother chased away with a broom

The Sauropterygia was a superorder of successful aquatic reptiles that flourished during the Mesozoic era They are united by an adaptation of their shoulder designed to support powerful paddle strokes Some later sauropterygians like the pliosaurs developed a similar mechanism in their pelvis

The earliest sauropterygians appeared about 245 million years ago at the start of the Triassic period At first they were small less than a metre They were semi aquatic lizard like animals with long limbs They developed into a group called the nothosaurs several meters long The sauropterygians included another very distinctive group the placodonts They were bottom feeders on shellfish and possessed flat crushing teeth to handle their preyp148151

The end Triassic extinction event wiped them all out except for the plesiosaurs During the earliest Jurassic these diversified quickly into the long necked small headed plesiosaurs proper and short necked large headed pliosaurs

Found at the base of some continental slopes ocean trenches have relatively steepsides falling dramatically to the ocean floor In geology subduction is the theoretical process whereby one oceanic plate slides under another crustal plate Subduction is believed to work by density As the heavy plate descends steeply into the earth the lighter or less dense the two plates rides over the edge of the heavier plate The long narrow belt produced by this process is called the subduction zone It is in these areas that oceanic trenches form that can be approximately 1500 miles long several miles deep and as much as 70 miles wide

Oceanographers cite at least five trenches that are over 6 miles deep Trenches are active with earthquakes and resulting tsunamis Most volcanism associated with trench occurs on the continent and not on the seafloor However many of the oceans volcanic islands and seamounts are found in what are called island arcs bending chains of islands rising from the sea floor usually paralleling the concave edges of an oceanic trench The western Pacific has island arcsm as do the Aleutian Islands 

Near the island of Guam is the famous Mariana Trench located where the Pacific Plate descends under the leading edge of the Eurasian Plate Measured at 36201 feet  over 68 miles deep this trench is the deepest known spot in any ocean In 1960 two brave men in the bathyscaph Trieste reached the Mariana Trench  a truly daring accomplishment Other extensive trench regions around the world include the South Sandwich Trench between South America and Antarctica the Peru Chile Trench and the Aleutian Trench

Oviparous animals are animals that reproduce by laying eggs This is how most fish amphibians reptiles insects and arachnids reproduce All birds and monotremes also reproduce like this

Most animals that live on land lay eggs that are protected by hard shells They fertilize their eggs internally Water dwelling animals like fish and amphibians lay eggs that have not been fertilized yet Then the males lay sperm on top of the eggs which is called external fertilization

No mammals except for monotremes reproduce like this Instead they are viviparous Fish amphibians and reptiles that are not oviparous are oviviparous This means that the eggs hatch while still inside the mothers body

The Aplacophora is a class of small deep water exclusively benthic shell less marine molluscs They are found in all oceans of the world They are a small group of molluscs which have deviated from the normal molluscan form There are approximately 100 known species living today They are rather worm like and average about an inch in length 

Most live in deep water except a few more northern species One group bury themselves into the sand and mud of the ocean bottom where they feed on annelids and other small invertebrates The rest of the known aplacophorans parasitize hydroids and other corals

This class used to be classified as sea cucumbers in the echinoderms In 1987 they were officially recognized as molluscs and given their own class The class is polyphyletic and consists of two clades

Monoplacophora is a class of molluscs They have a cap like shell and live on the bottom of the sea 

They were discovered as a living group in 1952 one of the most remarkable modern discoveries As they were last known from the Devonian fossil record this makes them a Lazarus taxon 

More than that they are the most extreme example of the pull of the Recent which is a term in palaeontology All fossil groups have a first and last appearance in the fossil record but for living species their last appearance is the present day This may be very much later than their last appearance as a fossil The discovery of the living monoplacs extended their time range by 400 million years

Aboriginal artists have painted the Rainbow Serpent on cave walls or on pieces of bark The earliest cave paintings found are about 8000 years old In special ceremonies they sometimes honour the Rainbow Serpent by painting their handprints on the magic snake Scientists believe the Rainbow Serpent stories began at the end of the last ice age The rising sea levels would have forced a lot of people to move inland The Rainbow Serpent became a symbol of both creation and destruction and of unity and peace This makes the Rainbow Serpent a symbol of the worlds oldest continuing religion

In the Dreamtime the Rainbow Serpent helped the world along with rain At the beginning of time the Rainbow Serpent awoke from its sleep and pushed through the Earths crust As it travelled over the empty land it left behind deep tracks The Rainbow Serpent called to the frogs to come out from beneath the earth It tickled the frogs bellies and when they laughed water poured out from their open mouths The water filled the Rainbow Serpents deep tracks making rivers and lakes Slowly grass began to grow Then all kind of creatures in Australia  birds lizards snakes kangaroos koalas and dingoes  woke up and took their places on the earth

There is a lot of pollution in the Ganges because everyone releases their waste into the Ganges This causes a lot of sicknesses like cholera hepatitis typhoid and amoebic dysentery The presence of coliform bacteria in the waters has increased well above normal This is a major cause of water pollution These diseases cause about a third of the deaths in India every year That is why the government has started a multi crore project called the Ganga Action Plan

During the early Vedic Age the Indus and the Sarasvati River were the major rivers of the Indian subcontinent not the Ganges But the later three Vedas seem to give much more importance to the Ganges as shown by its numerous references Possibly the first European Traveler to mention the Ganges was Megasthenes In Romes Piazza Navona Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi was designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini and built in 1651 Th art work symbolizes four of the worlds great rivers which is to represent the four continents

Hindus regard the Ganges as not only a river but also a mother a goddess a tradition a culture and much more In Hinduism it is considered holy to take a pilgrimage to the Ganges and take a dip This leads to more illness adding to the death toll Many Hindus believe that bathing in the Ganga can purify a persons soul of all past sins some believe that it can also cure the illness So many Hindu families keep Ganga water in their homes as they consider it to be very pure The holy towns like Haridwar Allahabad Kanpur and Varanasi attract thousands of pilgrims Thousands of Hindu pilgrims arrive at these towns to bathe in the Ganges

According to Hindu Puranas a king named Bhagiratha did Tapasya for many years to bring the River Ganges Ganges was then residing in the Heavens By the help of pure Ganga waters Bhagirath wanted to release his ancestors of a curse Therefore the Ganges descended to the Earth to make the earth pious fertile and wash out the sins of humans

The water of the Ganges is used extensively in agriculture in the fertile Gangetic plains Chief crops cultivated in the area include rice sugarcane lentils oil seeds potatoes and wheat Along the banks of the river the swamps and lakes provide a good growing area for crops such as legumes chillies mustard sesame sugarcane and jute Fishing is also done in the Ganga waters Industries which require a large amount of water are set up on the banks of the river The Ganges is popular for river rafting which attract many adventurers in the summer months Tourism is also a related acivity In the modern times many resorts are made near the river

Shawnee Park is a park in Louisville Kentucky It was created by Frederick Law Olmsted who made 18 of the citys 123 public parks Along with the rest of the citys Olmsted designed park system Shawnee Park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982

Shawnee Park was first planned in 1890 to be one of the free flagship parks in Louisvilles new park system All three were found on the geographic edges of the city In Shawnees case it was the western edge bordering the Ohio River The land at the time was still mostly used for truck farms but it was clear residential development was imminent even without the park Shawnee was the slowest of the parks to create as much of the land was already owned by investors who thought they could increase the sale price by holding out

The city had to force owners to sell the properties to obtain the land for the park and won the case in 1895 In 1896 the city started to create access to the park another area in which Shawnee was behind the other two parks River Park Drive was laid out in 1899 but the Broadway entrance remained unfinished until 1914

The Olmsted firm advised the city not to build a golf course at Shawnee Park due to the grave danger to visitors in the park and especially the children but demand was such that the course was built anyway in 1927

All three parks had the intended effect of spurring residential development near them The interest was so great that developers found themselves promoting the parks rather than their own developments as the highest prices would exist for the park perceived to be best Dozens of subdivisions were built near Shawnee Park and the neighborhood itself came to be called Shawnee

Shawnee Park allowed access only to whites from 1924 to 1954 although park officials and police had a de facto policy of not allowing blacks access to the park for some years prior to that The only park blacks were allowed access to was nearby Chickasaw Park which many people entered by traveling through Shawnee

Although now overshadowed by the Louisville Waterfront Park Shawnee boasts an expansive Great Lawn which is very useful for formal gatherings The Great Lawn the principal feature of the park is enclosed by plantings and a circular drive that is lined with trees

Louisvilles Riverwalk Trail which passes through Shawnee Park extends across Louisvilles waterfront which is an extensive mostly flat pedestrian pathway The one way distance between the Belvedere and Shawnee Park is 62 miles

The dugong Dugong dugon is a large mammal that lives its whole life in the sea 

They are sometimes called sea cows as they eat large amounts of sea grass They live in warm shallow areas where the sea grass grows This area includes the north coast of Australia and in other countries in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean 

Dugongs are more closely related to elephants than to other sea creatures Their closest aquatic relative is the manatee a fresh water species found in America and West Africa

The dugong can grow to about convert3mft0lkonabbron long and weigh as much as convert400kglb0lkonabbron They only come to the surface to breathe and unlike seals they never come up on the land A baby dugong is called a calf It drinks milk from its mother until about two years old A dugong reaches its adult size between the ages of 9 and 17 years The dugong can live for up to 70 years of age They are grey to brown in color They have a tail with flukes like a whale and flippers They do not have a dorsal fin like a shark They have a wide flat nose small eyes and small ears

The dugong is a migratory animal but very slow moving Studies by James Cook University showed that while many dugongs traveled less than convert15kmmi0lkonabbron some went as far as convert560kmmi0lkonabbron Scientists believe that dugongs move long distances for several reasons They may be looking for food as cyclones or floods can affect the seagrass Males may be following females or looking for their own territory If the water gets cold less than 17 degrees Centigrade they will travel to warmer areas 

Because of their size the only other species to attack dugongs are sharks the Saltwater Crocodile and killer whales

Linguistic reductions in English are lost sounds in words This happens in spoken English For instance going to changes to gonna  The most widely known reductions are contractions Most contractions are reductions of not For instance cannot becomes cant Many contractions are reductions between a subject and a verb For instance He is becomes Hes

Some reductions are well known to language learners for instance the reduction of a verb and to Examples are going to becoming gonna and want to becoming wanna 

There are several basic categories of reductions

Ellision is one or more sounds left out of a word One example is and It frequently changes to an or sometimes even n Another example is the ba sound in probably This leads to the pronunciation probly

Word stress is a weaker stress on a word The other words around it are stressed more by comparison The weakly stressed word may be blended linked or even deleted 

Function words are words that signify grammatical relations They are different from content words Content words tend to carry more information They are often stressed Function words are often unstressed They may be reduced blended linked or deleted

These reductions are part of natural English They cannot be considered slang or improper

Random sampling is a way of sampling data In a random sample every element in the population has an equal chance of being selected For instance to do an election poll calling people randomly out of the phone book would be better than asking people only at a labor union meeting or at a small business convention A page of the phone book is a more random sample of voters than a union meeting so the result is more likely to tell who will really be elected But neither sample is really random because for one thing some people do not have phones

There are usually fewer state senators than there are members in a states lower house In the past this meant that senators represented different regions within a state not according to the population of the region This was a way of balancing the power of the lower house where the numbers for each state were related to the states population In 1963 the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that state legislatures must give seats in both houses depending on the population of the state

A Bicameral system of government is one where there are two legislative or parliamentary chambers

For legislation to be passed bicameral legislatures normally need a majority of its members to vote for the legislation

A Unicameral system of government is one where there is only one legislative or parliamentary chambers

It comes from the Latin uni and camera

In the United States only the state of Nebraska uses a unicameral system All the other states use a bicameral system instead 

The Nebraska Legislature is the highest legislative body of the State of Nebraska It meets at the Nebraska State Capitol in the City of Lincoln in Lancaster County

Nebraskas Legislature is unusual because it is unicameral It is also the smallest state legislature in the United States of America as it only has 49 members

An upper house is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature The other chamber is called the lower house

A lower house is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature The other chamber is called the upper house

Although it is called the lower house in many legislatures in the world it actually has more power than the upper house

The Atari 5200 SuperSystem or simply the Atari 5200 was a video game console which came out in 1982 It was made by Atari Inc and was supposed to replace the popular Atari 2600 Atari wanted the 5200 to compete with the Intellivision but it competed more closely with the ColecoVision 

The 5200 was based on Atari Incs 400800 computers Even though the internal hardware was almost identical the software was not Design mistakes meant that the 5200 had problems with its use These problems made it a poor seller

The games Atari 400 based design made for a design which Atari Inc could quickly build and sell 

While it was being designed the Atari 5200 called the Atari Video System X  Advanced Video Computer System Atari protected the design with a codename Pam after a female employee at Atari A rumor said that Pam or PAM actually stood for Personal Arcade Machine This was because most games for the system were based on existing arcade games Actual working Atari Video System X machines whose hardware is 100 identical to the Atari 5200 do exist but they are extremely rare 

The first 1982 release had four controller ports where nearly all other systems of the day had only two The 5200 also featured a very special new controller with an analog joystick numeric keypad two fire buttons on both sides of the controller and game function keys for Start Pause and Reset Another special thing was the first automatic TV switchbox Older game systems which attached to a televisions antenna leads required the user to slide a switch on the adapter by hand This RF box was also where the games power supply connected in a unique dual powertelevision signal setup similar to the RCA Studio IIs A single cable coming out of the 5200 plugged into the switch box and was used for both electricity and the television signal

The 1983 version of the Atari 5200 has two controller ports instead of four Atari changed back to the a simpler separate power supply and manual RF switch It also had changes in the cartridge port to allow for the Atari 2600 adapter released that year While the adapter was only made to work on the two port version modifications can be made to the four port to make it compatible In fact towards the end of the four port models production run there were a limited number of consoles produced which included these modifications These consoles can be identified by an asterisk in their serial number

The prototypes used to design the controllers electrical systems used a so called yoke and gimbal taken from a radio control system used to fly model airplanes This simple design gave very nice control and was highly reliable The actual controllers sold with the game were quite different and a great disappointment to the development teams The design of the analog joystick which used a weak rubber boot rather than springs to center the stick proved to be hard to use and unreliable Another major flaw of the controllers was that the design did not provide smooth control through the travel of the stick This made controlling games awkward The controllers did however include a pause button This was a novelty at the time but would become standard on almost all future game systems Replacement joysticks were also released by other manufacturers

Atari Inc released the Pro Line Trak Ball controller for the system which was used for titles such as Centipede or Defender A paddle controller and an updated self centering version of the original controller were also being worked on but never made it to market

The controller was ranked the 10th worst video game controller by IGN editor Craig Harris

Although the Atari 5200s insides were very much like that of the 400800 home computers the differences were enough so that games designed for one would not run directly on the other

One of the most obvious differences was the 5200s lack of a keyboard However there were several others

Atari Corps later XE Games System revisited the idea of a console based on the 400800 hardware However as this was essentially just a 65XE computer with a keyboard which could be removed it was able to run most of the home computer titles directly

The Atari 5200 could not run software for the still popular Atari 2600 An adapter was later released in 1983 allowing it to play all Atari 2600 games using the more reliable controllers from the 2600 

Another problem was the lack of attention that Atari Inc gave to the console most of its attention went to the older Atari 2600 It faced an uphill battle competing with the ColecoVisions head start and a video game market which was beginning to fade

At one point Atari Inc planned on developing a smaller less expensive version of the Atari 5200 which would have gotten rid of the controller storage bin Code named the Atari 5100 only a few fully working prototype Atari 5100s were made before the project was canceled

On May 21 1984 during a press conference at which the Atari 7800 was introduced company executives revealed that the 5200 had been discontinued Total sales of the 5200 were reportedly in excess of 1 million units

Ante Paveli was the founding member of the Croatian national socialistfascist Ustae movement and terrorist organization in the 1930s Later during World War II he will be the leader of the Independent State of Croatia a puppet state of Nazi Germany

Ante Paveli was born in Bradina a small village roughly 15 kilometres south west of Hadii in Bosnia and Herzegovina then Austria Hungary although he draws his roots from southern Lika in the small town of Krivi Put on the central part of the Velebit plain His parents moved to Bosnia As an adult Ante Paveli decided to move to Zagreb to study the law An extremist even in his youth he became a member of the organization known as the Frankovci whose founder Dr Josip Frank was the father in law of Slavko Kvaternik an Austro Hungarian army officer In 1919 he was the interim secretary of the Pure Party of Rights In 1921 he was arrested along with several other members of the party but was released he defended them at the trial and lost Kvaternik had long been a strong advocate of Croat separatism and the German ideas on a separate Croat state found in him a ready tool

Pavelis quarrelsome nature became more and more apparent in the years immediately after the first war when he became involved in one dispute after another with the Centralist Party and the Croat Peasant Party of Radi He was the sole representative of his Party in the Skuptina but rarely attended sessions and when he did he sulked in his seat and only occasionally indulged in a long harangue in protest against some measure which he did not approve

In the early 1920s Paveli began to establish his contacts with Croat migres in Vienna and Budapest and later entered into close accord with the Macedonian terrorist society IMRO In 1927 he acted as counsel for the defense of the Macedonian terrorists at the Skopje trials  

In 1927 he was elected to the Zagreb city council He held the position of the party secretary in the Party of Rights until 1929 and the beginning of royal government in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Shortly after the proclamation of the establishment of the government Alexander I of Yugoslavia in January 1929 Paveli fled abroad and was subsequently sentenced to death in absentia at Belgrade for his part in anti Serb demonstrations organized at Sofia by Bulgarian and Macedonian terrorists He then co founded the Ustae terrorist organization and went underground 

Camps for training terrorists and saboteurs were set up in Italy and Hungary chiefly at Brescia and Borgotaro in Italy and Janka Puszta in Hungary and an armed insurrection was attempted in 1933 when the Ustae armed by the Italians attempted to invade the country by crossing the Adriatic sea in motorboats This was unsuccessful but its lack of success probably was instrumental in the decision to assassinate King Alexander I of Yugoslavia Two attempts were made the last one successful and Aleksandar was slain at Marseilles 9 October 1934 along with the French Foreign Minister Louis Barthou

The singular lack of armed protection afforded to the Yugoslav monarch and the general laxity of security precautions when it was well known that one attempt had already been made on Alexanders life are grim tributes to Paveli organizational abilities he had apparently been able to bribe a high official in the Surete General The Prefect of Police of Marseilles Jouhannaud was subsequently removed from office

Paveli remained in Italy until the beginning of World War II As the leader of the Ustae he directly ordered organized and conducted a campaign of terror against Serbs Jews Gypsies and communist Croats The extent of this campaign reached the proportions of genocide Pavelis Ustae regime was the most murderous Nazi puppet state in the whole of occupied Europe Numerous surviving testimonies from the Nuremberg Trials and the German and the Italian war archives bear witness to bestialities perpetrated against the civilian population of the state According to these testimonies the German officers themselves were horrified by the scenes of atrocities committed by his Ustae forcing them to stop the bloodshed arrest one of the most notorious Ustae and disarm an Ustae detachment These atrocities were recorded in novelistic literature and poetry Malapartes Kaputt Basket of oysters chapter inspired by the widespread practices of the Ustae gouging out the eyes of Serbs Kovais Jama where Ustae tied Serbs with barbed wire and dropped them into pits Oljaas Kozara Svetinas Volii As far as the Serb population of the puppet state was concerned the stated aim was the extermination of a third of their numbers exile for another third and a forced conversion to Catholicism for yet another The Ustae succeeded in reaching their first goal exterminating close to one third of the Serbs and possibly more A Gestapo report to Himmler on increased Partisan activities stated that Increased activity of the bands is chiefly due to atrocities carried out by Ustasha units in Croatia against the Orthodox population The Ustashas committed their deeds in a bestial manner not only against males of conscript age but especially against helpless old people women and children The number of the Orthodox that the Croats have massacred and sadistically tortured to death is about three hundred thousand Pavelis regime was not officially recognized by the Vatican but at no point did the Church condemn the genocide and forced conversions to Catholicism perpetrated by the Ustae Soon after coming to power in April 1941 Paveli was given a private audience in Rome by Pope Pius XII an act for which the Pope was widely criticized A British Foreign Office memo on the subject described Pius as the greatest moral coward of our age for receiving Paveli  A Yugoslavian court declared that Paveli had been responsible for the deaths of 700000 people during his reign

In May 1945 Paveli fled via Bleiburg to Austria where he stayed for a few months before transferring to Rome where he was hidden by members of the Roman Catholic Church

Six months later he fled to South America Upon arriving in Argentina via the ratlines he became a security advisor to Juan Pern Pern issued 34000 visas to Croatians both the Nazi collaborators and the anti communists that fled from the new communist government led by Josip Broz Tito

On April 10 1957 the 16th anniversary of the founding of the Independent State of Croatia the 67 year old Paveli was shot and seriously wounded by an unknown assailant in Buenos Aires  The operation was attributed to Titos Yugoslav intelligence although the anniversary also suggested an attempt at revenge by a Chetnik activist Despite having a bullet in his spine Paveli elected not to be hospitalized Two weeks later the Argentine government agreed to the Tito governments request to extradite Paveli and he went into hiding Although there were reports that he had fled to work for the Stroessner regime in Paraguay Pavelis whereabouts remained unknown until late 1959 where it was learned that he had been granted asylum in Spain Paveli died on 28 December 1959 at the German hospital in Madrid reportedly from complications due to the bullet in his spine

The Protea is part of an ancient plant family the Proteaceae which had already divided into two subfamilies before the break up of the Gondwanaland continent about 140 million years ago Both subfamilies the Proteoideae and the Grevilleoideae occur mainly in the southern hemisphere In southern Africa there are about 360 species mainly from the subfamily Proteoideae of which more than 330 species are confined to the Cape Foral Kingdom between Nieuwoudtville in the northwest and Grahamstown in the east Protea cynaroides belongs to the genus Protea which has more than 92 species subspecies and varieties Other well known genera of the Proteaceae are the Leucospermum with the brightly coloured pincushion flowers Leucadendron with yellow or red brown foliage and Serruria of which the Serruria Florida or Blushing Bride with its pale pink flowers is widely used in bridal bouquets Plants in the subfamily Grevilleoideae occur mainly in Australia The Protea is the national flower of South Africa

The variety in plant size habit flower size and colour of the genus Protea was the reason it was named after the Greek god Proteus who could change his shape at will The flower bud of Protea cynaroides looks remarkably like the globe artichoke vegetable with the Latin name of Cynara scolymus and this led the botanist Linnaeus to give it the species name cynaroides

The protea can grow only after a fire As a simple explanation it is because the head of this national flower has seeds inside which can stay tightly sealed in a hard shell for almost 20 years The shell does not open until it becomes scorched and the fire is all over The light fluffy seeds are then blown to the ground by the wind where they all begin to grow again

Air pollution is a change in the air that can influence the health broken wikt linksurvivalsurvival or activities of organisms including humans Many of the worlds large cities today have bad air quality Even 2000 years ago the Romans were complaining about the bad air in their cities Air pollution has been for a long time a danger to human health and Earths many ecosystems

Even clean air is not really clean It has many pollutants from natural sources These pollutants include dust sea salt volcanic ashes and gases smoke from forest fires pollen and many other materials In fact there are many more natural pollutants than pollutants that human make However humans have adapted to most of these natural pollutants

Air pollutions are usually described as either primary pollutants or secondary pollutants Primary pollutants are pollutants that are put directly into the air by humans or natural sources For instance exhaust from cars broken wikt linksootsoot from smoke duststorms and ash from volcanic eruptions are all examples of primary pollutants

Secondary pollutants are pollutants that are made from chemical reactions when pollutants mix with other primary pollutants or natural substances like water vapor Many secondary pollutants are made when a primary pollutant reacts with sunlight Ozone and smog are secondary pollutants Ozone is a gas that is helpful and takes in harmful rays from the sun When it is near the ground though ozone is a dangerous pollutant that influences the health of all organisms

Human made air pollution comes from many things Most air pollution made by humans today is because of transportation Cars for instance make about 60 of the human made air pollution in the United States The gases inside car exhaust like nitrogen oxide make smog and acid rain

Many industrial power plants burn fossil fuels to get their energy But burning fossil fuels can make lots of oxides In fact the burning of fossil fuels makes 96 of the sulfur oxides in the atmosphere

Some industries also make chemicals that make poisonous fumes

Air pollution is not only on the outside Homes schools and buildings can have lots of air pollution too Sometimes the air inside a building is even worse than the air outside Many things we use every day pollute the air Compounds inside carpets paints building materials and furniture also pollute the air especially when they are new

In buildings where the windows are tightly shut to stop air leaks and so the payment for electricity will be less pollutants can be higher than outside

Air pollution is a problem everywhere in the world Local air pollution like smog usually influences big cities Air pollution becomes a worldwide worry when local pollution moves away from where it came from because of wind For example winds carry air pollution made in the middle of the western part of the United States to Canada like acid precipitation

Acid precipitation is broken wikt linkprecipitationprecipitation like rain sleet or snow that has acids from air pollution When fossil fuels are burned they let out oxides into the air When these oxides mix with water in the atmosphere they make acid which fall as precipitation Acid precipitation can kill living things like fish and trees by making the place where they live too acidic Acid rain can also damage buildings made by limestone and concrete

Other global concerns because of air pollution include the greenhouse effect and the ozone hole in the stratosphere The ozone layer in the stratosphere is supposed to protect people from the suns harmful ultraviolet rays But in the 1970s scientists found out that some chemicals let out into the atmosphere makes the ozone turn into oxygen which makes more ultraviolet rays reach the earth During the 1980s scientists found that the ozone layer above the South Pole had thinned by 50 to 98 percent

On March 17 1992 in Mexico City all children under the age of 14 could not go to school because of air pollution This does not often happen but being broken wikt linkexposeexposed to air pollution every day can make people have many health problems Children elderly people and people with allergies especially can have a lot of problems because of air pollution Studies from the University of Birmingham showed that deaths because of pneumonia and air pollution from motor vehicles like cars are related The World Health Organization said that 24 million people died because of direct problems of air pollutionSome of the problems include

Ante Starevi was a Croatian politician and publisher 

Starevi was born in itnik near Gospi a small town of the Military Frontiers in what was then part of Austria Hungary He was the son of a Serb Orthodox mother and Catholic father In 1845 he graduated from the comprehensive secondary school in Zagreb He started his studies at the seminary in Senj but moved to Pest in the year of 1845 in order to attend a Roman Catholic theological seminary  which he finished in 1848 After passing a number of philosophy and free sciences classes he earned a honoris causa degree in the year of 1846 Starevi immediately returned to Croatia and continued studying theology in Senj Rather than becoming a priest he decided to engage in secular pursuits and started working in the law firm of Ladislav ram in Zagreb 

He then tried to get an academic post with the University of Zagreb As he was unsuccessful he remained in rams office until 1861 although he was banned from practicing law in 1857 He was also a member of the committee of Matica ilirska a Croatian cultural society in the Historical Society and in the editorial board of Neven a literary magazine 

In 1861 he was appointed the chief notary of the Fiume county That same year he was elected to the Croatian Parliament as the representative of Fiume and founded the Croatian Party of Rights with Eugen Kvaternik Starevi would be reelected to the parliament in 1865 1871 and from 1878 to his death 

In 1862 when Fiume was the scene of protests against Austrian Empire he was suspended and sentenced to one month in prison as an enemy of the regime When he was released Starevi returned to rams office where he remained until 11 October 1871 when he was arrested again this time on the occasion of the Rakovica Revolt The revolt was launched by Kvaternik who was not a Serb hater as his political comrade Starevi Kvaternik had become convinced that a political solution as Starevi called for was not possible While the revolt drew several hundred men both Croats and Serbs it was soon crushed by Imperial Austrian troops The Croatian Party of Rights was abolished Starevi was released after two months in prison 

In his old age he moved to Starevi House built for him by the Party of Rights in 1895 He died in his house a year later when he was 73 According to his wish he was buried in the Church of St Mirko in the Zagreb suburb of estine His bust was made by Ivan Rendi At his deathbed he requested that no monuments be raised to his honor but his statue was put up in front of Starevi House in 1998

After being banned from practicing law in 1857 Starevi travelled to Russia where he hoped he would gather support from the empires eastern rival When this failed he travelled to France pinning his hopes on French emperor Napoleon III While in Paris he published his work La Croatie et la confdration italienne considered by some to be the precursor to his Party of Rights political program In 1859 the Austrian Empire was defeated in the Second Italian War of Independence during which time Starevi returned to Croatia Austria lost control over Italy and Austrias weakening status in the world paved the way for Starevis career 

As the chief notary in Fiume in 1861 Starevi wrote the four petitions of the Rijeka county which are considered the basis of the political program of the Croatian Party of Rights He pointed out that Croatia needed to determine its relationships with Austria and Hungary through international agreements He demanded the reintegration of the Croatian lands the large kingdom of Croatia of old the homeland of one people with the same blood language past and future

On that ideological basis he founded the Croatian Party of Rights with his school friend Eugen Kvaternik in 1861 The Party of Rights was clerical conservative and pro Habsburg Its only concession to nationalism was hostility to the Serbs who since the incorporation of the military frontiers into Croatia in 1868 made up a quarter of the population Starevi was the only parliamentary representative who agreed with Kvaterniks draft constitution of 26 June 1861 He advocated the termination of the Military Frontier and persuaded parliament to pass on 5 August 1861 the decision annulling any joint business with Austria

He advocated the resolution of Bosnian issues by reforms and cooperation between the people and the nobility Starevi believed that Bosniaks were the the best Croats and claimed that Bosnian Muslims are a part of the Croatian people and of the purest Croatian blood

Starevi wrote literary criticism short stories newspaper articles philosophical essays plays and political satire He was also a translator

His travelogue From Lika was published in Kulans magazine Slavenski Jug on 22 October 1848 He wrote four plays in the period 1851 52 but only the Village Prophet has been preserved His translation of Anacreon from Ancient Greek was published in Danica in 1853 His critical review of urevis Pjesni razlike was described by the Croatian literary historian Branko Vodnik as our first genuine literary essay about older Dubrovnik literature His opus shows an affinity with practical philosophy which he calls the science of life As Josip Horvat said His literary work from 1849 to the end of 1853 made Ante Starevi the most prolific and original Croatian writer along with Mirko Bogovi

In 1850 incited by Ljudevit Gaj Starevi started working on the manuscript of Istarski razvod a crucial Croatian document from 1325 He transcribed the text from the Glagolitic alphabet to the Latin alphabet analyzed it and published it in 1852 In the foreword young Starevi elaborated his linguistic ideas pointing out that the mixture of all three Croatian dialects and Kajkavian and the Krajina dialect is called the Croatian language which Starevi considers from the perspective of its six hundred years of history Starevi accepted the etymological orthography and used the ekavian form for his entire life considering it the heir of the old Kajkavian His language is a synthetic form of Croatian never used before or after him most similar to the Ozalj idiom of Petar Zrinski whom he probably never read 

In that period in the Call for Subscriptions to the Croatian Grammar he stated his opposition to the Vienna Language Agreement of 1850 and the linguistic concept of Vuk Stefanovi Karadi He continued his dispute with the followers of Karadi in a series of articles published in 1852 His opposition to the Vuks work he supported by utter denial of the Serbs as the nation their language their culture and history In his vain and racistic effors to oppose and derail Karadis work he was loner and loser  mainstream of the Croatian educated men headed by Strossmayer and Gaj highly appreciated and supported Karadi It was demonstrated publicly immediately after Karadis death  when Croatian Parliament collected a considerable amount of money in order to erect a monument to honor Karadi in Croatia and the Court chanchellor Ivan Maurani got the Viennese Imperial Court to financially support the Karadi widow

When Srbski dnevnik from Novi Sad published an article saying that Croatians write in Serbian Starevi wrote a fierce reply Instead of claiming that the Croats use anything else but the Croatian language those writers who consider themselves Serbs would do well to write in the educated and pure Croatian language like some of them are already doing and they can call their language Coptic for all I care He published the reply as an unsigned article in Narodne novine the newspaper of Ljudevit Gaj so the Serbian side attacked Gaj wrongly attributing the article to him Starevi subsequently proclaimed he was the author but Gaj who cared to maintain good relations with Serbia distanced himself from his friend

For his political activity and literary work Starevi is commonly called Father of the Nation in Croatia His portrait is depicted on the obverse of the Croatian 1000 Croatian kuna banknote issued in 1993

Starevi was a racist and an anti Semite His understanding of the basic human rights and the way he linked them to the civil liberties were extremely primitive and selective For example Starevi criticized the socialism as unshaped and he was delighted by the colonialism and claimed that Algeria should be densely populated by a few million of happy Frenchmen and not to allow to have one hundred fifty thousand of them against two and half million of Arabs

Starevi had based his ideological views on writings of those ancient Greek writers who thought that some people by their very nature are slaves for they had just half of the human mind and for that reason they shall be governed by people of the human nature About the people and nations which he saw as cursed and lower ranked races  he spoke as of the animal breeds and uses the breed word to mark them

He wrote a whole tractate about the Jews that could be summarized in a few sencences Jews are the breed except a few without any morality and without any homeland the breed of which every unit strives to its personal gain or to its relatives gain To let the Jews to participate in public life is dangerous throw a piece of mud in a glass of the clearest water  then all the water will be puddled That way the Jews spoiled and poisoned the French people too much

But for Starevi there was a race worst than the Jews For him the Slavoserb notion was firstly of a political nature the Slavoserbs are his political opponents who sold themselves to a foreign rule Then all those who favorably look on the South Slavs unity not regarding them as the Croats

Later and with years Starevi more and more marked the Slavoserbs as a separate ethnic group or  as he used to say the breed ranked as humans lower than the Jews The Jews are less harmful than the Slavoserbs For the Jews care for themselves and their people but the Slavoserbs are always for the evil if they cannot gain a benefit then they tend to harm the good or just affair or to harm those who are for the affair  he wrote once

Further he claimed that the injustice was done to different cursed breeds what spoiled those breeds even more and made them to be vengeful against their oppressors As a convinced racist he stresses that to the cursed breeds ie to the lower races should not be given any role in the public life

As an aged man he makes the Serbs identical to the Slavoserb breed and mocks them for their defeats they suffered long ago  which provoked negative reactions even in his Party of Rights On that occasion the Party member Erazmo Bari described Starevis mockery and racism as throwing mud at people and primitive cheeky invectives

However when once facing with negative reactions to his open racism he temporarily retreated That was a reason that he wrote an article in Sloboda issue of 23 March 1883 The main thing is this everybody should work for the people and the homeland and let them call themselves as they wish We have disputes and dissensions only because they are supported and strengthened from the outside We believe that hungry and cold Serbs and Croats feel the same Therefore everybody can assume the name of Hottentots every person can choose their own name as long as we are all free and happy

The British historian APJTaylor wrote

Starevis racism was further fully elaborated by Ivo Pilar under pseudonym L von Sdland The book was translated into Croatian language in the year of 1943 by Pavelis regime as one of the tenets of his Ustae and his Independent State of Croatia This racist work was reprinted in 1990 In the preface to this reprint edition Dr Vladimir Veselica a Zagreb University professor expresses his enthusiasm that the author had given relevant answers at the highest intellectual level What thrilled him so was the consistently expressed racist hatred against the Serbs It is sufficient to submit one quotation that explains the sense and content of this book which far outdoes the current demonization of the Serbs it was not without reason that I tried to show how the Serbs today are dangerous for their ideas and their racial composition how a bent for conspiracies revolutions and coups is in their blood

A grebe is a medium sized bird They are in the family Podicipedidae There are 22 species of grebe

Most grebes are a medium or large size Some grebes such as the Little Grebe are smaller All Grebes have large feet with lobed toes This means that each toe is separate on the foot Some grebes find it difficult to walk on land because their feet are so big They are much better at swimming and diving in water

Grebes have narrow wings Some grebes find it difficult to fly There are two species of grebe that cannot fly at all This means that if grebes are in danger they will dive under water instead of flying away like other birds do 

Grebes can have long or short bills If they eat insects in the water they will have a short bills If they eat crustaceans they will have a long sharp bill 

Most grebes are brown white and redorange They have many waterproof feathers This means they can easily float on water and dive into water without getting cold or wet In spring and summer grebes have orange crests on their heads This is so they can attract a mate Some grebes do a mating ritual This is when they dance in the water

Grebes make their nest from plants found in the water The nests float on top of the water Baby grebes can swim when they are born They are usually brown and white and do not get their orange crests until they are adults

Grebes live in freshwater Some species of grebe will go to saltwater when they are migrating This is when birds fly to live in a different place in summer or winter Grebes only migrate if they live in North America Europe or Asia Grebes in South America Africa and Asia do not migrate They are found in every continent on earth

Linguistic reductions in the English language are lost sounds in words This happens in spoken English For instance going to changes to gonna The most widely known reductions are contractions Most contractions are reductions of not For instance cannot becomes cant Many contractions are reductions between a subject and a verb For instance He is becomes Hes

Some reductions are well known to language learners for instance the reduction of a verb and to Examples are going to becoming gonna and want to becoming wanna These reductions are part of natural English They cannot be considered slang or improper

There are several basic categories of reductions

Ellision is one or more sounds left out of a word A common example is and It frequently changes to an or sometimes even n Another example is the ba sound in probably This leads to the pronunciation probly

Word stress is a weaker stress on a word The other words around it are stressed more by comparison The weakly stressed word may be blended linked or even deleted

Function words are words that signify grammatical relations They are different from content words Content words tend to carry more information They are often stressed Function words are often unstressed They may be reduced blended linked or deleted

Mangroves are trees or shrubs that grow in salty water in hot places like the tropics Mangroves make a special saltwater woodland or shrubland habitat called a mangrove swamp mangrove forest mangrove or mangal Mangroves grow on 13 of tropical shores They are also found in sub tropical Africa Asia and the southwest Pacific Their twisted tangled roots collect dirt which often become islands

Mangroves live right in the water Their seeds fall from the tree and will grow roots as soon as they touch any kind of soil During low tide they may fall in soil rather than water and start growing where they fell If the water level is high though they can be carried far away from where they fell Mangrove trees are often the beginning of what will one day be a small island As dirt and other things collect in their roots little bodies of land are formed just the right place for other island vegetation to grow This is an example of seed dispersal by water

Sometimes mangrove trees grow on a coral reef and keep them healthy Smaller roots designed with air passages and breathing pores move oxygen from the air to parts of the plant underwater Mangrove roots give clear water to the coral by trapping dirt and clean water by filtering land runoff and removing pollutants The tree also protects the shoreline from being eroded by storm waves Mangrove thickets are a good place for many coral reef fish shrimp and crabs to grow

Population sans doubles comptes is a phrase in French that means Population without double counting in English

In France because of the census the INSEE has allowed people who live in one place and study in a different place to be counted twice so as to show how the population moves Because of this each commune in France has many numbers of how many people live in it For example students may be counted where they study and where they live but do not study It is just like allowing students in the United States to vote in the town election of the place they are studying in and the town election where they were born

Uncle Toms Cabin or Life Among the Lowly is an anti slavery novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe It greatly influenced many peoples thoughts about African Americans and slavery in the United States It also strengthened the conflict between the Northern and Southern United States This led to the American Civil War The books effect was so powerful that Lincoln said when he met Stowe at the beginning of the Civil War So this is the little lady who made this big war

The main character of the novel is Uncle Tom a patient black slave The sentimental novel showed the effects of slavery It also said that Christian love is stronger than slavery

Uncle Toms Cabin was the most popular novel of the 19th century and the second best selling book of the century It helped abolitionism spread in the 1850s

In these days it has been praised as a very important help to anti slavery However it has also been criticized for making stereotypes about black people

Harriet Beecher Stowe was born in Connecticut She was an abolitionist Stowe wrote her novel because of the 1850 passage of the second Fugitive Slave Act This law punished people who helped slaves run away It also made the North stop and return the Souths black runaways Mrs Edward Beecher wrote to Harriet If I could use a pen as you can I would write something that will make this whole nation feel what an accursed thing slavery is At that time Stowe was a wife with six children who sometimes wrote for magazines Her son Charles Stowe said that his mother read this letter out loud to her children When she finished the letter she stood up and with an expression on her face that stamped itself on the mind of her child she said I will write somethingI will if I live That is how Uncle Toms Cabin began

According to Stowe she began thinking about Uncle Toms Cabin or Life Among the Lowly as she was in a church in February 1851 She had a vision of a Christian black man being beaten and praying for the people who were beating him as he died She was also partly inspired to write her novel by the autobiography of Josiah Henson Henson was a black man who had run away and helped many black slaves She was also helped by the book American Slavery As It Is Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses by Theodore Dwight Weld and the Grimk sisters Stowe also said that she got lots of ideas for Uncle Toms Cabin by talking to runaway slaves when she was living in Cincinnati Ohio

In her book A Key to Uncle Toms Cabin Stowe wrote about the stories that inspired her when she was writing Uncle Toms Cabin However later research showed that Stowe did not actually read many of the stories inside the book until after her novel was published

Uncle Toms Cabin began in a series in an anti slavery newspaper The National Era The National Era had also printed other works Stowe had written Because everybody liked the story so much John P Jewett of Boston asked Stowe to turn the serial into a book Stowe was not sure if people would like to read the story as a book However she finally agreed John Jewett sure that the book would be popular asked Hammatt Billings to engrave six pictures for the book In March 20 1852 the finished book came out By June it was selling ten thousand copies a week By October American sales alone were 150 thousand copies In the first year it was published 300000 copies of the book were sold and it was translated into many important languages

A Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby is afraid of losing his farm because of debts Even though he and his wife Emily Shelby are kind to their slaves he decides to sell two of them Uncle Tom a middle aged man with a wife and children and Harry the son of his wifes maid Eliza Emily Shelby is shocked and unhappy because she promised Eliza that she would not sell her son George Shelby her son is unhappy because he admires Uncle Tom as his friend and Christian

When Eliza hears about Mr Shelbys plans to sell her son she decides to run away with her only son She writes a letter saying sorry to Mrs Shelby and runs away that night

Meanwhile Uncle Tom is sold and put into a boat which sails down the Mississippi River There he makes friends with a girl called Evangeline When Eva falls into the water and he saves her Evas father Augustine St Clare buys Tom Eva and Tom become good friends because they both love Jesus very deeply

During Elizas escape she meets her husband George Harris who had run away before her They decide to try to run away to Canada However they are hunted by a slave hunter named Tom Loker Tom Loker finally traps Eliza and her family so that George shoots Loker Eliza is worried that Loker might die and go to hell Because of this she persuades her husband to take him to a Quaker town to get better The gentle Quakers change Tom Loker greatly

In St Clares house St Clare argues with his sister Miss Ophelia She thinks that slavery is wrong but is prejudiced against blacks St Clare buys Topsy a black child and challenges Miss Ophelia to educate her Miss Ophelia tries but fails

After Tom has lived with St Clare for about two years Eva becomes very sick She has a vision of heaven before she dies Because of her death many people change Miss Ophelia loses her prejudice of black people Tospy decides to become good and St Clare decides to free Tom

St Clare however is hurt when he tries to stop a fight at a tavern and dies Because of this he cannot keep his promise to free Tom His wife sells Tom to a plantation owner named Simon Legree Legree takes Tom to Louisiana There he meets other slaves including Emmeline Legree begins to hate Tom when Tom disobeys his order to whip the other slaves Legree beats him and decides to destroy Toms faith in God However Tom secretly continues to read the Bible and help the other slaves At the plantation Tom meets Cassy another black slave Her two children had been sold and she had killed her third child because she was afraid that her child would be sold too

Loker has been changed because of the Quakers George Eliza and Harry have finally reached Canada and become free Meanwhile Uncle Tom feels so unhappy that he almost gives up but he has two visions of Jesus and Eva He decides to continue to be a Christian even if he has to die Cassy and Emmeline with Toms encouragement run away They cleverly use Legrees superstitious fears to help them When Tom does not tell Legree where they are Legree tells his men to beat him to death Tom forgives the two men who beat him as he dies and they feel sorry and become Christians George Shelby comes just as Tom is dying to free him He is very angry and sad However Tom saying smilingly Whowhowho shall separate us from the love of Christ dies

Uncle Tom the title character of the story is a patient noble unselfish black slave Stowe wanted him to be a noble hero in the book he stands up for what he believes in Even though they do not want to even his enemies admire him

Recently however his name has also been used negatively People often think of Uncle Tom as an old black man trying to make his masters happy as people have criticized his quiet acceptance of slavery However others argue that this is not true First of all Uncle Tom is not really old  he is only eight years older than Mr Shelby which shows that he is probably around fifty Also Tom is not happy with slavery His acceptance is not because of stupidity or because he likes slavery It is because of his religious faith which tells him to love everyone Wherever Uncle Tom goes he loves and spreads comfort and kindness He helps slaves escape such as Eliza Emmeline and Cassy He also refuses to beat other slaves Because of this he is beaten himself Stowe was not trying to make Tom an example for blacks but for white and black people She says that if white people were to be loving and unselfish like Uncle Tom slavery would be impossible

Eliza Harris is Mrs Shelbys favorite maid George Harris wife and Harrys mother Eliza is a brave intelligent and very beautiful young slave Eliza loves her son Harry very much It is possible her love for him was even greater because she lost two of her first infant children Her motherly love is shown when she bravely escapes with her son Perhaps the most well known part of Uncle Toms Cabin is the part where Eliza escapes on the Ohio River with Harry

This escape is said to have been inspired by a story heard in the Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati by John Rankin to Stowes husband Calvin a professor at the school In Rankins story in February 1838 a young slave woman had escaped across the frozen Ohio River to the town of Ripley Ohio with her child in her arms and stayed at his house before she had gone further towards the north

Eva Evangeline St Clare is St Clare and Maries angelic daughter She enters the story when Tom saves her from drowning when he was going to be sold Eva asks her father to buy Tom She says I want to make him happy Through her Tom becomes St Clares leading coachman and Evas especial attendantTom hadorders to let everything else go and attend to Miss Eva whenever she wanted himorders which our readers may fancy were far from disagreeable to him She is very beautiful Her form was the perfection of childish beautyHer face was remarkable less for its perfect beauty of features than for a singular and dreamy earnestness of expressionall marked her out from the other children and made every one turn and look after her

To Tom she seemed something almost divine and whenever her golden head and deep blue eyes peered out upon himhe half believed that he saw one of the angels stepped out of his New Testament He says that Shes got the Lords mark in her forehead Eva is an almost perfect Christ like child She is very sad about slavery She does not see the difference between blacks and whites She talks very much about love and forgiveness Even Topsy is touched by her love Eva becomes one of the most important people in Toms life

Ophelia St Clare is perhaps the most complicated female character in the novel St Clare calls her desperately good it tires me to death to think of it She does not like slavery However she does not like to be touched or come close to any black person as a human being When she first saw Eva shaking hands and kissing with the blacks she declared that it had fairly turned her stomach She adds I want to be kind to everybody and I wouldnt have anything hurt but as to kissingHow can she

She has a clear strong active mind and is very practical However she has a warm heart which she shows in her love for St Clare and Eva Ophelia hates slavery but has a deep prejudice against blacks St Clare as a challenge to her buys Topsy He tells her to try educating her At first she tries to teach and help Topsy simply because of duty However Stowe says that duty is not enough there must be love Evas death changes Ophelia When Topsy cries She said she loved methere ant nobody left now Ophelia gently says as honest tears fell down her face Topsy you poor childI can love you though I am not like that dear little child I hope Ive learnt something of the love of Christ from her I can love youand Ill try to help you to grow up a good Christian girl Stowe thought that there were many people like Miss Ophelia St Clare who did not like slavery but could not think of blacks as people She wanted to write about such problems through Miss Ophelia

Uncle Toms Cabins most important theme is the evil of slavery Every part in Uncle Toms Cabin develops the characters and the story But most importantly it always tries to show the reader that slavery is evil un Christian and should not be allowed One way Stowe showed the evil of slavery was how it forced families from each other

Stowe thought mothers were the model for all of American life She also believed that only women could save the United States from slavery Because of this another very important theme of Uncle Toms Cabin is the moral power and sanctity of women White women like Mrs Bird St Clares mother Legrees mother and Mrs Shelby try to make their husbands help their slaves Eva who is the ideal Christian says that blacks and whites are the same Black women like Eliza are brave and pious She escapes from slavery to save her son and by the end of the novel has made her whole family come together again Some critics said that Stowes female characters are often unrealistic However Stowes novel made many people remember the importance of womens influence and helped the womens rights movement later

Stowes puritanical religious beliefs are also one of the biggest themes in the novel She explores what Christianity is like She believed that the most important thing in Christianity was love for everyone She also believed that Christian theology shows that slavery is wrong This theme can be seen when Tom urges St Clare to look away to Jesus after St Clares daughter Eva dies After Tom dies George Shelby says What a thing it is to be a Christian Because Christian themes are so important and because Stowe often directly spoke in the novel about religion and faith the novel is written in the form of a sermon

Uncle Toms Cabin is written in a sentimental and melodramatic style This style was often used in the 19th century sentimental novel and domestic fiction These genres were the most popular novels of Stowes time It usually had female characters and a style that made readers feel sympathy and emotion for them Stowes novel is different from other sentimental novels because she writes about a large theme like slavery It is also different because she has a man as the main character However she still tried to make her readers have strong feelings when they read Uncle Toms Cabin like making them cry when Eva died This kind of writing made readers react powerfully For instance Georgiana May a friend of Stowes wrote a letter to the writer In the letter she said that I was up last night long after one oclock reading and finishing Uncle Toms Cabin I could not leave it any more than I could have left a dying child Another reader said that she thought about the book all the time and even thought about changing her daughters name to Eva The death of Eva affected lots of people In 1852 300 baby girls in Boston were named Eva

Even though many readers were very moved literary critics did not like the style in Uncle Toms Cabin and other sentimental novels They said these books were written by women and had womens sloppy emotions One literary critic said that if the novel not been about slavery it would be just another sentimental novel Another said the book was a piece of hack work In The Literary History of the United States George F Whicher called Uncle Toms Cabin Sunday school fiction 

However in 1985 Jane Tompkins wrote differently about Uncle Toms Cabin in her book In Sensational Designs The Cultural Work of American Fiction Tompkins praised Uncle Toms Cabins style She said that sentimental novels showed how womens emotions changed the world in a good way She also said that the popular domestic novels written in the 19th century like Uncle Toms Cabin were intelligently written She also said that Uncle Toms Cabin shows a critique of American society far more devastating than any by better known critics such as Hawthorne and Melville

Uncle Toms Cabin has had a very great influence There are not many novels in history that changed society so powerfully When it was published Uncle Toms Cabin people who defended slavery were very angry and protested against it Some people even wrote books against it Abolitionists praised it very much As a best seller the novel greatly influenced later protest literature

As soon as it was published Uncle Toms Cabin made people in the American South very angry The novel was also greatly criticized by people who supported slavery

A famous novelist from the South William Gilmore Simms said that the book was not true Others called the novel criminal and said it was full of lies A person who sold books in Mobile Alabama had to leave town for selling the novel Stowe received threatening letters She even received a package with a slaves cut ear once Many Southern writers like Simms soon began writing their own books about slavery

Some critics said that Stowe had never actually went to a Southern plantation and she did not know much about Southern life They said that because of this she made wrong descriptions about the South However Stowe always said she made the characters of her book by stories she was told by slaves that ran away to Cincinnati Ohio where she lived It is reported She observed firsthand several incidents which inspired her to write the famous anti slavery novel Scenes she observed on the Ohio River including seeing a husband and wife being sold apart as well as newspaper and magazine accounts and interviews contributed material to the plot

In 1853 Stowe published A Key to Uncle Toms Cabin This was to show the people who had criticized the novels description of slavery that it was true In the book Stowe writes about the important characters in Uncle Toms Cabin and about people in real life who were like them Through this book she writes a more aggressive attack on slavery in the South than the novel itself had Like the novel A Key to Uncle Toms Cabin was also a best seller However many of the works in A Key to Uncle Toms Cabin was read by Stowe after she published her novel

Even though there were such criticisms the novel was still very popular Stowes son says that when Abraham Lincoln met her in 1862 Lincoln said So this is the little lady who started this great war Historians are not sure if Lincoln really said this or not In a letter that Stowe wrote to her husband a few hours after meeting with Lincoln she does not say anything about this sentence After this many writers have said that this novel helped make the North angry at slavery and at the Fugitive Slave Law It greatly helped the abolitionist movement Union general and politician James Baird Weaver said that the book made him help in the abolitionist movement

Uncle Toms Cabin also interested many people in England The first London edition came out in May 1852 It sold 200000 copies Some of this interest was because at that time the British people did not like America A writer said The evil passions which Uncle Tom gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance of slavery but national jealousy and national vanity We have long been smarting under the conceit of America we are tired of hearing her boast that she is the freest and the most enlightened country that the world has ever seen Our clergy hate her voluntary system our Tories hate her democrats our Whigs hate her All parties hailed Mrs Stowe as a revolter from the enemy Charles Francis Adams the American minister to Britain during the war said later that Uncle Toms Cabin or Life among the Lowly published in 1852 influenced the world more quickly powerfully and dramatically than any other book ever printed

The book has been translated into almost every language For example it was translated into Chinese Its translator Lin Shu made this the first Chinese translation of an American novel It was also translated into Amharic Its 1930 translation was made to help Ethiopia end the suffering of blacks in that nation The book was read by so many people that Sigmund Freud believed that some of his patients had been influenced by reading about the whipping of slaves in Uncle Toms Cabin

Uncle Toms Cabin was the first widely read political novel in the United States It greatly influenced American literature and protest literature Some later books that were greatly influenced by Uncle Toms Cabin are The Jungle by Upton Sinclair and Silent Spring by Rachel Carson

However even though Uncle Toms Cabin was very important many people thought the book was a mix of childrens fable and propaganda Many critics called the book merely a sentimental novel George Whicher wrote in his Literary History of the United States that Nothing attributable to Mrs Stowe or her handiwork can account for the novels enormous vogue its authors resources of Sunday school fiction were not remarkable melodrama humor and pathos compounded her book

Other critics though have praised the novel Edmund Wilson said that To expose oneself in maturity to Uncle Toms Cabin may prove a startling experience Jane Tompkins said that the novel is one of the classics of American literature She suggested that literary critics think badly of the book because it was simply too popular when it came out

Through the years people have wondered what Stowe was trying to say with the novel Some of her themes can be seen easily like the evil of slavery However some themes are harder to see For example Stowe was a Christian and active abolitionist and put lots of her religious beliefs in her book Some have said that Stowe wrote in her novel what she thought was a solution to the problem that worried many people who did not like slavery This problem was was doing things that were not allowed justified if they did it to fight evil Was it right to use violence to stop the violence of slavery Was breaking laws that helped slavery right Which of Stowes characters should be followed the patient Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris Stowe thought that Gods will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them

People have also thought Uncle Toms Cabin expressed the ideas of the Free Will Movement In this idea the character of George Harris symbolizes the free labor The complex character of Ophelia shows the Northerners who allowed slavery even though they did not like it Dinah is very different from Ophelia She acts by passion In the book Ophelia changes Like Ophelia the Republican Party declared that the North must change itself It said that the North must stop slavery actively

Feminist theory can also be seen in Stowes book The novel can be seen as criticizing slaverys patriarchal nature For Stowe families were related by blood not by family like relations between masters and slaves Stowe also saw the nation as a bigger family So the feelings of nationality came from sharing the same race Because of this she supported the idea that freed slaves should live together in a colony

The book has also been seen as trying to show that masculinity was important in stopping slavery Abolitionists began to change the way they thought of violent men They wanted men to help stop slavery without hurting their self image or their position in society Because of this some abolitionists followed some of the principles of womens suffrage peace and Christianity They praised men for helping working together and having mercy Other abolitionists were more traditional they wanted men to act more forcefully All the men in Stowes book show either patient men or traditional men

Recently some people have begun criticizing the book for what they thought were racist descriptions of the books black characters They criticized the way Stowe wrote about the characters looks speech behavior and the passive nature of Uncle Tom The books use of common stereotypes about African Americans is important because Uncle Toms Cabin was the best selling novel in the world in the 19th century Because of this the book helped make a great number of people accept such stereotypes

Among the African American stereotypes in Uncle Toms Cabin are

These stereotypes made many people think much more lightly of the historical importance of Uncle Toms Cabin as a vital antislavery tool This change in the way people looked at Uncle Toms Cabin began in an essay by James Baldwin This essay was titled Everybodys Protest Novel In the essay Baldwin called Uncle Toms Cabin a very bad novel He said it was not well written

In the 1960s and 70s the Black Power and Black Arts Movements strongly criticized the book They said that the character of Uncle Tom was a part of race betrayal They said that Tom made slaves look worse than slave owners Criticisms of the other stereotypes in the book also increased during this time

However people such as Henry Louis Gates Jr have begun studying Uncle Toms Cabin again He says that the book is a central document in American race relations and a significant moral and political exploration of the character of those relations

Hurricane Ida was the last storm in the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season It formed in the southwestern Caribbean on November 4 after being in that area for a few days After becoming a depression it quickly got stronger and became a tropical storm and a hurricane shortly before it struck Nicaragua Over Central America Hurricane Ida weakened very fast becoming downgraded to a tropical depression before the end of the day on November 5

By November 6 Ida went back into the Caribbean and later became a hurricane again Its strength changed a few times before it died on November 10 off the coast of Alabama Reports show that Hurricane Ida caused 56 million in damage and caused 2 deaths

Ida was tracked back to a tropical wave that entered the western Caribbean Sea on November 1 A low soon formed near the tropical wave This low did not move very much and it also got a lot of clouds near the middle of it There was hardly any wind shear which allowed for more clouds to form 

On November 4 the tropical wave National Hurricane Center began call it Tropical Depression Eleven The new tropical depression quickly got stronger and became Tropical Storm Ida soon after that An Aircraft went into Ida and soon found winds at 65 miles per hour which meant it was nearly a hurricane 

Continuing to the northwest Tropical Storm Ida was upgraded to Hurricane Ida when winds got to 80 miles per hour at the time it was put at only 75 miles per hour Soon after this Hurricane Ida made landfall in Nicaragua on November 5 Ida weakened quickly over land and was downgraded to a tropical storm just after landfall Near the end of the day on November 5 Tropical Storm Ida weakened to a tropical depression 

Tropical Depression Ida survived its passage over land and went back into the Caribbean on November 6 Over the western Caribbean it quickly became a tropical storm again After moving north Tropical Storm Ida became a hurricane again It reached its highest winds on November 8 while it crossed between Cuba and Mexico they were measured at 105 miles per hour making it a category 2 hurricane Water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico were not warm enough to keep Ida at this strength so it quickly weakened back to a tropical storm 

For only six hours it became a hurricane again before it became extratropical on November 10 while it was just south of Alabama At the time it looked like it stayed as a tropical storm and made landfall in Alabama this was later noted as incorrect Its remnants formed a strong noreaster that affected some of the states of the East Coast of the United States

Damage in Nicaragua was near 21 million and there was not people killed In El Salvador it seemed at first that killed over 100 people this was discovered as a mistake later on

Because the couch is usually set in front of the TV it is the main place where people usually sit and watch it Lazy people would eventually seem to be stuck to it all the time This person a person who does not do a lot of physical activity was called a couch potato This was also because potatoes do not move at all and does not do anything but just sits there This may also be considered as slang Couch came from the word couche which means a bed lair or from the word coucher which means to lie down

Giacomo Meyerbeer was a famous German born opera composer He was the most important composer of French Grand opera during the 1830s and 1840s Although he was tremendously popular in his day his music is not often played now

Meyerbeer was born into a rich Jewish family in Tasdorf near Berlin His father owned large sugar refineries in Berlin and in Italy His mother also came from a wealthy family Her father had been important in Germanys struggle to be free of the French in 1812 when Napoleon was trying to conquer much of Europe Giacomos mother did a lot of good work trying to help people who were wounded during the war 

A lot of famous people came to the house where Giacomos family lived Some of their friends were from the royal Prussian court including the future King Friedrich Wilhelm IV The naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt also visited them quite often

Meyerbeers first piano teacher was Franz Lauska who also taught the royal princes He also had lessons in composition Meyerbeer first played in public in 1801 playing Mozarts Piano Concerto in D Minor in Berlin He wrote his first opera in 1810 In the same year he went to Darmstadt to study with the well known music theorist Abb Vogler There he met the young Carl Maria von Weber who was also a pupil of Vogler He left Vogler in 1811 and tried to get some work in Munich In 1813 he found he had been offered a job as court composer to the Grand Duke of Hessen Vogler had probably recommended him for the job At this time Meyerbeer was better known as a pianist than as a composer He travelled to London to hear JBCramer There he met other famous pianists such as Kalkbrenner and Ferdinand Ries

In 1816 Meyerbeer went to Italy He wanted to learn about Italian opera and collect Italian folksongs He was going to stay three months but he stayed nine years He made some trips back to Germany and Austria during this time He composed several operas which became very popular People started to compare him with the famous Rossini However in Germany people were not interested in his music He took his opera Il crociato in Egitto to London and then to Paris where it was an immediate success The opera is remembered now for being the last opera ever to have a part for a castrato singer 

He was becoming well known now Spontini asked him to compose an opera for Berlin He became friends in Paris with the librettist Eugne Scribe who had a lot of influence in the French theatre 

From 1825 onwards Meyerbeer spent his life travelling about Europe He was often in Paris and in Berlin but did not live in either of these places He stayed in hotels or private houses wherever he went One reason why he travelled was because of his health His wife also had bad health so they often went to spa towns to try to get better He also travelled about to watch productions of his operas and to hear young singers

When Carl Maria von Weber died he left an opera Die drei Pintos unfinished It was sent to Meyerbeer in the hope that he would finish it but he did not seem interested In the end Gustav Mahler finished it many years later

Meyerbeer made changes to Il crociato in Egitto and turned it into a grand opera for the Opra in Paris He changed it from an Italian to a French opera composing extra dance music and a new overture He was determined to be famous in Paris

In 1826 he married his cousin They had two children but they both died when they were very small

In 1828 Auber had composed a very successful opera called La muette de Portici It was the first French grand opera Meyerbeer realized he could not become really popular by turning his Italian operas into French grand opera so he took his comic opera Robert le Diable and changed it into a grand opera It is probably the best opera Meyerbeer ever wrote Within three years it had been performed in 77 theatres in 10 different countries Many composers made their own arrangements of some of the tunes from the opera  He was given many honours the Chevalier of the Legion dhonneur the title of Prussian Hof Kapellmeister and was made a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts and a member of the French Institute 

Meyerbeer realized that anything else he wrote would have to be really good In 1836 he produced another opera Les Huguenots 

In 1842 he went to Boulogne to improve his health There he met Richard Wagner who asked him for financial help to stage his operas Rienzi and The Flying Dutchman Meyerbeer lent him money but stopped giving him money when he heard that Wagner was secretly criticizing him

When Spontini died Meyerbeer was made Generalmusikdirektor in Berlin His opera Les Huguenots had been forbidden in Germany but now it was allowed to be performed As court composer he wrote a grand opera called Ein Feldschlag in Schlesien but it was too patriotic ever to become internationally famous The main part in the opera was sung by Jenny Lind

In 1849 he returned to Paris where he had fewer enemies than in Germany He wrote several works together with Scribe whom Meyerbeer described as the best librettist of comic opera His opera Le prophte was a huge success and earned him a lot of money The great contralto Pauline Viardot Garcia sang the main part

Scribe died in 1861 Meyerbeer worked very hard to try to finish his opera Lafricaine Napoleon III said he wanted it to be performed by the winter of 1862 63 but he did not finish it until 1864 The work was being rehearsed for its first performance when Meyerbeer suddenly died

Meyerbeers body was taken to Berlin where it was buried in the Jewish cemetery in a vault that belonged to his family

Meyerbeer was always more popular in France than in Germany His operas are about the society of wealthy people The sounds he made with his orchestra are often deliberately unbeautiful in order to show the harshness of real life In this he is like Beethoven in his final years and Berlioz He sometimes used new instruments such as the bass clarinet and the saxophone He always thought carefully about what his singers were capable of when writing his music He enjoyed working with different singers among them Velluti who was the last of the great operatic castrati He thought carefully about how to give his singers rests during the opera so that they would still be in good voice for the climax of the story He liked scenes with large crowds He composed his dance music very carefully and would often throw it away and start again if the dancers were not happy with it

Besides his operas he also wrote orchestral pieces for special occasions He also wrote some songs for performance in the salon

Meyerbeer was one of the richest men in Europe This is why some people hated him

Meyerbeers operas were very popular in the middle of the 19th century but by the end of the century they had gone out of fashion In the 20th century his music was banned by the Nazis because the composer was Jewish Today there is some interest again but nothing like the huge popularity he had in his lifetime

Grand Opera is a term which is used to describe an opera with continuous music It is a kind of opera that was popular in the 19th century Grand operas are usually divided into four or five acts There have large casts and large orchestras There is a lot of scenery The story is dramatic It is usually a story about a hero from history The term Grand Opera has often been used to describe the Paris Opra from the late 1820s to around 1850 and sometimes to describe the Paris Opra itself 

In a broader sense Grand Opera can be any large scale opera from European countries During the 1830s and 1840s Giacomo Meyerbeer was thought to be the greatest composer of Grand Opera

Die Feen is an opera in three acts by Richard Wagner The German libretto was written by the composer He was adapting a story by Carlo Gozzi called La donna serpente

Die Feen was the first opera that Wagner finished However it was never performed during his lifetime It has never become popular although the overture is sometimes played The music shows the influence of Carl Maria von Weber and other composers of the time It also shows some musical ideas that Wagner was to develop later in his life in his famous operas The fairy tale atmosphere in the story is also an idea that he uses in his later operas which deal with fantasy stories The idea of being saved is also an important idea that he used in later operas

Rienzi is an opera by Richard Wagner Its full title is Rienzi der Letzte der Tribunen It is one of the earliest operas Wagner wrote There are five acts Wagner wrote the libretto himself using the story from a novel by Edward Bulwer Lytton It was composed between 1838 and 1840 It was first performed at the Hofoper Dresden on 20 October 1842 It was the first time Wagner had a success as an opera composer

The story of the opera is set in Rome and is based on the life of Cola di Rienzi a medieval Italian populist figure who manages to trick the nobles and their followers He helps the people to get power At first he is very popular but then he has to use force against the nobles and the Church turns against him In the end the ordinary people burn the Capitol where Rienzi and his friends are sheltering

Der fliegende Hollnder is an opera by Richard Wagner Wagner wrote the libretto himself The story comes from the legend of the Flying Dutchman which is about the captain of a ship It is his fate that he has keep sailing the sea without ever going on to land until Judgment Day

The most important idea in the story as told by Wagner is redemption through love It was a favourite idea of Wagner who used it a lot in his later operas

Wagner conducted the first performance at the Semper Oper in Dresden in 1843 It is an early opera of Wagner but it shows his mature style It is very different from the previous opera Rienzi which is still quite similar to operas that other composers were writing In Der fliegende Hollnder the drama is very important Wagner uses a number of leitmotifs musical ideas associated with particular characters and themes in the story The leitmotifs are all introduced in the overture We hear the famous leitmotif of the ocean and then those of the Dutchman and of Senta the girl he falls in love with

Wagner originally wrote Der fliegende Hollnder to be performed without any breaks Sometimes it is performed like that today but Wagner also made a version with three acts

Tannhuser is an opera by Richard Wagner The full title is Tannhuser und der Sngerkrieg auf Wartburg It is divided into three acts As usual Wagner wrote the libretto himself

The story is based on the historical character of Tannhuser about whom very little is known except the myths about him It is also about the myth of Venus but it also deals with the medieval Minnesinger 

Half of the opera takes place in a historical setting and half takes place in the mythological Venusberg

It was first performed in Dresden in 1845

Ladys slipper orchids lady slipper orchids or slipper orchids are the orchids in the subfamily Cypripedioidea They are special because of the broken wikt linkslipperslipper shaped orchid pouches of the flowers The pouch traps insects so that they must climb up past the broken wikt linkstaminodestaminode where they get or give pollen fertilizing the flower

Some people think this subfamily should be different from the Orchidacae as a family Cypripediaceae

A lady slipper orchid has a deep pocket that is actually a bee trap When a bee crawls down into the flower to get the nectar the pocket on the flower closes shut Because of this the bee is stuck for a while wiggling and squirming getting pollen all over itself The bee finally finds a small opening near the top of the orchid and it gets out so that it can get trapped inside another lady slipper where it will give that pollen to the other lady slippers stigma

The ladys slipper is also known in the United States of America as the moccasin flower because it looks like a shoe or broken wikt linkmoccasinmoccasin

Fire ants are stinging ants They are also called ginger ants and tropical fire ants They evolved in South America but have become a major pest in North America They are known for a painful sting This sting uses a base not an acid

In 1918 fire ants were accidentally moved into the United States of America by a ship from South America They were moved in large amounts of dirt The ships brought heavy things like machines from the US to South America They brought back light things like crops The dirt was used to make the ships weigh more The dirt sometimes had fire ants in it In the United States fire ants have no natural predators or competitors Native animals are not adapted to these ants Fire ants are very aggressive Their colonies can have many queens unlike many other ant species Because of this fire ants have spread very fast By 1965 fire ant broken wikt linkmoundmounds came up on the south eastern coast and as far west as Texas Today they are found in at least 10 southern states There is a separate group of fire ants living in California

Fire ants have done a lot of harm as they have spread across the United States Because they are attracted to electrical currents they chew through wires This makes shorts in electrical broken wikt linkcircuitcircuits Fire ants have also disturbed the natural balance of native ecosystems In some places they have killed off 70 of the native ant species and 40 of other native insect species

Each year about 25000 people go for medical help because of painful bites from fire ants Fire ants attack in groups when disturbed People often get many bites Fire ant bites are usually not dangerous Some people are allergic to fire ants They may go into shock This is called anaphylaxis This can kill them

The fire ants are growing in the US 80 years after they came there About 157 chemicals like ammonia gasoline parts of manure and insect killing pesticides are used against fire ants However none of them were very helpful By 1995 the government had allowed only one fire ant bait for people to use a lot

The Musical Offering BWV 1079 is a collection of several pieces of music by Johann Sebastian Bach It consists of canons fugues ricercars and a trio sonata All the music is based on a tune made up by King Frederick II of Prussia Bach dedicated the work to him

The idea for this music started at a meeting between Bach and Frederick II on 7 May 1747 One of Bachs sons Carl Philipp Emanuel was one of the kings court musicians The king wanted to show Johann Sebastian Bach a new instrument that had recently been invented This was the piano The king invited Bach to his palace at Potsdam

During the visit the king gave Bach a theme and asked him to write a 3 part fugue based on it Bach was good at improvisation so he made up a 3 part fugue The king wondered whether he could make up a 6 part fugue That would be very difficult and people thought he was joking but Bach said he would think about it

Two months later after he had gone home to Leipzig Bach made up a six voice fugue based on the kings theme He put it together with other compositions based on the theme and sent them to the king This music became known as the Musical Offering We do not know what the king thought of it

At the top of the music Bach wrote some Latin words Regis Iussu Cantio Et Reliqua Canonica Arte Resoluta The first letters of these words spell out the word ricercar which was a form of music well known at the time

The Musical Offering consists of a collection of ricercars canons fugues and a trio sonata The trio sonata was written for flute violin and basso continuo but most of the other music does not show what instruments should play it They are often played on keyboard instruments or as chamber music by small groups of instruments Bach did not show what order he wanted the pieces to be played in

Bach also put riddles at the top of some of the pieces Some of these riddles have been explained but some have more than one solution One of these riddle canons in augmentationem ie augmentation has notes which get longer and longer Bach wrote Notulis crescentibus crescat Fortuna Regis Another one is a modulating canon which ends a tone higher than it starts Bach wrote over the music Ascendenteque Modulationis ascendat Gloria Regis

Several composers have made arrangements of some of the music from the Musical Offering In 1935 Anton Webern arranged Bachs six part ricercar for orchestra In 1980 Sofia Gubaidulina used the Royal Theme of the Musical Offering in her violin concerto She turns the notes into a Russian Orthodox hymn

Dedication can mean the act of consecrating a religious building such as a temple or church

The Mycenaean culture was an early Greek culture during the Bronze age on the Greek mainland and on Crete 

The name Achaean was used by Homer to describe them and occurs in the Iliad The term we use is derived from Mycenae which is an important archaeological site about 90km from Athens Other important Mycenaean sites are at Athens Thebes Tiryns and Pylos The epic poems of Homer the Iliad and the Odyssey are Mycenaean in origin Quite unlike the Minoans whose society benefited from trade the Mycenaeans advanced through conquest

Mycenaean is the most ancient known form of the Greek language It was spoken on the Greek mainland and on Crete in the Mycenaean period 16th to 12th centuries BC The language is preserved in inscriptions in Linear B a script first known on Crete before the 14th century BC Most instances of these inscriptions are on clay tablets found in Knossos in central Crete and in Pylos in the southwest of the Peloponnese Other tablets have been found at Mycenae itself Tiryns and Thebes and at Chania in Western Crete 

The tablets remained long undeciphered and every conceivable language was suggested for them until Michael Ventris deciphered the script in 1952 He presented evidence which showed the language was an early form of Greek

The texts on the tablets are mostly lists and inventories No prose narrative survives much less myth or poetry Nevertheless they give us some idea of the people who produced them By the late thirteenth century BC mainland Greece witnessed a wave of destruction The Mycenaean sites declined and the people withdrew to refuge settlements This is the so called Greek Dark Ages little or no writing is found until the 8th century BC See Ancient Greece for this and later periods

Manna sometimes spelled mana is the name of a food which according to the Bible the Israelites ate while they were traveling 40 years in the desert after leaving Egypt which God provided because they had nothing to eat Every morning they would gather the white flakes that covered the ground It is said to have a sweet taste When they got tired of manna God gave them quail

One day a phrenologist visiting the Barton household told Bartons parents to teach in a school so she could overcome her extreme shyness Barton was first terrified of this but she soon taught a class of forty girls and boys in a local school Barton impressed the children who were barely younger than she was and she felt happy at earning their respect After her school received an award for discipline Barton received many job offers She asked for and received the same pay for teaching as male teachers which was uncommon at the time Barton taught at the school for ten years

When she was thirty Barton enrolled at the Clinton Liberal Institute in New York After graduating two schoolmates Charles and Mary Norton invited her to live with their family in Hightstown New Jersey Barton began teaching in the local school and then began starting free public schools like the ones in Massachusetts The school was very successful and many new teachers were hired and a new building was built A man was hired to run the school and he received a salary almost twice as high as Bartons salary Barton was angry at this treatment and she left to find a new job in Washington DC

A phase change is the process by which forms of matter are altered For example when a solid melts and becomes a liquid it goes through a phase change A few more examples solid to gas sublimation gas to liquid condensation liquid to solid solidification gas to solid deposition and liquid to gas evaporation As the states of matter change from solid to liquid to gas respectively their composition alters as well For example in a solid the bonds are stronger than hydrogen bonds which allows the solid substance to have a definite volume and shape However when heat is added to the solid and it melts to become a liquid the bonds are considerably weaker and in water are simply hydrogen bonds A liquid has a definite volume but not a definite shape and it thus takes the shape of the container in which it is When more heat is added the liquid substance evaporates and becomes a gas which has no bonds at all A gas is simply a formless collection of particles that tends to expand in all directions at the same time in order to occupy its full container If a gas is not confined the space between the particles will continue to increase A gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape In this pattern solid to liquid to gas heat is being added in order to provoke the phase change In the other direction gas to liquid to solid heat is being released through the phase change It often helps to envision an ice cube when thinking of phase changes An ice cube is a solid and when heated up it becomes liquid water When heated up some more it becomes water vapor which is a gas 

A barn is a building found on a farm It is used for holding livestock such as horses It can also be used to hold grain or tools 

A psychrometer is a device used to measure relative humidity of a certain area A psychrometer has two bulbs one wet and one dry After a period of time the water on the wet bulb evaporates and at that time the temperature is measured on each bulb The difference between the temperatures is noted Then each is used on a chart to find the relative humidity of that temperature and area A small difference between the temperature of the bulbs shows a high relative humidity coming from a low evaporation rate In dry air evaporation happens faster showing a large difference in temperature thus giving you a low relative humidity

Example 30C Dry Bulb 20C Wet Bulb 40 relative humidity

Bembridge is a village on the Isle of Wight It is the village which is farthest to the east on the island According to the 2001 census of the United Kingdom it had a population of 3848 The large population means that some people have said that it has the biggest population of any village in the United Kingdom Many of the most rich people who live on the Isle of Wight live in Bembridge

The villages of Bembridge and Yaverland were once a separate island off the coast of the rest of the Isle of Wight There was a channel of water called Brading Haven which separated the two islands Before the time in which Queen Victoria was the queen of the United Kingdom the village of Bembridge only had a few huts and farm houses It was only when a church was built in 1827 that the village started to grow 

The most old buildings in the village are found close to the church in the north of the village In this part of the village there are a number of shops pubs and restaurants There is also the village hall

It is often not easy to recognize Secret Service agents because they often dress to blend in wherever they are This means that they will often be dressed the same way as everybody else in a crowd

The United States Secret Service was created in 1865 to stop counterfeiters It did not start protecting the President until after President William McKinley was shot and killed in 1901 In 1902 President Theodore Roosevelt became the first President to be protected by Secret Service agents Since then every president has received Secret Service Protection

The Secret Service used to be part of the Treasury Department but is now part of the Department of Homeland Security

The tyranni suborder can be split into three infraorders Acanthisittides Eurylaimides and Tyrannide

The first group the Acanthisittidae are also known as the New Zealand wrens At the moment scientists are unsure whether they should belong to the tyranni or not Some scientists think they are too different and they should be in their own suborder

There are a great number of sources of ocean pollution Some of these sources are easy to find Others are harder to find

Humans dump trash in lots of places like the ocean In the 1980s scientists became alarmed by the kind of trash that was washing up on beaches Bandages bottles of blood and needles were found Some of the blood in the bottles even had the AIDS virus The Environmental Protection Agency began to investigate and found that hospitals in the United States make about 3 million tons of medical waste every year And some of this trash goes in the ocean

Because of stricter laws much of this medical waste is now buried in the ground However dumping trash in the deeper part of the ocean is still done in lots of countries

By 1990 the United States alone had already given out 38 trillion liters of broken wikt linksludgesludge into the waters along its coasts Raw sewage is all the liquid and solid wastes that go down toilets and drains After collecting in sewer drains raw sewage goes through a treatment plant where it is cleaned and the solid waste is removed Once the liquid is treated it goes to nearby waterways The remaining solid waste is called sludge This toxin and bacteria filled sludge is often dumped into the ocean The people who dump it in think it will sink to the ocean floor However this sludge does not always stay on the ocean floor Sometimes currents stir up the sludge and move it closer to shore polluting beaches and killing marine life Lots of countries have now made laws so that people cannot dump sludge However it continues to happen in many places in the world

Every time we wash a car or broken wikt linkfertilizationfertilize our lawns we are polluting the ocean People often think that water pollution comes from big factories but most of the pollution comes from everyday people doing everyday things This kind of pollution is called nonpoint source pollution because we cannot point out where it came from directly All waste water in time enters a body of water Every stream leads to a river and every river leads to an ocean

Because so many people use oil large ships must take billions of barrels of it across the oceans If it is not handled carefully these trips can be very bad In 1989 the United States experienced a large oil spill in Prince William Sound a waterway on the Alaskan coast The Exxon Valdez a very big ship hit a reef and spilled more than 260000 barrels of oil The results were very bad A great number of animals were covered in oil and began dying immediately Animals that ate these oil filled animals also died Many Alaskans who lived by fishing these animals lost their businesses Even though many animals were saved and the Exxon Oil Company spent 25 billion dollars trying to clean up the oil Alaskas wildlife still suffers

Humans have done much to harm the ocean but we are starting to try to help them Countries promise each other to clean up the ocean and save the oceans resources

When marine pollution grew worse and worse many countries saw that they needed to help each other In 1989 64 countries agreed to a broken wikt linktreatytreaty so that none of them could dump mercury cadmium compounds some kinds of plastic oil and other dangerous wastes in the ocean Many other agreements trying to lessen ocean pollution have been made but keeping them is often very hard to do

Fashion in the 15th century in Europe was characterized by a series of extremes and extravagances from the voluminous gowns called houppelandes with their sweeping floor length sleeves to the revealing doublets and hose of Renaissance Italy Hats hoods and other headdresses assumed increasing importance and were swagged draped jewelled and feathered Full bodied houppelandes with voluminous sleeves worn with elaborate headdresses are characteristic of the earlier 15th century

As Europe continued to grow more prosperous the urban middle classes skilled workers began to wear more complex clothes that followed at a distance the fashions set by the elites National variations in clothing seem on the whole to have increased over the century 

Wool was the most popular fabric for all classes by far followed by linen and hemp Wool fabrics were available in a wide range of qualities from rough undyed cloth to fine dense broadcloth with a velvety nap high value broadcloth was a backbone of the English economy and was exported throughout Europe Wool fabrics were dyed in rich colours notably reds greens golds and blues although the actual blue colour achievable with dyeing with woad could not match the characteristic rich lapis lazuli pigment blues depicted in contemporary illuminated manuscripts such as the Trs Riches Heures du duc de Berry

Silk weaving was well established around the Mediterranean by the beginning of the century and figured silks often silk velvets with silver gilt wefts are increasingly seen in Italian dress and in the dress of the wealthy throughout Europe Stately floral designs featuring a pomegranate or artichoke motif had reached Europe from China in the previous century and became a dominant design in the Ottoman silk producing cities of Istanbul and Bursa and spread to silk weavers in Florence Genoa Venice Valencia and Seville in this period 

Fur was worn mostly as a lining layer by those who could afford it The grey and white squirrel furs of the Middle Ages vair and miniver went out of style except at court first for men and then for women the new fashionable furs were dark brown sable and marten Toward the end of the century wild animal furs such as lynx became popular Ermine remained the prerogative and hallmark of royalty

In mathematics a Markov chain named after Andrey Markov is a discrete random process with the Markov property A discrete random process means a system which can be in various states The system also changes randomly in discrete steps It can be helpful to think of the system as evolving through discrete steps in time although strictly speaking the step may have nothing to do with time

An example of a Markov chain is the dietary habits of a creature who only eats grapes cheese or lettuce and whose dietary habits conform to the following rules It eats exactly once a day If it ate cheese yesterday it will eat lettuce or grapes today with equal probability for each and zero chance of eating cheese If it ate grapes yesterday it will eat grapes today with probability 110 cheese with probability 410 and lettuce with probability 510 Finally if it ate lettuce yesterday it wont eat it again today but will eat grapes with probability 410 or cheese with probability 610 This creatures eating habits can be modeled with a Markov chain since its choice depends on what it ate yesterday not additionally on what it ate 2 or 3 days ago One statistical property one could calculate is the expected percentage of the time the creature will eat cheese over a long period

Mary Anning was an early 19th century British fossil collector dealer and paleontologist She earnt her living finding and preparing fossils in the rich Jurassic marine strata at Lyme Regis Dorset where she lived She made many important finds These included the first ichthyosaur skeleton to be correctly identified the first two plesiosaur skeletons ever found the first pterosaur skeleton found outside Germany and some important fish fossils 

Her observations played a key role in the discoveries that belemnite fossils contained fossilized ink sacs and that coprolites known as bezoar stones at the time were fossilized faeces When the geologist Henry De la Beche painted Duria Antiquior he based it largely on fossils Anning had found He sold prints for her benefit Her work played a key role in the growth of scientific biology in the early 19th century It showed without question that previously unknown forms of life had existed in the Jurassic seas all of which were long extinct

Annings sex and social classher parents were poor religious dissentersprevented her from fully participating in the scientific community of early 19th century England dominated as it was by wealthy Anglican gentlemen Some of the men she worked with and for did give her full credit for her contributions but some did not 

Although she became well known in geological circles in Britain Europe and America and she made a great deal of money from her best finds she struggled financially for much of her life In 1818 Anning came to the attention of Thomas Birch a wealthy fossil collector when she sold him an ichthyosaur skeleton A year later he was disturbed by the poverty of the Anning family which was at the point of having to sell their furniture to make ends meet Birch arranged for the sale by auction of his own fossil collection and the proceeds were given to the Annings Besides providing much needed funds the public auction raised the profile of the Anning family in the geologic community Later she lost 300 in 1835 on unwise investments but was saved by a government pension of 25 per year This was organised by another of her friends William Buckland Her early death was caused by breast cancer

Tourists used to visit Lyme Regis which had become a popular seaside resort As their father had before them Mary and her brother Joseph Anning set up a table of curiosities near the coach stop at a local inn to sell their wares to tourists After Joseph made an important find of an ichthyosaur skull in 1810 and Mary found the associated skeleton a year later they became known to the geologists and amateurs interested in fossils Their passion for fossils grew to be the main source of income for the family

Her stock in trade were invertebrate fossils such as ammonite and belemnite shells which were common in the area and sold for a few shillings Vertebrate fossils were much rarer and exceptional specimens like an almost complete ichthyosaur skeleton could sell for much more

The source of these fossils were the coastal cliffs that surround Lyme which are part of a geological formation known as the Blue Lias This formation consists of alternating layers of limestone and shale laid down as sediment on a shallow seabed early in the Jurassic period The cliffs are one of the richest fossil locations in Britain

As Mary Anning continued to make important finds her reputation grew In 1826 at the age of 27 she managed to save enough money to buy a home with a glass store front window for her shop called Annings Fossil Depot The move was covered in the local paper which noted that the shop currently had a fine ichthyosaur skeleton on display Many geologists and fossil collectors from Europe and America visited Anning at Lyme to purchase specimens These included the geologist George William Featherstonhaugh who purchased fossils for the newly opened New York Lyceum of Natural History in 1827 King Frederick Augustus II of Saxony visited her shop in 1844 and purchased an ichthyosaur skeleton for his extensive natural history collection

Lady Harriet Silvester visited Lyme in 1824 She remarked in her diary the extraordinary thing in this young woman is that she has made herself so thoroughly acquainted with the science that the moment she finds any bones she knows to what tribe they belong She fixes the bones on a frame with cement and then makes drawings and has them engraved  It is certainly a wonderful instance of divine favour that this poor ignorant girl should be so blessed for by reading and application she has arrived to that degree of knowledge as to be in the habit of writing and talking with professors and other clever men on the subject and they all acknowledge that she understands more of the science than anyone else in this kingdom  As time passed her confidence in her knowledge increased and in 1839 she wrote to the Magazine of Natural History to question their claim that a hooked tooth of the prehistoric shark Hybodus represented a new discovery She had discovered years ago the existence of fossil sharks with both straight and hooked teeth The extract from the letter that the magazine printed was the only thing that Anning ever published

Mary Anning is the subject of the old tongue twister She sells sea shells on the sea shore It was composed in 1908 more than a half century after her death by Terry Sullivan who was inspired by her life story The original text was She sells seashells on the seashore The shells she sells are seashells Im sure So if she sells seashells on the seashore Then Im sure she sells seashore shells 

Annings life story was seen as inspirational by a number of writers in the 20th century Most of this material was intended as inspirational literature for children and tended to focus on her childhood and early career neglecting her later accomplishments Much of it was also romanticized and not always historically accurate She appeared as a character in historical novels perhaps most notably in The French Lieutenants Woman by John Fowles which was made into a feature film in 1981 Fowles observed critically that no British scientist had named a species after Anning in her lifetime 

However in the 1840s the Swiss American expert on fossil fish Louis Agassiz did name two fossil fish species Acrodus anningiae and Belenostomus anningiae after her and another after her friend Elizabeth Philpot Agassiz was grateful for the help the two women had given him in examining and understanding fossil fish specimens during his 1834 visit to Lyme Regis

Bach Werke Verzeichnis is a list of all the pieces of music by Johann Sebastian Bach that are known In English it means Bach Works Catalogue

The catalogue was made by Wolfgang Schmieder in 1950 He took all the music that is known by Johann Sebastian Bach and gave each piece a number Each piece of music by Bach therefore has a BWV number  For example the Mass in B minor is BWV 232 Giving each piece a number helps us to know exactly which piece of music we are talking about For example there are several Preludes and Fugues in G major but putting Prelude and Fugue in G major BWV550 makes it clear which one it is

The BWV numbers are not listed chronologically They are grouped according to what kind of music it is all the cantatas together all the concertos together etc

Some pieces of music may be written by Bach but we are not sure Those doubtful pieces of music are listed separately as BWV Anhang Some of what Schmieder wrote in 1950 has been updated because some new music by Bach has been discovered Other pieces of music have now been proved not to be by Bach

Bach like many composers from long ago did not use opus numbers because very few of his works were published during his lifetime

Some older books write S instead of BWV but Schmieder did not want this He wanted Bachs name to be used not his own

The Holodomor was a man made famine and possibly a genocide that happened in Ukraine in 1932 and in 1933 At that time Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union About seven million people starved to death in the Holodomor

Joseph Stalin was the leader of the Soviet Union which was a communist country He made farmers in the Soviet Union change the way they farmed then he tried to make the farmers work harder for the government owned farms for less money Many people in the Ukraine did not want to go along with this When the Ukraine had a famine Stalin refused to help the people in the Ukraine Instead the government took food away from people It became against the law to pick up food from the ground of fields The government also tried to stop people from moving around the country to look for food

Scholars and politicians using the word Holodomor say the man made aspects of the famine was a genocide some consider the huge loss of life comparable to the Holocaust They argue that the Soviet policies were an attack on the rise of Ukrainian nationalism and therefore is a genocide 

Castling is a special move in chess that uses both a rook and the king In castling the king is moved two squares toward the rook and the rook moves past the king to the square right next to where the king has moved Castling takes one move and is the only way for a player to move two of his own pieces on the same move Castling can be done on either side of the board

Castling is only possible if each of the following things are true

Good players castle in most of their games It is normally a good idea because it often moves the king into a safer place The middle of the board is normally not a very safe place for the king to be early in the game It also makes it easier to get the rook into the game 

In psychology the effect of the false consensus is the tendency for people to assume that everyone else thinks the same way they do

It is a cognitive bias in which many person tend to overestimate the agreement grade that the other people have with them Most of the time people think that their own attitudes beliefs predilections values and habits are among those chosen most of the time This belief is a bias that exaggerate the trust on individuals with their own beliefs even if they are wrong

Another effect which can often be seen together with false consensus is called pluralistic ignorance In pluralistic ignorance people support a norm or a belief in public even though they think this is wrong For instance pluralistic ignorance may lead a student to drink a lot of alcohol because he believes that everyone else does that as well In reality however everyone else also wishes they could avoid binge drinking Everyone fears that they will be excluded from the group so no one expresses this fear A false consensus for the same situation would mean that a student believes that most other people enjoy excessive drinking while most other people do not and openly express their opinion about it

Eudimorphodon is a recently discovered pterosaur and comes from shale laid down Upper Triassic rocks in Italy 

A nearly complete skeleton was found in 1973 which show it to be a member of the long tailed sub order of pterosaurs the Rhamphorhynchoidea Eudimorphodon was small in size with 110 teeth packed into a jaw only 6 cms long Teeth at the front are fangs further back the teeth are small and multipointed many with five cusps This is unique among pterosaurs whose teeth are usually of a simple conical form

Stomach contents showed it had eaten a small fish Parapholidophorus The top and bottom teeth of Eudimorphodon came into direct contact with each other when the jaws were closed especially at the back of the jaw The teeth were multi cusped and tooth wear shows that Eudimorphodon was able to crush or chew its food to some degree Wear along the sides of these teeth suggests that Eudimorphodon also fed on hard shelled invertebrates

Juvenile Eudimorphodon had somewhat different and fewer teeth and may have eaten insects 

An unsolved puzzle is the flexibility of the tail which lacks the very long stiffening vertebral extensions other long tailed pterosaurs have This flexibility is a basal trait its functional significance in this genus is unknown However it is known that the stiffened tail of Rhamphorhynchus like pterosaurs is a device which adds stability to their flight Without this stability the animal would be more manoeuvrable but their flight would need more control by the brain

Henry Fielding wrote the play The Authors Farce and the Pleasures of the Town It was first acted on 30 March 1730 in the Haymarket Theatre The play responds to the rejection of Fieldings early plays and was his first success

Harry Luckless is the main character of the play He tries to write a play in the first act and completes the play in the second act It is a puppet play called The Pleasures of the Town Many theatres do not accept the play but it is later shown within the third act The play is about the puppet character Goddess Nonsense who wants a husband The end of The Authors Farce combines the characters of the puppet play and the main play for humour

Fielding became a popular writer in London after The Authors Farce The Haymarket Theatre let him experiment with his plays and Fielding changed the comedy genre The puppet play within the main play made fun of other London plays The Authors Farce was first a success Then it was ignored by critics until the 20th century Critics focused on the plays effects on Fieldings work

The Authors Farce has three acts The play begins with Harry Luckless wanting a relationship with his landladys daughter Harriot Also he is a writer and he is writing a play The start of the play is like Fieldings other plays but the rest of the play is different Luckless wants to be a good writer but he cannot make money Other people want to give Luckless money but he does not want it When Lucklesss friend Witmore pays Lucklesss rent Luckless steals the money back In the second act Luckless asks for help to finish his puppet play The Pleasures of the Town However people give him bad advice and theatres reject the play Later a theatre shows the play The third act is the puppet play The puppets are acted by real people and not puppets

The third act is the puppet play and is a play within a play It takes place along the River Styx and starts with the Goddess of Nonsense wanting a husband There are many possible husbands there and they are stupid They are Dr Orator Sir Farcical Comic Mrs Novel Bookseller Poet Monsieur Pantomime Don Tragedio and Signior Opera She selects Signior Opera after he sings for her He is an opera signior and a castrato Mrs Novel claims that she and Signior Opera had a child This makes the Goddess of Nonsense angry but she forgives Signior Opera The puppet play is stopped by the characters Constable and Murdertext They want to arrest Luckless for hurting the Goddess of Nonsense Mrs Novel asks for the play to be completed and they agree However a person from the land of Bantam stops the play and says that Luckless is the prince of Bantam Another messenger comes and says that the King of Bantam died and Luckless is the new king Luckless is told that his landlady is the Queen of Old Brentford and her daughter Harriot is a princess The play ends with four poets saying how they would end the play They are stopped by a cat that looks like a person The cat person ends the play

The Authors Farce show parts of Fieldings life and experience with the London theatre community Some of his other plays were rejected from the Theatre Royal The Authors Farce was put on at a small theatre This allowed Fielding to experiment He could not experiment at larger theatres The play was the first to have things found in his later plays However he did not come up with them all He got many of his ideas from the Scriblerus Club Their members were Alexander Pope Jonathan Swift John Gay and John Arbuthnot One idea is his character Nonsense She is similar to Popes character Dulness in the Dunciad Both characters promote bad writing Fielding gave Nonsense a sexual aspect It is funny when she chooses as a lover a man who is sexless Other parts of the play are similar to Gays Beggars Opera

The play is a farce Farces use slapstick and physical humour to be funny They also use absurd plots A farce also makes serious situations funny Fielding thought that theatre was becoming bad He mocked theatre and theatre audiences in his play His character Luckless states that for someone to become successful they must write nonsense His only desire is to make money Other characters feel that money is all that matters They do not care about good writing Even Harriot believes that a good lover is one who is rich Fielding made the same claims about people when he attacked Samuel Richardsons novel Pamela

The ending of the play merges real and fake Fielding defends an old view of writing He also attacks new types of writing He uses puppets to represent various genres He made fun of people liking Italian opera The puppet character Signior Opera is a castrato Castratos are men without testicles The character Nonsense wants him as a lover Mrs Novel says that Signior Opera had a baby with her However Signior Opera cant have sex or have babies Fielding is mocking how women like Italian opera singers Other writers mocked Italian opera singers William Hogarth says the castratos are related to politics Many other writers make fun of women who favour castratos

The play uses characters and ideas from Fieldings life The characters Marplay and Sparkish manage the theatre They offer Luckless poor advice on how to write a play Then also reject Lucklesss play This is what Colley Cibber and Robert Wilks did to Fielding They rejected his play The Temple Beau When Wilks died Fielding changed the play He removed Sparkish He added a character like Theophilus Cibber the son of Colley The character was like Theopilus during the Actor Rebellion of 1733 

Luckless and Mrs Moneywood is similar to Fielding with Jan Oson Oson was his landlord during 1729 When staying with Oson Fielding owed a lot of money Fielding fled to London and Oson took his property to pay for the debt Mrs Moneywood does the same in the play Characters in the puppet play are based on real people Mrs Novel is Eliza Haywood Signior Opera is Senesino Bookweight is similar to Edmund Curll Orator is John Henley Monsieur Pantomime is John Rich Don Tragedio is Lewis Theobald Sir Farcical Comick is of Colley Cibber as an actor

Fielding also used literary sources His plot is like George Farquhars Love and a Bottle Both talk about a writing and a landlady They have many differences Fielding took from the writing of the Scriblerus Club and other plays Lucklesss life is similar to characters in John Drydens The Rehearsal Farquhars Love and a Bottle James Ralphs The Touch Stone and Richard Savages An Author to be Lett The play has similar ideas to Dunciad Variorum He also borrowed from Gays Three Hours after Marriage and The Beggars Opera Fieldings play also influenced other works They included the revised Dunciad and Gays The Rehearsal at Goatham

The play was successful Fielding became a popular writer It was shown with Tom Thumb That helped it be liked The Pleasures of the Town was the most liked part The Daily Post newspaper said it was approved by all A newspaper that didnt like Fielding also said that the play was liked Many well known people and royalty in Britain saw the show John Perceval 1st Earl of Egmont said that the play was full of humour with some wit The play was rarely mentioned later in the 18th century This was true in the 19th century The play was printed again a few times Leslie Stephen and Austin Dobson studied the play They looked at what the play said about Fieldings life 

20th century critics agreed with Dobson Many of the critics like Charles Woods talked about the play as part of Fieldings writing career He also said the work was not political Later critics agreed with Woods Many modern critics approved of the play They are Wilbur Cross Frederick Homes Dudden Ian Donaldson Pat Rogers Robert Hume Martin and Ruthe Battestin Harold Pagliaro and Thomas Lockwood Some critics liked the play but not all of it They are J Paul Hunter Matthew Kinservik

In those days girls spent some time each day especially to write letters so a story through letters is much more realistic than it would be today People like Frances Burney wrote letters that were witty and full of information so that her diaries and letters were later published The letters of William Cowper too are famous Jane Austens letters however are private letters about family matters such as sick babies partners at balls beef and raspberry bushes

Crime and Punishment is a novel by Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky It was first published in the literary journal The Russian Messenger in 12 monthly series in 1866 It was later published in a single volume It is the second of Dostoevskys completed novels after he returned from his exile in Siberia and the first great novel of his mature period

Crime and Punishment is about the troubles of Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov Raskolnikov is a young man living in St Petersburg He used to be a student but he became so poor he had to stop studying He plans to kill a selfish old pawnbroker for her money and he acts on his plan Raskolnikov argues that with her money he can do good things and that he was simply killing a person who was not worth anything He also murdered her to test his idea that some people are naturally better than others and have the right to murder Several times in the novel Raskolnikov justifies himself by comparing himself to Napoleon saying that murder is allowed for a higher purpose

However after he kills the pawnbroker questions which he cannot answer and feelings he had not expected terrify him He feels separated from mankind nature and truth Because of this he decides at last to confess to the police and accept suffering

Dostoevsky began the idea of Crime and Punishment in the summer of 1865 This was after he had gambled away much of his money Because of this he could not pay his bills or eat properly He owed large sums of money to creditors and was also trying to help the family of his brother Mikhail Mikhail had died in early 1864 He began writing it under the title The Drunkards He wanted to write about the current problem of drunkenness However when Dostoevsky began writing about Raskolnikovs crime the theme of crime and punishment became his main subject instead

Dostoevsky offered his story to the publisher Mikhail Katkov Famous writers such as Ivan Turgenev and Leo Tolstoy often used Katkovs monthly journal The Russian Messenger to print their writings Dostoevsky though had argued with Katkov in the early 1860s and had never printed anything in the journal Finally Dostoevsky asked Katkov for help when others would not print his book In September 1865 Dostoevsky wrote a letter to Katkov In the letter he explained to him that Crime and Punishment was going to be about a young man who believes in certain strange unfinished ideas yes floating in the air He also said that he wanted to study the moral and psychological dangers of radical ideas In letters written in November 1865 an important change had happened the story has become a novel From then on Dostoevsky always spoke of Crime and Punishment as a novel

Dostoevsky had to write very quickly to finish both The Gambler and Crime and Punishment Anna Snitkina a stenographer whom he later married helped him very much The first part of Crime and Punishment appeared in January 1866 in The Russian Messenger The last part was published in December 1866

When Dostoevskys complete writings were published in the Soviet Union the editors put together the notebooks that Dostoevsky kept while he was working on Crime and Punishment and printed it They printed the notebooks in the same order as the book was written Through their efforts there is now a small part of how Dostoevsky first imagined Crime and Punishment to be written There are also two other versions of the story They are called the Wiesbaden edition the Petersburg edition and the final plan A part of a change in the story was that instead of the story being told by a character inside it it was written as if many uninvolved people were writing it The Wiesbaden edition is mostly about the reaction of the writer to his murder It is quite similar to the story that Dostoevsky described in his letter to Katkov and was written like a diary or journal It had the same story as what later became part II

Raskolnikov is a mentally insecure student who has stopped going to university He lives in a very small rented room in Saint Petersburg He does not let anyone help him not even his friend Razumihin He plans to kill and steal money from an old pawnbroker and moneylender Alyona Ivanovna but it is not clear why he wants to kill her yet While he is thinking about this plan Raskolnikov meets Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov a sad drunkard who recently spent all of his poor familys money on drinking He also gets a letter from his mother His mother says that she will soon visit St Petersburg She writes about his sisters sudden engagement saying that they will talk about it when they arrive

After thinking Raskolnikov goes to Alyona Ivanovnas apartment There he murders her with an axe Her quiet half sister Lizaveta comes inside Surprised Raskolnikov quickly kills her too Frightened by what he has done he leaves most of Alyona Ivanovnas wealth behind only stealing a few things and a small purse He then runs away without being seen by anybody

After his murder Raskolnikov is filled with worry He hides the things he stole under a rock and tries to clean away the blood from his clothes After a short visit to his friend Razumihin he becomes sick with a fever and seems to wish to betray himself Whenever anyone speaks of the murder of the pawnbroker he acts strangely

David Copperfield is the title of a famous novel by Charles Dickens It first came out as a series in a magazine like his other novels 

When first published in the magazine it had the title of The Personal History Adventures Experience and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery 

The story is told in the first person as if David were writing it Some of the greatest Dickens characters appear in the novel such as Mr Micawber sympathetic but always in money trouble and his evil clerk Uriah Heep Other villains in Davids life are his brutal stepfather Edward Murdstone and Mr Creakle the headmaster of the boarding school that Murdstone sends him to

The evil characters are balanced by others such as Peggotty the faithful servant of the Copperfield family and a lifelong companion to David Agnes Wickfield is a close friend of David since childhood and later becomes Davids second wife and mother of their children Micawber is a gentle and friendly man who goes to debtors prison but in the end makes a success as a sheep farmer in Australia He is based on Dickens own father

The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is a book written by C S Lewis It is set in an imaginary place called Narnia where the main characters who are brothers and sisters are led into by the back of a wardrobe It is the second book by order in the Narnia series after The Magicians Nephew but is the first book published in the series

Peter Susan Edmund and Lucy Pevensie leave London during World War II to live in the country While playing in the house Lucy hides in a wardrobe She finds that it leads to a different land There she meets a faun named Mr Tumnus While having tea he tells her that the land is called Narnia It is ruled by the White Witch who makes it always winter but never Christmas When Lucy returns to the wardrobe after many hours she finds that only a few seconds have passed in England Her brothers and sister do not believe her and the wardrobe has closed so they cannot go into Narnia 

Many weeks later Lucy comes back to the wardrobe during a game of hide and seek Edmund follows her into Narnia but cannot find her Instead he meets a lady She says she is the Queen of Narnia and gives him Turkish Delight She promises to make him prince if he will bring the other children to her castle After she leaves Edmund finds Lucy When she talks about the White Witch he thinks that it is the lady he met When they get back to England Edmund lies to Peter and Susan and says they did not go to Narnia This makes Lucy upset 

Later they are all hiding from the housekeeper and go into the wardrobe This time they all go into Narnia When Lucy leads them to Tumnuss cave they find that he is arrested and his cave destroyed Two talking beavers shelter the children They also tell them about a prophecy that the witch will fail when two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve sit on the thrones at Cair Paravel Narnias ruling castle The beavers also tell them about Aslan the true king of Narnia He is a great lion and has been gone for many years but has come back 

Edmund sneaks away to go to the witch When they find out the children and beavers go to find Aslan The witch is mean to Edmund because he did not bring his siblings and leaves to chase them The winter is starting to warm into spring and she is stopped by the thaw The children find Aslan and rescue Edmund just before the witch kills him He is very sorry for following her The witch says that Edmund must be given back to her because of an old law The law says that all traitors belong to her Aslan gives himself in place He is killed but comes back to life through an even older law This one says that if someone who has not committed the crime willingly takes the punishment he will come back to life 

In a big fight the witch is killed by Aslan The children are kings and queens in Narnia for 15 years growing into adults Then they return to England through the wardrobe and are kids again Little time has passed

Peter Pevensie is the oldest Pevensie He does not believe about Narnia until he sees it He kills a wolf Maugrim the head of the witchs police He is call Sir Peter Wolfs Bane because of this In the end he is High King of Narnia He is called King Peter the Magnificent

Susan Pevensie is second oldest Like Peter she does not believe in Narnia until they go there She receives a gift from Father Christmas a magical horn At the end of the book she is called Queen Susan the Gentle 

Edmund Pevensie is the third child He likes the White Witch because she gives him sweets and promises to make him prince He is sorry for that When he is King he is known as King Edmund the Just 

Lucy Pevensie is the youngest Pevensie child She is the first to find Narnia She is very good friends with MrTumnus At the end of the book she is known of Queen Lucy the Valiant 

The White Witch is the false queen of Narnia She makes it always winter but never Christmas She can turn things to stone She is afraid of the children and Aslan because they should be the rulers 

Aslan is the true king of Narnia and a lion He gives himself to save Edmund but comes back to life through an old law called the Deeper Magic In the battle he kills the witch He leaves after the children are crowned

Epicureanism is a philosophy based on the teachings of Epicurus Epicureanism was started around 307 BC Epicurus was a materialist who believed there were atoms The teaching about atoms was first started by Democritus Epicurus was a materialist he fiercely attacked superstition According to Epicurus the gods are passive They do not intervene in the world According to Aristippus Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to have certain pleasures and to reach a state of mind where there is no fear and no pain Epicureanism is a form of hedonism because it declares that pleasure is the only good there really is Epicureanism says that theabsence of pain is the greatest pleasure it also advocates a simple life These ideas make it sufficiently different from hedonism as it is usually defined

In the Epicurean view the highest pleasure was obtained by knowledge friendship and living a virtuous and temperate life Epicurus spoke favorably about the enjoyment of simple pleasures He also meant abstaining from bodily desires such as sex and appetites almost like asceticism He argued that when eating one should not eat too richly for it could lead to dissatisfaction later such as the grim realization that one could not afford such delicacies in the future Likewise sex could lead to increased lust and dissatisfaction with the sexual partner Epicurus did not articulate a broad system of social morality that has survived

Epicureanism was originally a challenge to Platonism though later it became the main opponent of Stoicism Epicurus and his followers shunned politics After the death of Epicurus his school was headed by Hermarchus later many Epicurean societies flourished in the Late Hellenistic era and during the Roman era The poet Lucretius is its most known Roman proponent By the end of the Roman Empire having undergone Christian attack and repression Epicureanism had all but died out and would be resurrected in the 17th century by the atomist Pierre Gassendi who adapted it to the Christian doctrine

Some writings by Epicurus have survived Some scholars consider the epic poem On the Nature of Things by Lucretius to present in one unified work the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism Many of the papyrus scrolls unearthed at the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum are Epicurean texts At least some are thought to have belonged to the Epicurean Philodemus

A chocolate chip cookie is a cookie from the United States They have chocolate chips inside them which are the most important ingredient The original recipe has a dough made of butter and both brown and white sugar Other kinds have additional ingredients such as nuts and oatmeal They can also have different types of chocolate in them

Chocolate chip cookies can be bought premade Several brands sell them They are one of the more common types of cookies

The chocolate chip cookie was accidentally made by Ruth Graves Wakefield in 1933 She owned the Toll House Inn in Whitman Massachusetts The Toll House Inn was a very famous restaurant that made and served food in a home cooking style The restaurant was popular in the 1930s not just because of its style but also because Ruth gave diners extra food and some homemade cookies to take home with them Her cookbook Toll House Tried and True Recipes was published in 1936 by M Barrows Company New York It included the recipe Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookie which rapidly became a favorite to be baked in American homes Toll House still sells chocolate chips for the cookies today

Chocolate chip cookies may have started when Wakefield made a mistake According to one story Wakefield was making chocolate cookies and because there was no more regular chocolate she used broken pieces of semi sweet chocolate instead thinking it would melt and mix into the batter Instead it did not and that was how chocolate chip cookies were made

The Congo Rainforest in Central Africa is a rainforest containing one of the longest rivers in the world The tropical rainforest covers most of the northern part of the Congo This forest and its river were the subject of a famous book called The Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad Hunting has endangered many of the animals there but the jungle itself is not being destroyed as it is in Brazil

Like all rainforests the Congo Basin is home to many unusual animals and plants The pygmy chimpanzee for example lives only in the Congo rainforests Also the hippopotamus is another animal that can be found in the Congo rainforest usually in the river The people of Congo love to eat hippopotamus meat Many of the hippos are killed for the food even though it is illegal African elephants also live in the rainforest They have long teeth called tusks that stick out from their sides of their mouths made of ivory Also gorillas live in the rainforest of central Africa The gorillas of the Congo rain forest are called lowland gorillas

There were several important kingdoms in the Congo region before the Europeans came there The Kongo Empire was one of these The Kongo was a group of small states near the mouth of the Congo river ruled by a king That nation gave the river its name

The Portuguese came to the Kongo for the first time in the 1480s Portugal was sailing farther and farther along the coast of Africa to reach India and China on the other side At first they made friends with the Kongo nation They sent missionaries and ambassadors Unfortunately the friendship did not last The Portuguese were more interested in making money than making friends It is especially sad that the Portuguese were more interested in making money than making friends It is especially sad that the Portuguese treated the people of the Kongo so badly The king of Kongo became a Christian and took the name Afonso He wanted to learn from the Europeans and teach his people but the Portuguese only wanted to use their friendship with Afonso to gain slaves to sell Many people were sold as slaves and within 100 years the kingdom of Kongo was destroyed

The Portuguese could not sail up the river because of the waterfalls near the mouth Also the broken wikt linkhumidityhumid tropical region was uncomfortable for Europeans So the Congo area was not explored or claimed again by any European country for many years

In the 1870s a reporter named Henry Stanley went to find one of the most famous missionaryexplorers in history Dr David Livingstone thinking he was dead Stanley became the first man known to have followed the Congo river across Africa to its mouth He proved that there were many miles of navigable river above the waterfalls His discoveries interested King Leopold of Belgium The king hired him to build a road around the waterfalls and trading posts aloing the river itself In this way the king gained control of the river basin In 1885 Leopold used his control of the river to claim all of the Congo as his own private land

The region was named the Congo Free State but it was not free King Leopold only cared about making money from the land The people were treated cruelly They were forced into slavery to build roads and gather rubber latex When they did not do what their Belgian masters wanted they were often killed Missionaries in the Congo began to write letters and articles about the things that were happening

Eventually the anger over what was happening forced the government of Belgium to take the land away from the king It was renamed the Belgian Congo but Belgium did not do very much to help the people Catholic missionaries did set up schools with the help from the government But Europeans ran all the schools businesses army large farms and government

Before World War II almost all the countries of Africa were European colonies After the war these nations began to demand and receive their independence Belgium did not want to give the Congo its independence but after a fight in 1958 they made an agreement The Congo became a free nation in June 1960

A credit default swap is a kind of investment where you pay someone so they will pay you if a certain company gives up on paying its bonds or defaults A credit default swap is like insurance on bonds but different from insurance in important ways

Because nobody makes sure you have the bonds you get credit default swaps for people can speculate on them by buying credit default swaps on companies they think will get in trouble

When Lehman Brothers went bankrupt on September 15 2008 it defaulted on its bonds The insurance company AIG had sold lots of credit default swaps for Lehman but they didnt have enough money to pay all the people they had sold them to 

This is because the way lots of companies speculated by hedging on credit default swaps They bought credit default swaps for a company and then sold credit default swaps for the same company when the CDSes got more expensive For example if you bought a some Lehman Brothers CDSes from AIG where you had to pay 500000 and you sold the same number of CDSes on Lehman a year later for 600000 you made 100000 If Lehman defaulted youre supposed to pay the people you sold the CDSes to but that should be OK because now AIG is supposed to pay you for the CDSes you bought

The problem was that so many companies did that that when Lehman collapsed nobody had enough money for the people they sold CDSes to They tried getting it from the companies theyd bought CDSes from but they didnt have enough money either Those companies tried collecting from the companies that owed them money but they didnt have enough either and so on Since AIG had sold so many of these people were afraid that AIG would just give up on trying to pay them all If they had done that there would be a domino effect where everybody would go out of business Because so many companies wouldve gone out of business the government decided to help AIG pay so the economy wouldnt collapse

When people found out that the Greek government owed more money than everybody thought it did people who didnt own any Greek government bonds started buying credit default swaps on Greek bonds They did that because they thought Greece would give up on trying to pay so the bonds would become worthless and the people who sold the credit default swaps would pay them Unfortunately this makes people who have Greek bonds nervous so they want to sell them and not buy any more That makes it hard for Greece to borrow money to fix its money problems

In paleontology a Lazarus taxon is a taxon that disappears from one or more periods of the fossil record only to appear again later The term refers to the Gospel of John in which Jesus is claimed to have raised Lazarus from the dead Lazarus taxa occur either because of extinction later resupplied or as a sampling artifact The fossil record is imperfect and contains gaps not necessarily caused by extinction particularly when the number of individuals in a taxon becomes very low 

The concept was developed in palaeontology where after a major extinction event some groups reappear after millions of years The usual explanation is that numbers were driven so low that their chance of fossilisation were extremely low Then gradually their numbers revived 

In 1974 Batten pointed out that the Lower Triassic record lacked genera and species which had been present in the Permian but which reappeared 20 million years later in the Middle Triassic Jablonski later coined the term Lazarus taxon for species and genera which disappear from the fossil record only to reappear later when conditions return to normal

There are some well known examples of it happening to present day species

The 2010 Cauquenes earthquake was an earthquake that happened off the coast of Maule region of Chile near Cauquenes on February 27 2010 at 334 local time It is said to have lasted between ten and thirty seconds At first its magnitude was reported to be between 83 and 85 on the Moment magnitude scale but this was later corrected upwards to be at 88 of that scale It was the strongest earthquake in Chile since the magnitude 95 1960 Valdivia earthquake and the strongest earthquake worldwide since the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake 

The epicenter of the earthquake was offshore from the Maule Region approximately 8 km west of Curanipe and 115 km north northeast of Chiles second largest city Concepcin Also the epicenter is less than 20 km due east from that of the 1960 Valdivia earthquake Other cities exposed to Mercalli intensity scale intensity VIII shaking were Arauco Lota and Constitucin

The earthquake was also felt in the Chilean capital Santiago as well as in some Argentinean cities Tsunami warnings were issued in 53 countries Michelle Bachelet President of Chile declared a state of catastrophe She also confirmed the deaths of at least 795 people

Chile was hit by another earthquake in March 11 2010 with epicenter in the coastern town of Pichilemu Province of Cardenal Caro almost 200 kilometers from Santiago de Chile It was MW 69 in the Richter scale

The term wigger means a person who by act does things that stereotypically are related to urban African Americans Black British and Caribbean culture especially in relation to hip hop culture and British GrimeGarage scene The word can also be spelled as wigga whigger or whigga also known as acting black 

The term originates from a blend of the word white and the insulting term nigger The word is considered offensive by some because of its sameness to nigger Also known to be offensive due to stereotypical ideas about urban blacks

The act of white people using stereotypical black actions slang and clothing has appeared in many generations since slavery was removed in the western world The concept has been documented in the United States Canada United Kingdom Australia and other white majority countries An early form of this was the white negro in the jazz and swing music scenes of the 1920s and 1930s as seen in the 1957 Norman Mailer essay The White Negro Superficial Reflections on the Hipster It was later seen in the Zoot suiter of the 1930s and 1940s the hipster of the 1940s and the beatnik and rock and roller of the 1950s

An opcode identifies which basic computer operation in the instruction set is to be performed It is used when writing machine code It tells the computer to do something Each machine language instruction typically has both an opcode and operands The opcode is like a verb in a sentence and the operands are like the subject in a sentence Operands are typically memory or registry addresses

Opcodes are used in machine code for a number of functions including Float Addition of registers Twos compliment addition of registers Shifting register values to memory or to a hard drive sopping a program etc There are quite literally hundreds of common opcodes employed in modern computers

Due to the nature of a computers architecture opcodes take the form of binary numbers Alternatively opcodes can be represented by hexadecimal digits for ease of reading and coding when designing or emulating a machine code program These values are then transformed into their binary equivalents to be saved Modern opcodes are at least two hex characters in length which take up 1 byte of storage space

Opcodes will vary in capability and value depending on the computer to which they belong as they are hardware dependent For instance the opcode for STORE as expressed in Hex could be FA for one machine and 02 for another Some opcodes will not be available on some computers In general there are two approaches toward building instruction sets A reduced instruction set computer offers less possible opcodes in favor of increasing speed for simple processes Complex instruction set Computing offers more opcodes in favor of increasing speed for complex processes

Opcodes are seldom used by programmers directly Whenever they are directly programmed into memory they are only ever guaranteed to work on the computer they were designed for When programmers write in assembly language a translator program converts program statements one for one into machine language commands The programmer must only remember a mnemonic for each opcode instead of its binary value Alternatively a high level programming language can be used say 4th generation which gets converted to 3rd generation and so on until it reaches 1st generation From here an individual computer will convert the program to machine code whenever the program file is read This way a program can work on a much larger variety of computers

A Viral culture is a laboratory test in which the virus samples are placed with a cell medium that the virus being tested for is able to infect If the cells show changes known as cytopathic effects then a culture is positive meaning the test indicates infection

The older way of viral culture has been replaced by shell vial culture in which the sample is spun onto a single layer of cells and viral growth is measured by antigen detection ways This shortens the time to detection for slow growing viruses such as cytomegalovirus for which the method was developed

Viruses are near the same to living organisms however there are differences One of the ways a virus can be seen as living is that a virus needs to make more of themselves A virus cannot survive on its own It is only active when reproducing within a host using a hosts resources and food Once inside a host a viruss main purpose is to make as many copies of itself and infect other host cells everything it does is to benefit its fitness and increase the number of its offspring 

The viral life cycle is dependent on a host cell A virus is not able to replicate on its own or use raw materials on which to survive A virus will remain dormant until it is able to infect the next host activate and replicate Some viruses can live in an open place for a short time in some cases only a few hours Viruses use the most efficient method to locate a host create copies and spread to other hosts

Usually viral infection occurs when a virus enters the host

It is usually only after a virus enters a host that it can gain access to cells in order to invade

In order for the virus to make copies and infect it must enter cells of the host animal and use those cells materials In order to enter the cells proteins found on the surface of the virus interact with proteins of the cell Attachment or broken wikt linkadsorptionadsorption occurs between the viral part and the host cell membrane A hole forms in the cell membrane then the virus particle or its genetic contents are released into the host cell where viral reproduction may start

Next a virus must take control of the host cells replication mechanisms It is at this stage a distinction between susceptibility and permissibility of a host cell is made Permissibility determines how the infection will progress After control is taken by the virus and the environment is set for the virus to begin making copies of itself replication occurs quickly

After a virus has made many copies of itself it usually has used up the cells resources The cell is now no longer useful to the virus therefore it must find a new host The process by viral copies are released to find new hosts is called shedding This is the final stage in the viral life cycle

Some viruses can hide inside another cell either to defend itself against the host cell defenses or immune system or because it is not in the best interest of the virus to make more copies at the time This hiding is called latency During this time the virus will not produce any copies it will remain inactive until external stimuli prompts it into activation or the redtart of the life cycle

  

Empathy is a word that means that someone is able to share or understand the emotions and feelings of another person Someone may need to have a certain amount of empathy before they are able to feel compassion The word was coined in 1909 by the English psychologist EB Titchener

Empathy is an ability with many different definitions They cover a wide spectrum ranging from caring for other people and having a desire to help them to experiencing emotions that match another persons emotions to knowing what the other person is thinking or feeling to blurring the line between self and other Below are definitions of empathy

Empathy is found in many perhaps all mammals and may be essential part of our life It does help the group as well as the individual Lack of empathy is found in various types of mental disorder such as psychopathy narcississtic personality disorder and sadistic personality disorder

Wilhelm Conrad Rntgen was a German physicist who discovered X rays 

He was the first person to win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 Rntgens X rays were called Rntgen rays at first 

This discovery was important for medical diagnosis It also made other important discoveries possible such as that of radioactivity Radioactivity was discovered in 1898 by Antoine Henri Becquerel Marie and Pierre Curie did most research about it All three were awarded the Nobel prize in 1903 

Rntgen studied at the University of Zurich He received his PhD in 1868 He then worked as an assistance at the universities of Strasbourg and Wrzburg

Seed growth or germination is when a seed starts to grow A plant needs these things to grow air sunlight water and nutrients There are different types of germination these are by wind blowing the seeds seeds bursting being stuck onto animals fur and through water

Antoine Henri Becquerel was a French physicist He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 with Marie Curie and Pierre Curie for his discovery of radioactivity in 1898 The SI unit becquerel is named after him One becquerel is equal to one radioactive decay process per second 

Philosophical skepticism is a school of philosophical thought that began in Ancient Greece and a method that crosses many different cultures Many skeptics examine the meaning systems of their times and this can often result in a position of doubt This skepticism can be either disbelief in philosophical solutions agnosticism or even rejecting the reality of the outside world One kind of scientific skepticism talks about looking into claims that lack evidence that can be seen

In Islamic philosophy philosophical skepticism was started by Al Ghazali known in the West as Algazel as a part of the orthodox Ashari school of Islamic theology It has been said that Rene Descartes ideas in Discourse on the Method may have been influenced by Al Ghazli

King River is a river in the north east of Victoria Australia It flows into the Ovens River and which then joins the Murray River at Echuca The King River is used for kayaking with many level two and three rapids In 2008 it was the site for the Victorian and Australian Downriver Championships The King Valley is a beautiful cool climate wine grape growing area 

The King Valley has been described as a little part of Italy set in the hills of north east Victoria south of Wangaratta This area has a history which includes bushrangers the Chinese and Italians The Chinese came from the gold fields in the mid 1800s and worked as farmers growing vegetables and tobacco The were also Chinese merchants selling their goods as they moved around the valley in horse pulled wagons Roads in the valley today carry the names of the more important families like Mahlooks Honey and Fosangs

The Italians came to the area in the 1940s and 50s and like the Chinese grew tobacco They soon saw that it was a good place to grow wine grapes The valley has become famous for its different wines such as sangiovese nebbiolo and barbera The vineyards have Italian names like Pizzini Dal Zotto Corsini Sartori Ciccone and Politini The King Valley has some of the highest altitude vineyards in Australia 

Whitfield and Moyhu are the major towns in the King Valley along the road from Wangaratta or Mansfield

The Placoderms were a class of armoured prehistoric fish which lived from the mid Silurian to the end of the Devonian period Their head and thorax were covered by armoured plates the rest of the body was scaled or naked depending on the species Placoderms were among the first jawed fish the Gnathostomata A 380 million year old fossil of one species is the oldest known example of live birth 

The Placoderms were hugely successful in the Devonian period which is sometimes called the Age of Fish In the Upper Devonian a series of extinction events devastated the marine fauna As the placoderms were predators this caused a swift decline in their numbers and the class was entirely extinct by the end of the Devonian 

The main source of placoderm fossils is the Old Red Sandstone continent which in the Devonian was a united North America and western Europe Fossils from these strata in Scotland were collected since the 18th century and Louis Agassiz wrote the first survey of fossil fish A century later Eric Stensi showed that placoderms were genuine jawed fish Remarkable fossils have more recently been found in the Gogo formation of northern Western Australia This is a former Upper Devonian reef system where well preserved fossils of 25 species have been found The relationship between the placoderm and other jawed fish is still not clear The placoderms were mostly benthic predators near the bottom of the water column The largest types such as Dunkleosteus and Gorgonichthys were 6 metre long top predators in the middle and upper pelagic zones

Ixia is a genus of plants in the family Iridaceae

All of these plants are herbs with corms The plants grows in South Africa In total there are 40 60 species

Common names for this kind of flower are Corn lily and African Corn Lily and Wand flower

Some species of Corn lilies are cultivated as garden plants and houseplants 

Teleosts are the dominant fish of the present day They arose in the Mesozoic era and include 20000 living species 

They are in order of evolution vertebrates jawed fish bony fish and ray finned fish

A single species of fish from the Jurassic Pholidophorus bechii is thought to be the sister group of the 25000 strong species of fossil and living teleosts 

This is in opposition to the view that Pholidophorus was itself a teleost and the group originated in the Triassic

Fresh water is water that does not have a lot of salt in it

When people say fresh water they are most likely talking about water from the lakes rivers snow and ice It also can mean water that people can drink Although to drink the water from the snow completely frozen first without a little melted is very bad for you The oceans and seas are made up of salt water which people cannot drink However people cannot drink all fresh water because it might not be clean and might have bacteria inside it which are little living things that can cause diseases Fresh water that people can drink safely is called potable water

WrestleMania XXVII was the twenty seventh yearly WrestleMania professional wrestling pay per view event made by World Wrestling Entertainment It took place at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta Georgia

In September 2009 it was reported that the city of Atlanta was wanting to have WrestleMania XXVII at the Georgia Dome A press conference was held on February 1 2010 at the Georgia Dome to officially announced the event for Atlanta this will be the first WrestleMania to be held in the state of Georgia Along with WrestleMania XXVII a group of events known as WrestleMania Week will be held in the week before the event including WrestleManias yearly WrestleMania Axxess fan convention the 2011 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony the fourth yearly WrestleMania Art showing and auction and a Celebrity Pro Am Golf tournament According to the president of the Atlanta Sports Council Gary Stokan WrestleMania Axxess is planned to be held at the Georgia World Congress Center while the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony will take place either at the Fox Theatre or at Philips Arena

Between 15 and 20 cities were thought of to host the event with fewer than half of the people thought of invited to explain why they should hold the event at WWEs headquarters at Stamford Connecticut Atlantas main rival to hosting the event was the city of Miami Florida who wanted to host the event at Sun Life Stadium along with WrestleMania Axxess at the Convention Center and the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony at the American Airlines Arena Miami was later given WrestleMania XXVIII

During the pay per view Justin Roberts announced a new Georgia Dome entertainment attendance record of 71617 But a Billboardcom article claims a Backstreet Boys concert had 73337 people in attendance WWE says in their official press release that the Backstreet Boys concert only had 65658 people in attendance WWEs number was later confirmed by officials at the Georgia Dome

Enthalpy is a concept used in science and engineering when heat and work need to be calculated

In the study of heat both in engineering and chemistry enthalpy is a useful measure that scientists have developed to find out how much work has been done or heat absorbed when a gas changes its size at a constant pressure 

The name comes from the Greek word enthalpos meaning to put heat into The idea and the word was made up by the Dutch scientist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in 1909

Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA is a bacterium that causes infections in different parts of the body Its tougher to treat than most strains of staphylococcus aureus  or staph  because its resistant to some commonly used antibiotics

The symptoms of MRSA depend on where youre infected Most often it causes mild infections on the skin causing pimples or boils or pus But it can also cause more serious skin infections or infect surgical wounds the bloodstream the lungs or the urinary tract

Though most MRSA infections arent serious some can be life threatening Many public health experts are alarmed by the spread of tough strains of MRSA Because its hard to treat MRSA is sometimes called a super bug

Garden variety staph are common bacteria that can live on our bodies Plenty of healthy people carry staph without being infected by it In fact 25 30 of us have staph bacteria in our noses

But staph can be a problem if it manages to get into the body often through a cut Once there it can cause an infection Staph is one of the most common causes of skin infections in the US Usually these are minor and dont need special treatment Less often staph can cause serious problems like infected wounds or pneumonia

Staph can usually be treated with antibiotics But over the decades some strains of staph  like MRSA  have become resistant to antibiotics that once destroyed it MRSA was first discovered in 1961 Its now resistant to methicillin amoxicillin penicillin oxacillin and many other antibiotics

While some antibiotics still work MRSA is constantly adapting Researchers developing new antibiotics are having a tough time keeping up

A colony in biology refers to a life style or habit where members of the same species live together 

Usually the members of a colony are genetically linked by common heredity Sometimes as in bryozoa they are genetically identical clones sometimes as in eusociality they are members of an extended family Sometimes as with the Portuguese Man o War the members of the colony are joined together as one individual which operates as a single unit

Most of the colonies in the groups listed below build a common structure or nest Sometimes they are linked only by their behaviour The close integration of termites ants bees and wasps is called eusocial

The term applies mostly to animals though there are some protists and prokaryotes which live as colonies

Samson redirects here For other uses please see Samson

Samson Shimshon Standard imon Tiberian imn meaning of the sun maybe saying he was strong or One who Serves God or Shamshoun or Sampson is the third to last of the Judges of the ancient Children of Israel mentioned in the Tanakh and the Talmud He is described in the Book of Judges chapters 13 to 16 The Book of Samson also appear in Josephuss Antiquities of the Jews written in the last ten years of the 1st Century AD as well as in works by Pseudo Philo written slightly earlier Samson is a person known for being given great strength by God to use against those who do not like him and to do great things that regular people cannot do killing a lion with his bare hands defeating a whole army with only a donkeys jawbone to fight with and making a temple fall down He is believed to have been buried in Tel Tzora in Israel above the Sorek valley There stand two large gravestones of Samson and his father Manoah Nearby stands Manoahs altar It is located between the cities of Zorah and Eshtaol

Samsons father Manoah and his wife had been trying to have a baby for many years when an angel showed up in front of their house The angel told them that they were to have a son who was to be a Nazarite The child was to never cut his hair drink wine or touch a dead person A while later Samson was born and he obeyed the Nazarite laws just as the angel said

Samson saw a pretty Philistine woman while he walked through Timnah So he went to ask permission from her father to marry her The Philistines at the time were the enemies of the people in Israel so he had no idea of how his father would react Later a lion jumped on him He killed the lion with his bare hands After this he told the Philistine woman that he wanted to be her husband After the wedding however Samsons new wife was given to another man Later Samsons wife and father in law were burned to death

Later Samson found another attractive Philistine woman Her name was Delilah Little did he know that she would betray him to the Philistines She tried many times to get the secret behind his great strength This made Samson very annoyed with her After a long time Samson told Delilah that he would become weak if his hair was cut

After getting the information from her husband Delilah told the Philistine army Samsons secret She sang him to sleep at her feet and called a man to shave Samsons head After receiving his haircut Samson was tied up while still asleep He woke up and tried to break free from the ropes they tied him down with but without success The Philistines poked his eyes out with their swords and took him to Gaza where he was put in prison 

While in prison Samson worked on a treadmill a machine used to grind grain He did this for an unknown period of time that was not written in the Bible However his hair grew long again and he was taken to a temple honoring the Philistine god Dagon It was here that he performed for the worshippers While on stage Samson told a young boy nearby to move him in between two pillars He pushed the pillars apart with his full strength causing the temples roof to fall down on top of himself and the his Philistine audience Samson died from doing this but he ended up killing twelve thousand of his enemies defeating more Philistines in the event of his death than during his life

The term nontheism was first used by G J Holyoake in 1852 He used it because of the bad associations with the term atheism

Today about 23 of the worlds population describes itself as atheist About 119 is described as nontheist Between 64 and 65 of Japanese describe themselves as atheists agnostics or non believers and up to 48 in Russia The percentage of such people in European Union member states ranges between 6 and 85

A beating heart cadaver is the body of a dead person that has been hooked to a medical ventilator This will keep the organs of the dead body including the heart functioning and alive for a few days

The procedure for caring for a beating heart cadaver is the same as caring for a normal patient The body must be monitored at all times and if necessary life saving procedures must be taken Since the brain does not work the hormone levels and blood pressure must be controlled by doctors to keep the organs alive Measures must be taken to prevent infection and maintain normal tissue oxygenation

A beating heart cadaver is kept alive in order to keep its organs from decaying before they can be transplanted Surgeons will remove the organs one after the other and give them to their patients The entire recovery process is usually completed within four hours This process was formerly known as an Organ Harvest but the name has since changed to the milder Organ Recovery Many organs can be used and many lives can be saved by one body The bodies are generally organ donors who have agreed beforehand to donate their organs Some donated organs are taken from non heart beating donors Organs from brain deaths however have a better success rate and currently most organ donation is from these deaths

A beating heart cadaver is often disturbing and confusing Because the heart is beating and it is warm people may have difficulty believing it is dead Families often like to see the body once it has been removed from the machines and put to rest

A free radical is a molecule with an unpaired electron The molecule is reactive and seeks another electron to pair This initiates an uncontrolled chain reaction that can damage the natural function of the living cell causing various diseases Free radicals are involved in the mechanisms of damage associated with disease development Examples are hydrogen peroxide hypochlorite nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide

The Attack on Pearl Harbor was a surprise attack by Japan against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor Hawaii on the morning of December 7 1941 It is what led the United States into World War II Japan carried out the attack so that the US Pacific Fleet which was a collection of ships that the United States could use in a war would not enter the war that Japan was planning in Southeast Asia against Britain and the Netherlands as well as the US in the Philippines The attack was made up of two aerial attack waves totaling 353 aircraft launched from six Japanese aircraft carriers 2390 people died in the attack Japan declared war on the United States the same day

The next day United States president Franklin D Roosevelt gave a speech to Congress In his speech President Roosevelt said that December 7 was a day which would will live in infamy Most Americans listened to the speech on the radio A few minutes after the speech ended Congress voted to declare war on Japan Only one member of Congress Jeanette Rankin voted no Three days later Germany also declared war on the United States

Rumors started blaming Japanese Americans for knowing about the attacks ahead of time and even helping Many American citizens became afraid of Japanese Americans As a result many Japanese Americans were sent to internment camps in 1942 The government apologized for doing this in 1988

Pavlova is a meringue based dessert named after the Russian ballet dancer Anna Pavlova It is a cake with a crispy crust and soft light inside 

People believe the dessert was made to celebrate one of the dancers tours to Australia and New Zealand in the 1920s The two countries have argued for a long time over where it was created

The dessert is very popular in both countries and often eaten on special occasions It is usually served with cream and fruit

Research shows that the pavlova was first made in New Zealand Keith Money wrote that a New Zealand chef in a hotel in Wellington New Zealand created the dish when Pavlova visited as part of her world tour in 1926

Professor Helen Leach who studies the history of food at the University of Otago in New Zealand collected 667 pavlova recipes Her book The Pavlova Story A Slice of New Zealands Culinary History says that the first Australian pavlova recipe was made in 1935 and the recipe in the rural magazine NZ Dairy Exporter Annual was made in 1929 

The Australian website Australian Flavour gives an even earlier date 1926 when Home Cookery for New Zealand by E Futter had a recipe for Meringue with Fruit Filling The recipe was almost the same as a pavlova 

A meringue is a type of dessert made from whipping egg whites and sugar Some meringue recipes also ask for cream of tartar or cornstarch to hold it together Meringues are often flavoured with vanilla and a small amount of almond or coconut extract They are light airy and sweet

People do not agree whether meringue was invented in the Swiss town of Meiringen by an Italian chef named Gasparini They are more sure that the name meringue was first seen in 1692 in a cookbook by Franois Massialot The word meringue was first used in English in 1706 in an English translation of Massialots book There are two English recipe books that have a recipe for meringue but it is called white biskit bread in the book of recipes started in 1604 by Lady Elinor Fettiplace or called pets in the manuscript of collected recipes written by Lady Rachel Fane

There are many types of meringue The usual type is dry and crisp

One type is the half cooked type on queen of puddings key lime pie and lemon meringue pie There are also uncooked meringues and other types of meringues cooked in different ways

Cooked meringue cannot be refrigerated or it will become soggy They will keep for at least a week if stored in an airtight container

Meringue is also used as a topping on other desserts such as angel food cake pavlova and baked Alaska

Animals that are dangerous or foul to eat usually advertise the fact This is called warning colouration or aposematism It is the exact opposite of camouflage Warning colours tend to be some combination of red yellow black and white

Alfred Russel Wallace a British naturalist explained it this way in 1889

It is therefore important that they should not be mistaken for defenceless or eatable species since they might suffer injury or even death before their enemies discovered the danger or uselessness of their attack They require some signal or danger flag which shall serve as a warning to would be enemies 

Wallace predicted that birds and other predators would reject conspicuous prey whilst accepting cryptic prey Later reports confirmed this

Animals with warning colours move slowly and expose themselves to sight The sluggishness and exposure helps to advertise their defence Along with the colour and behaviour often goes the foul smell of their chemical weapons Noxious caterpillars often have thick leathery cuticles which help them to resist young birds making a test When the bird takes a peck disgusting fluid seeps out from special glands on its back The caterpillar will often survive such an attack and the young bird has learnt a lesson it will never forget All in all the predator is given good warning Tests show that warning colours definitely do deter predators

Some individual animals will die or receive damage while birds or mammals on the attack learn about the connection between colour and taste However if warning costs less than hiding the animal benefits And the advertising traits such as colours may serve other functions as well The patterns may help mate identification within the species for instance

Warning colouration is the basis of two different kinds of mimicry Mllerian mimicry and Batesian mimicry

There are a number of predators which eat toxic animals Cases which have been studied suggest there is some kind of cost to be borne for their relative immunity to the toxin

The Rough skinned newt is toxic and displays its warning colour by showing its abdomen Throughout much of the newts range the common garter snake is resistant to the toxin In several populations these snakes successfully prey upon the newts Toxin resistant garter snakes are the only known animals that can eat these newts and survive

The snakes resistance to the toxin has resulted in a selective pressure that favours newts which produce more potent levels of toxin Increases in newt toxicity then apply a selective pressure favouring snakes with mutations conferring even greater resistance The price paid by the snakes is that their digestion and body metabolism is slower than related species Really resistant snakes have slower crawl speeds than snakes with little or no resistance

This is an example of co evolution This cycle of a predator and prey co evolving is sometimes called an evolutionary arms race In this case it results in the newts producing levels of toxin far in excess of what is needed to kill any other conceivable predator

Animals can and do show bright colours which have other functions The most common functions are

However the bright colours used for these functions tend to be different from the standard warning patterns and colours 

The colouring of many species has unknown function This is usually because their life habits have not been studied sufficiently and because no field tests have been done One example is the extraordinary moth Utetheisa pulchella the Crimson Speckled Moth Its association with the plant Dittrichia viscosa which has a somewhat unpleasant smell suggest the moth has warning colouration but the matter is not settled The related species Utetheisa ornatrix which feeds on other plants is known to exude alkaloids to put predators off

A Sawfly is an insect belonging to suborder Symphyta of the Order Hymenoptera The sawflies are a group of largely plant eating insects The group is less specialised than the ants bees and wasps

Sawflies are distinguishable from most other Hymenoptera by the broad connection between the abdomen and the thorax and by their caterpillar like larvae The common name comes from the saw like appearance of the ovipositor which the females use to cut into the plants where they lay their eggs Large populations of certain sawfly species can cause substantial economic damage to forests and cultivated plants 

The Xyelidae is a small family of sawflies known from fewer than 50 extant species in 5 genera with an extensive fossil record They are the oldest fossil Hymenoptera dating back to the Triassic some 200 million years ago 

Most species occur in the Northern hemisphere especially in boreal regions though there are a few neotropical species Most are associated with conifers where the larvae feed on pollen or within buds though larvae of a few species feed on the leaves of deciduous trees

Protectionism means that a country has laws or other rules that make it easier for their own products and brands to sell by making goods from foreign countries more expensive or harder to get

The idea of protectionism is to stop outsourcing

For example if farmers from China selling wheat at a lower price than American farmers are Americans would buy more wheat from Chinese farmers than American farmers and American farmers would lose money because they cannot compete with China

The benefits to protectionism is that some people in a country would make more money because they would be able to sell things at higher prices but on the other hand other people would lose money because they wouldnt be able to buy the things from other countries that sell them cheaper

Many protectionists support a lot of tariffs because the government can get a lot of money from the tariffs 

When a country raises a tariff on another country usually the other country raises their tariffs on that country to get even This is called a trade war

Tariffs were popular in the United States during the 1800s but when the United States made the Hawley Smoot Tariff a law in 1930 it raised tariffs very high on Europe In response Europe raised its tariffs on the United States which resulted in a trade war Many economists and historians believe that the tariffs made the Great Depression worse

Protectionism is no longer popular now Instead people support free trade

David Crockett was an American frontiersman soldier politician and folk hero He is more often called Davy Crockett He also has the nickname King of the Wild Frontier He represented the state of Tennessee in the US House of Representatives He was part of the Texas Revolution He died in the Battle of the Alamo

Crockett was born in Tennessee A broken wikt linkreplicareplica of the cabin he was born in stands today in Davy Crockett Birthplace State Park in Tennessee The Crockett familys name comes from the name Monsieur de la Croquetagne Monsieur de la Croquetagne was a captain in the Royal Guard of French King Louis XIV The family became Protestants and ran away from France in the 17th century Crockett did not have an easy childhood He traveled around a lot and had a lot of adventures He started hunting with his brothers before his ninth birthday A little after he started going to school he beat up a bully He stopped going to school so that his teacher would not punish him His teacher told his father that Crockett was not at school He then ran away from home so that his father would not beat him He started moving around Tennessee This was all according to a book Davy Crockett wrote about himself

He came back home when he was 15 His family welcomed him back He married Mary Finley a day before his twentieth birthday They had three children However Polly died at a young age He married another woman named Elizabeth Patton in 1815 They had three children together

Crockett served in the Tennessee Militia for a few years then ran for Congress in 1824 He lost his election but ran again in the next election In 1826 he was elected to the United States House of Representatives As a Congressman he became angry about President Andrew Jacksons Indian Removal Act which forced Native Americans to leave their land He lost his re election in 1830 However he ran again in 1832 and won

In 1834 he wrote a book about himself called A Narrative of the Life of David Crockett Written by Himself He lost his re election to Congress that year and in 1834 he lost in an election again

Around December 1834 Crockett told some of his friends that he might move to Texas if Martin Van Buren became the next president of the United States The next year he talked to his friend Benjamin McCulloch about going to Texas which belonged to Mexico at that time with some people to fight in a revolution against Mexico Van Buren was elected president so he left Tennessee on Nov 1 1835 with three other men to go to Texas saying You may all go to hell and I will go to Texas

He arrived in Nacogdoches Texas in early January 1836 On January 14 1836 Crockett and 65 other men signed an oath before Judge John Forbes to the Provisional Government of Texas for six months that said I have taken the oath of government and have enrolled my name as a volunteer and will set out for the Rio Grande in a few days with the volunteers from the United States Each man was promised about 4600 acres of land

He showed up at the Battle of the Alamo on February 8 There were over 100 other men there On February 23 a Mexican army led by General Antonio Lpez de Santa Anna showed up and the Mexican army surrounded the Alamo ready to take it over After the Mexican army had been there for eight days 32 other men showed up to help Crockett and the other men defending the Alamo

On March 6 after the Mexican army had been there for 12 days the Mexican army attacked just before dawn while the defenders were sleeping According to Susana Dickinson before running to his post Crockett stopped in the chapel to pray When the Mexican soldiers made it over the walls of the Alamo the defenders stayed behind the low wall in front of the church using their rifles as clubs and using knives because they did not have time to reload their guns After firing shots and charging with bayonets Mexican soldiers pushed the few remaining defenders back toward the church The Battle of the Alamo lasted almost 90 minutes All of the men defending the Alamo died including Davy Crockett That evening the Mexican army lit a fire and burned the bodies of the men who defended the Alamo to ashes

Even while he was still alive many books and plays were written about Crocketts life some of which stretched the truth Since his death he has become a popular figure in American folklore In the 1950s there was a television show about him which had a song called The Ballad of Davy Crockett which was very popular Many children wore coonskin hats to look like him

Early Christianity is known as the Christianity of around the three centuries between the time of the Crucifixion of Jesus and the First Council of Nicaea in 325

Since the 19th century historians have learned more about the early Christian community Books written early in the time period such as the Didache and the Gospel of Thomas as well as parts from the Jewish Christian Gospels have been found again in the last 200 years

In the beginning of Christian History the Christian church was located in Jerusalem in an upper room perhaps where the Cenacle is today and leaders included James Peter and John The major source for the Apostolic Age is the Acts of the Apostles but its historical correctness is in question Following the Great Commission the missionary actions of the Apostles including Paul of Tarsus who said the title of Apostle to the Gentiles spread Christianity to cities in the Hellenistic world such as Alexandria and Antioch and also to Rome and even beyond the Roman Empire The term Christian was first appies to members of the church at Antioch according to bibleverseActs1126 The New Testament includes letters written by Paul to churches such as those in Thessalonica and Corinth during the years 50 62 see also Seven Churches of Asia Early Christians continued the Jewish practice of respect for the Jewish Scriptures using the Septuagint translation of Hellenistic Judaism that was in general use among Koine Greek speakers or the Targums in use among Aramaic speakers but added to it their own writings

The White Australia Policy was the name given to a number of a laws that stopped non Europeans from coming to live in Australia These laws started in 1901 and were undone from the 1950s to 1970s 

In 1901 98 of people living in Australia were of European background with white skin and with British laws and customs The government wanted to keep Australia this way This had an influence on the type of people living in Australia In 2001 many Australians claimed to have fathers from Europe About six percent were Asian and about two percent were Aborigines Most of the remaining 92 were EuropeanproofdateJanuary 2012

In the 1850s many Chinese people mainly men came to Australia to search for gold This lead to anti Chinese riots on the goldfields at Lambing Flat in New South Wales and at the Buckland River diggings in Victoria The Victorian government tried to stop more Chinese from arriving by charging a special tax of 10 for every Chinese person who came on a ship to Victoria In 1861 New South Wales passed laws to stop Chinese people coming and Queensland passed laws in 1877 and Western Australia in 1886 Later men from the Pacific Islands called kanakas were brought to Australia to work on the sugarcane farms in Queensland This also caused problems because they worked for much lower wages than other people The new Federal government of Australia acted in 1901 to stop certain types of people coming to work or live in Australia

Avalon is a popular song It was written by Al Jolson Buddy DeSylva and Vincent Rose in 1920 It was first recorded by Jolson and used in the musicals Sinbad and Bombo Jolsons version became 2 on the American singles chart It is possible that Rose wrote the song alone and that Jolsons name was used in the credits because he was a popular artist and helped make the song popular At first only Rose and Jolson were marked as the writers and DeSylvas name was added later

Many jazz artists have recorded the song for example Cab Calloway Coleman Hawkins and Eddie Durham Benny Goodman played the song in his concert in Carnegie Hall in 1938 The song was also played in the films The Jolson Story and The Benny Goodman Story

The melody at the beginning of the song was taken from Giacomo Puccinis opera Tosca and Rose changed it only a little Because of this a court later decided that Jolson and Rose had to pay Puccinis publishers 25000 and all later profits from the song

Radiolaria are amoeboid protists which produce mineral skeletons The skeletons usually of silica have a central capsule This divides the cell into inner and outer portions called endoplasm and ectoplasm 

Radiolaria are found as zooplankton throughout the ocean and their skeletal remains cover large portions of the ocean floor as radiolarian ooze Radiolaria have existed since the beginning of the Paleozoic era They take their name from the radial symmetry of most species They are valuable markers or diagnostic fossils because they have a rapid turn over of species This helps to identify strata and to correlate strata at different sites

Radiolaria are heterotrophs but also may include protist algae as endosymbionts

The skeletons of radiolarians are generally organized around spicules or spines which extend from the main skeletal mass Formed from the fusion of many of these spines is the outermost skeleton the shell or test Connecting this shell to the many concentrically organized inner shells are bars or beams which strengthen and support the structure

The nuclei and most other organelles are in the endoplasm while the ectoplasm is filled with frothy vacuoles and lipid droplets keeping them buoyant Often it also contains symbiotic algae which provide much of the cells energy Not much is known about the living amoebae because they cannot be cultured in the laboratory

Led Zeppelin IV is the fourth album from the rock band Led Zeppelin the real title of the album is but since its impossible to say these symbols it is normal just to say Led Zeppelin IV Some people also say The fourth album Zoso Symbols or simply call it Untitled It was released on November 8 1971 and recorded at a big house called Headley Grange in 1971 The album is the bands most famous and most successful album and also has their best known song Stairway to Heaven For this album the band used many different genres and recording techniques they had rock and roll songs acoustic songs and heavy blues songs Many fans and critics think that Stairway to Heaven is one of the best songs of all time if not the greatest as well as the album itself There are also many other notable songs on the album Rock and Roll was played in almost every concert the band did after the release of the album while songs such as Black Dog and Going to California were played for most of the shows All of the songs have become regulars on American rock radio

For this album the band chose to not have a normal name for their album so that people would just listen to the music without caring about the title and get wrong expectations Jimmy Page got the idea that each member of the band should choose their own symbol to represent them on the album title Each band member have been closely associated with their symbol during and after the career of Led Zeppelin and they have all used them after the release of the album For example John Bonham used to have the three rings on his bass drum and Jimmy Page has used the Zoso symbol on his amplifier as recent as the reunion concert in 2007 at the London 02 Arena

A heat lamp is a lamp that is designed to produce primarily infrared light Most heat lamps are electric light bulbs Often the glass of the light bulb is colored to cut out yellow and even higher frequency light

Humans can use these lamps to keep warm to warm a part of the body that is injured and needs gentle heat etc These lamps are also frequently used to keep baby chickens or other baby animals warm

An ultraviolet lamp is one that emits light mostly at a frequency higher than violet called ultraviolet These lamps are often used to kill microbes They can be very powerful so the people who work around them when they are turned on may need to wear protective glasses and keep their skin covered to avoid injury

In the laboratory pictured ultraviolet lights are turned on when the workers are gone so that anything on the table surface will be killed Besides ultraviolet light which makes up most of the light produced by these lamps there is also a little violet and blue light So people can easily tell when the ultraviolet lamps are turned on

Robert Bobby Lee Dodd was an American college football coach at Georgia Institute of Technology He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player and coach He is one of only three people to have done this

Dodd was born in Galax Virginia He moved to Kingsport Tennessee and played several sports at Dobyns Bennett High School After high school he played as a quarterback at the University of Tennessee From 19311945 he worked as an assistant coach for William Alexander at Georgia Tech Alexander hired Dodd while he was still a student at Tennessee Dodd replaced Alexander in 1945 and became the third head coach at Georgia Tech He retired from coaching after the 196667 season with 165 wins 64 losses and 8 ties in his career He also worked as athletic director for Georgia Tech from 1950 until 1976 Dodd died in June 1988 at the age of 79 in Atlanta Georgia

Dodd was quarterback for the University of Tennessee football team from 1928 to 1930 He played for its coach Robert Neyland Dodd wanted to play for Georgia Tech but was not offered a scholarship In the games that Dodd started at Tennessee they had a record of 2712

Dodd played a major role in one famous game During his sophomore year in a game against Alabama Dodd threw a touchdown pass in that game to tie Alabama 1313 Then he punted out of bounds inside the Alabama 1 yard line and Tennessee got a safety on the next play to win 1513 This was an important game for both teams since they were rivals

Another time in Dodds playing career showed the thinking he would use in his coaching career Against Florida in 1930 he got his teammates in a huddle and told them about a play he had used in high school When the ball was snapped it was placed on the ground unattended The players ran in one direction Then the center returned picked up the ball and waltzed to the winning touchdown Tennessee fans even developed a catch phrase for Dodd during his time there In Dodd we trust

Dodd was selected to be on Grantland Rices All American team in 1930 He was the second player from Tennessee to make an All American team The first was Gene McEver in 1929 In 1959 Dodd was selected for the University of Tennessees Hall of Fame and to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player He was elected in the same year as teammate Herman Hickman

Dodd had a 165648 record as head coach at Georgia Tech He led Georgia Tech to two Southeastern Conference championships and one national championship in 1952 While he was coach Tech played in 13 major bowl games The school won 9 of these games including six in a row from 1951 to 1956 His team had a 31 game winning streak from 1951 to 1953

Dodd took over the Georgia Tech football program after Coach Alexanders retirement in 1944 Dodds coaching ideas were about developing and treating his players well He did not believe in hard physical practices Instead he liked practices that were about the small details of football Dodds ideas led to winning He set the record for career wins at Tech at 165 career coaching wins including a 31 game winning streak from 19511953 He also won two Southeastern Conference Titles and the 1952 National Title The 1952 title was part of a 120 perfect season and Sugar Bowl win over Ole Miss

Dodd also understood the rivalry with the University of Georgia His teams won 8 games in a row over the Bulldogs from 19461954 They had 176 points to Georgias 39 during the winning streak This 8game winning streak is still the longest winning streak for either side in the series Dodd ended his career with a 129 record against Georgia

Dodds career included Georgia Tech leaving the Southeastern Conference The initial reason for them leaving was a feud between Dodd and Alabama Crimson Tide Coach Bear Bryant The feud began when Tech was visiting the Tide at Denny Stadium in 1961 After a Georgia Tech punt Alabama fair caught the ball Chick Granning of Georgia Tech was running down to tackle the receiver of the punt but relaxed after the signal for the fair catch Darwin Holt of Alabama continued play and hit his elbow into Grannings face This caused severe breaks in Grannings face a broken nose and blood filled sinuses Granning became unconscious and suffered a severe concussion These injuries left him unable to play football ever again Dodd sent Bryant a letter asking Bryant to suspend Holt Dodd felt that Holt injured Granning on purpose Bryant never suspended Holt The lack of punishment made Dodd angry and caused him to want to leave the SEC

Another issue for Dodd was Alabamas and other SEC schools recruiting of players Schools would recruit more players than they could have on their roster During the summer practice sessions the teams would remove extra players This would happen after the signing day which meant those players could not find somewhere else to play Dodd asked the SEC leaders to punish the tryout camps of other SEC members but the SEC did not Finally Dodd took Georgia Tech out of the SEC in 1963 Tech would play without a league like Notre Dame and Penn State during the final four years of Dodds coaching career In 1967 Dodd passed the head coach position to his favorite assistant Bud Carson Dodd continued to work as athletic director which he had first been hired as in 1950 He would not retire from athletic directing until 1976 In 1983 he said he would like to run a United States Football League team if Atlanta was given one The league however shut down before Atlanta received a team

Dodd wanted to win every game but unlike some other coaches he did not believe in risking his athletes health in order to win He believed that the most important part of college football was the college football player

In honor of the character of Dodd each year a Division I college coach who has shown leadership both on and off the field is awarded the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award This award is given by the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1959 and as a coach in 1993 In 1988 Georgia Tech named its stadium Bobby Dodd Stadium in honor of him The Bobby Dodd Institute is a group that helps people with disabilities it is named in honor of Dodd for his help to the disabled

Wrongful life is a legal action in which someone is sued for not stopping the birth of a severely disabled child In this type of lawsuit a child and the parents will sue a doctor or a hospital The doctor or hospital is sued for not giving information about the disability during the pregnancy The doctor or hospital may have not provided all the information on a genetic case before the pregnancy The parents argue that if the mother had known this information she would have had an abortion or chosen not to become pregnant at all

In the past only parents could sue for their own damages the occurred as a result of the birth of a disabled child This cause of action is known as wrongful birth But the child could not sue for his or her own damages which were often much more in terms of money and harm

In four US states the child is allowed to start a wrongful life cause of action for damages In 1982 the Supreme Court of California was the first state supreme court to permit the childs right to sue for wrongful life but in the same decision limited the childs recovery to special damages 

Most other jurisdictions including England and Ontario have not allowed the wrongful life cause of action

In physics interference is something that happens when two waves come together Sometimes the peak of one wave joins with the peak of another wave so the resulting peak is twice as high Sometimes the peak of one wave falls into the trough of another wave and the surface is then flat When waves add their effects it is called positive interference When one wave subtracts from the effects of the other it is called negative interference If two people pushed on a car in the same direction they would move the car better than either one alone That would be positive interference If two people of equal strength pushed the car from opposite directions then it would not be moved by either of them That would be negative interference

After a rain one can often see patterns when a little oil floats on top of puddles The colors will be in the order red orange yellow green blue and violet Each of these colors of light has its own wavelength and different parts of the oil have different thicknesses Part of the light from the sun bounces off the top surface in other words it bounces off the oil Part of the sunlight bounces off the top of the water The light waves from the oil surface and the light from the water surface meet back in the air and they interfere For any thickness of the oil layer some of the light waves will add and some will subtract so the result is that one color of light will be strongest thereclear

In physics intensity can usually be understood as the strength of something like a beam of light To figure out the exact intensity of a beam of light or a fire hose spraying water it we need to know how many units of light or water are coming to some area in some period of time A factory might have an intensity of 100 cars per day delivered to the loading dock A fire hose might have an intensity of 100 buckets of water per minute per open window of a certain size in a burning building

This article contain the many types of matches in professional wrestling

This match includes four wrestlers competing against each other at once The match continues as the wrestlers are eliminated one by one by pinfall or submission until there is only one left which is then the winner

A Tag Team match is a match between four wrestlers divided in to teams of 2 One wrestler of each team stands just outside the ring ropes until he is tagged in by his partner by slapping hands or lightly slapping their partners back with the ref watching This match is won by pinfall or submission

A Triple Threat match is regular match but with three competitors instead of two First person to score a pinfall or submission wins

A steel cage match is a match that literally takes place in a steel cage which surrounds the ring You can win by pinfall submission or escaping the cage by climbing over with both feet hitting the floor outside or by exiting the door with both feet hitting the floor

A Ladder match is a match where a prize is hung above the ring usually a championship belt or a briefcase with a contract inside To win you must climb a ladder and retrieve the prize Weapons are legal in this match type

A Last Man Standing match is a match where a wrestler has to hurt their opponent enough to where he cannot make it to his feet before the count of 10 the one who cannot meet the count loses There are no pinfalls or submission no disqualifications no count outs

A Falls Count Anywhere match is a match where a pinfall can happen anywhere in the arena Weapons are usually legal The types of matches often go in to the audience the hallways and backstage areas

The Asian Emerald Cuckoo ranges across Southeast Asia in Bangladesh Bhutan Cambodia China India Indonesia Laos Malaysia Myanmar Nepal Sri Lanka Thailand and Vietnam The Asian Emerald Cuckoo is a protected animal in Malaysia  Its scientific name is Chrysococcyx maculatus

The Emerald Cuckoo a bird is warm blooded and shrouded in feathers over body and wing It has a beak and no teeth The Emerald Cuckoos heart consists of four chambers just like in humans

Emerald Cuckoos reproduce by laying eggs The eggs are hard shelled and produced in a nest built by the parents Like most species of cuckoos they raise their own young

The molecular clock is a technique which estimates when two taxa diverged in evolution It is based on comparing the detailed structure of key molecules The method may be done for species or any higher taxon such as phyla Adjustments are made by using what is known of the fossil record The molecular data used for such calculations is often nucleotide sequences in genome analysis or amino acid sequences for proteins such as haemoglobin It is sometimes called a gene clock or evolutionary clock

The key assumption behind the technique is that in the long run changes in molecular structure happen at a steady rate Researchers such as Ayala have challenged this assumption According to Ayala these factors combine to limit the application of molecular clock models

Nevertheless the method is now used widely in taxonomy and phylogeny

Key lime pie is an American dessert made of key lime juice egg yolks and sweetened condensed milk in a pie crust One version uses the egg whites and has a meringue topping The dish is named after key limes but it is sometimes made with other types of lime 

The filling in key lime pie is yellow mostly because of the egg yolks When it is being mixed the condensed milk and the acidic lime juice react and make the filling become thick Many early recipes for key lime pie did not tell the cook to bake the pie because they used this reaction to make the filling thick Today because of food safety the pies are often baked for a short time The baking thickens the filling even more

Molecular evolution is the process of evolution in DNA RNA and proteins 

Molecular evolution emerged as a scientific field in the 1960s as researchers from molecular biology evolutionary biology and population genetics sought to understand the structure and function of nucleic acids and protein Some of the key topics have been the evolution of enzyme function the use of nucleic acid changes as a molecular clock to study species divergence and the origin of non functional or junk DNA 

Recent advances in genomics including whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics have led to a dramatic increase in studies on the topic In the 2000s the role of gene duplication the extent of adaptive molecular evolution versus neutral genetic drift and the identification of molecular changes responsible for various human characteristics especially those pertaining to infection disease and cognition

 Molecular study of phylogeny  Molecular systematics is the process of using data on the DNA RNA or proteins to resolve questions in phylogeny and taxonomy The idea is to place groups in their correct postion on the evolutionary tree This corrects their biological classification from the point of view of evolution The technique has already led to major changes in the taxonomy of living things including the names for higher categories which had been stable for well over a century

Molecular systematics has been made possible by techniques for sequence analysis This gives the exact sequence of nucleotides or bases in either DNA or RNA At present it is still expensive to sequence the entire genome of an organism but it has been done for over 100 species

Sequence analysis in molecular biology involves identifying the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid or amino acids in a peptide or protein Once a sample has been obtained DNA sequences may be produced automatically by machine and the result displayed on computer Interpreting those results is still a task for humans

Information from sequence analysis is used in many fields of biology It gives information on the relationship between individual organisms or between groups of organisms It shows how closely related they are

A DNA sequence is the sequence of nucleotides in a DNA molecule It is written as a succession of letters representing the primary structure of a DNA molecule or strand If functional such a sequence carries information for the sequence of amino acids in a protein molecule The possible letters are A C G and T representing the four nucleotide bases of a DNA strand adenine cytosine guanine thymine The sequences are printed next to one another without gaps as in the sequence AAAGTCTGAC

The study of RNA and proteins is more complex The overall structure of DNA is simple and predictable The study of RNA and proteins must include a study of their 3 dimensional structure which is varied and influences how they work To some extent this can be assisted by computer but has to be verified in each case

Information on sequences is kept in databases Since the development of fast production of gene and protein sequences during the 1990s the rate of addition of new sequences to the databases increases all the time

Complete genome analysis has been done on just over 100 species The work is done by a machine the DNA sequencer which analyses light signals from fluorochromes attached to the nucleotides This type of work is gradually becoming less expensive 

The Riverina is a large farming area in the south west of New South Wales Australia It has flat plains warm to hot climate and a large supply of water for irrigation This has allowed the Riverina to become one of the most productive and agriculturally varied areas of Australia With the state of Victoria to the south and the mountains of the Great Dividing Range to the east the Riverina covers those areas of New South Wales in the Murray and Murrumbidgee river systems

The Riverina has been home to Aboriginal groups for over 40000 years It was first settled by Europeans in the mid 19th century as a pastoral region growing beef and wool for markets in Australia and overseas In the 20th century the building of major irrigation areas in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys has led to the introduction of crops such as rice and grapes The Riverina has strong links to Victoria and the region was the source of much of the push behind the federation of Australian colonies

The major cities and towns in the Riverina include Wagga Wagga Albury and Griffith Albury and Wagga Wagga are home to campuses of Charles Sturt University Wagga Wagga is home to two major Australian Defence Force bases

The area of the Riverina region is not fixed but it usually includes the farming and pastoral areas of New South Wales west of the Great Dividing Range and in the drainage basin of the snow fed Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers The north edge of the Riverina is the Lachlan River catchment area known as the Central West Along the Murray to the south the Riverina border is the state of Victoria West of where the Murray and Murrumbidgee meet is the beginning of the drier Far West region

In general the Riverina is an alluvial plain formed by soil carried from the Great Dividing Range by streams between 30000 to 15000 years ago The landscape includes rolling hills to the east but then becomes flatter to the west with most of that plain reaching less than convert200mft above sea level The western Riverina is mainly flat saltbush plain

The geology of the Riverina has several troughs and sedimentary basins The western Riverina is thought to be the end of the Ballarat and Bendigo geological zone The eastern part is over the top of the western part of the Lachlan Fold Belt It is possible that the Riverina has mineral deposits including coal petroleum coal seam methane gypsum gold Cobar style polymetallic systems heavy mineral sands and possibly diamonds in these fold belt rocks and basins Riverina soils are generally sandy along the rivers with more saline grey and brown clays found on rarely flooded areas on the edge of the floodplain As the Murrumbidgee flows downstream the water and soil become more saline

The Riverina is drained by the large Murray Darling Basin Rivers and streams in the Riverina generally flow east to west As well as the Murray Murrumbidgee and Lachlan other streams include Billabong Creek and the Edward River an anabranch of the Murray Much of the water carried by these streams is taken out for other uses In 20012002 52 of the Murray and Murrumbidgee water was taken with 77 of that water used for irrigation

A phylogeny is a proposal of how organisms are related by their evolutionary historyp336 It is based on the idea that all living things are related by common descent 

The main product of phylogenetics is a phylogenetic tree This is a diagram showing a pattern of ancestordescendent ralationships Information may be related to geological periods or estimated dates A biological classification is another type of product Information for phylogeny comes from palaeontology comparative anatomy and sequence analysis

Asana is a body position in Yoga It can mean where a person sits and the way that they sit It helps to balance the mind and body It is meant to be firm yet comfortable 

That is different from sport traditionally more already helping into starts being meditation 

All the many many different body positions in Yoga are Asanas they all have their own names and every name ends with  asana such as Savasana if you do not remember the often difficult Sanskrit names you might pronounce whatisthatasana in a quite knowing way Many have names of animals  such as bujangasana or other sirssana

Hagfish are craniata in the class Agnatha or Myxini also known as Hyperotreti Even though fish are supposed to have backbones hagfish do not Because of this many researchers think Myxini should not be in the subphylum Vertebrata Their skeleton is made up of its skull which is made out of cartilage However because of its fins and gills they are called fish

Hagfish have teeth on their tongue to bite pieces of flesh from its broken wikt linkpreyprey so they use their tongue teeth to eat Hagfish are scavengers Its teeth pinch together to lock onto its food helping it tear into the flesh of dead and dying fish which have sunk to the bottom of the sea where it lives Often a hagfish will actually bore into the dead fish that it is eating removing the insides of the dead fish

Usually hagfish are only seen by men when nets that sweep the sea floor are pulled up Every fish even the dead ones at the bottom of the sea are brought up into the boat by the net In some of those dead fish hagfish are found eating The smelly fish are dumped onto the deck of ships with the hagfish poking out from their bodies When the hagfish becomes frightened at being taken off from the fish they vomit up lots of broken wikt linkslimeslime They vomit up enough slime to completely fill a two gallon bucket The reason such a small fish can make more slime than it seems its small body can hold is because the slime comes out in broken wikt linkfiberfibrous strings that quickly swell up much bigger than they were at first when they are released from the hagfishs body Their unusual way of eating and sliminess has made many people call the hagfish the most disgusting of all sea creatures Although hagfish are sometimes called slime eels they are not eels at all

Hagfish are usually about half a meter long They have long eel like bodies Hagfishs eyes are small and not very useful because the hagfish uses mostly its senses of smell and touch to find food They have four hearts two brains and no backbone Because they do not have a backbone hagfish can tie itself into a knot and slip out of that knot There are two reasons why hagfish do this Hagfish makes a slime covering that makes broken wikt linkpredatorpredators go away Lots of things such as the insides of a dead fish can stick onto the slime When a hagfish ties itself into a knot and slips out the slime is rubbed clean The second reason is for when it is eating Sometimes to tear off a bit of food from a dead fish the hagfish needs to pull very hard Tying itself in a knot helps hagfish do this

Hagfish are usually not eaten by humans However inshore hagfish known as kkomjangeo or meokjango in Korean and Nuta unagi in Japanese is eaten in Korea

In statistics a population is a set of things from which samples may be drawn This allows statistical inferences to be drawn or estimates made of the total population For example if we were interested in crows then we would sample the set of crows which is of interest The population of crows is limited to crows that exist now or in the future Probably geography will be a limitation in practice To fairly represent the whole population a sample needs to be random

Population is also used to refer to a set of measurements or values not only cases actually observed Suppose for example we are interested in the set of all adult crows now alive in the county of Cambridgeshire and we want to know the mean weight of these birds For each bird in the population of crows there is a weight and the set of these weights is called the population of weights

Biota is a common term in biology It means all the living things at a particular time or place Examples Cambrian biota Madagascan biota Because it includes all the living members of a given environment the term is used especially in ecology A similar term is biome but that refers to large geographical regions Tundra is a biome

The Short tailed Shearwater Puffinus tenuirostris is a kind of bird It can also be called Yolla or Moonbird and is commonly known as the muttonbird in Australia

BOINC or The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing is an organization that lets ordinary people to use their computers to do scientific work SETI or Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence is the most famous of the BOINC programs SETI searches for radio signals from outer space that might be a sign of alien life and worlds BOINC involves other scientific work For example it allows individuals to use their computer to find the structures of proteins a cure for the disease malaria or the very structure of our galaxy the Milky Way

The Human Rights Campaign is an organization that supports the rights of homosexual bi sexual or transgender men and women in the United States They are the largest such group in the United States with over 750000 members and people who support them The HRC works to ensure that the rights of these individuals are protected and respected throughout the United States One issue that the HRC works on is to make sure that individuals have the right to marry people of the same sex if they want

Hi all I will probably run for adminship sometime in April Thus I would like to know if there are any suggestions on how I can improve or some things I should work on before running I have asked some people the same question and now I would like to know what the community thinks All comments will be of help Thanks I onI alk I Prjec 0300 3 March 2010

Can someone point me to the discussion where we had a community consensus to change the icons for good and very good articles please I think weve gone through this before The Rambling Man 1008 3 March 2010

Frankly Im a bit tired of Obento disappearing for ages and then just popping back to redesign the Wikipedia without discussion The Rambling Man 1143 3 March 2010

I dont seem to be able to see the icons at all Weird Yottie talk 1147 3 March 2010

Related to this was there ever a consensus with the protection templates I noticed that many of Obentos edits in the last day involve changing icons on articles from tlpp semi protected to tlprotectedsemi See edits like this I do not think we ever decided to change over to his proposed templates I thought they were rejected pretty handily Also is there consensus to place those templates and the good article templates at the very bottom of articles as he seems to be doing Either way 1149 3 March 2010

For what its worth this is appears to be an indication that Obento doesnt agree with whats happened to his edits Or at least hes not interested in participating in dialogue with the rest of the community The Rambling Man 2210 3 March 2010

I have seen some users like this one that are mainly here because they are trying to get unblocked from en But wikipedia rules state

Simple English Wikipedia is not a rehabilitation centre for vandals from other sites It is not somewhere for banned users to try and get unbanned elsewhere Simple English Wikipedia is a separate Wikipedia in its own right and should not need troublesome users referred to it

Shouldnt they be blocked Just a thought I onI alk I Prjec 1936 5 March 2010

With the possible exception of cross wiki vandals there will be no wholesale blocking of users based on the fact that they are blocked in another Wikipedia To be blocked here they will therefore need to perform actionds that usually lead to blocks If I remember correctly there are very few users that are blocked for a longer time than like a month  Eptalon 2108 5 March 2010

Who is sending these users here to get unbanned For a couple of users who have claimed that this is their reason for being here I have looked for instructions to come here and behave but have found none Are EnWP admins actually publicly stating this Kansan 0251 6 March 2010

I hope this question isnt too out of place Can someone point me to a set of lists of the n most common words in English where n might range from 100 to higher number like 50000 This version of wikipedia is really interesting to me it reminds me of the simplified English sometimes used on Voice of America programs Im curious which words are appropriate and which words are much more uncommon than the ones used here

Also is there a better place for me to ask questions here This looks like its for official purposes and not for people like me

Wordlists This is a point that I made more than a year ago and Im going to remind everybody of it once more in line with the question above and the response from GriffonofWales

I write about art and architecture Why isnt the word architecture on this list It describes a huge field of human creativity and of the human experience of the environment The word environment was probably not a necessity when this list was compiled However it is now part of the vocabulary of every English speaking six year old The word create is not on the list The compiler of this list was sadly unaware that along with buying and selling and eating what has been bought creating is something that humans do a great deal of Creativity is surely just as useful a word as apparatus It is a word that I need all the time 

The list obviously needs expanding to include basic words from fields of human endeavour other than business competition distribution credit and exchange The first word that I recommend to all you editors who have obviously not sufficiently studied digested and considered this list is the word that is essential to what we are doing here 

What we do here is edit We do not simply change We edit That is the process That is the word we need

Hey all

So Ive been really busy with school and already I have done things I shouldnt have here so for that I apologize You guys have amazing opinions and I try to take all of them to heart Please note that if you think you can add to the design in a constructive matter I give you permission to do so If you need help you can contact me at my main page or shoot me an e mail if you like I will try my best to come on and be active but I need to know that I have some people here who support me The primary reason why I left last time was because it just wasnt fun to make templates nicer anymore Love and peace obentomusubi 0855 5 March 2010

Ive done this before but Id like fresh new opinions How many people like the current VGA and GA icons and how many people think and could be possible alternatives obentomusubi 0905 5 March 2010

Please indicate the number of the icon you are voting for Comments are also welcome After a week a decision will be taken and the templates updated accordingly

I think more choices could be chosen   CR90 1032 5 March 2010

As far as a quick counting exercise is concerned there seems no clear consensus whatsoever to change the status quo So unless anyone else has something extraordinary to bring to the discussion I would consider this debate closed and well stick with the icons we already have The Rambling Man 2208 13 March 2010

The project is growing and we are seeing more pages on subjects that we now need to discuss making some notability guidelines We have the general notability guideline and with that each page that we suspect may not be notable but does not meet the notability quick delete criteria we would need to discuss I posit that now we could use some additional notability guidelines for software and sports figures If you all could respond below in agreement or disagreement then based off og the interest I will draft a couple of changes for discussion Basically before I draft I want to know the interest so I dont waste my time and everyone elses time Thank you for looking Jontalk 2008 13 March 2010

Since this is on the Main Page now it would probably be a good idea if we created a vetting process criteria that the article should meet for being considered for inclusion and so forth as well as a nomination page I have no opinion either way on what these should be but we should probably throw something together Cheers Lauryn 0147 14 March 2010

Hello everyone Im sorry for wasting your time but I have a question about disambiguation pagescan you just copy paste disambiguation pages from English Wikipedia even if most of them are just red links Or do you just manually write down all the articles that are already created with the same name Classical Esther 0018 17 March 2010

Lately Ive noticed that weve had a number of users asking questions either in the mainspace or on talk pages as if for homework help or for other reference purposes Is there maybe a way that we could direct these users to the English Wikipedias Reference Desk which would be far better equipped to help them Maybe a link somewhere in our Help section or something Kansan 0024 17 March 2010

Article viewership is disappointingly low for simple Can nothing be done to advertise our wiki amongst our target audiences Is there anything in place for audience research Macdonald ross 2101 13 March 2010

There should be one for Simple English and a bot adding that tag to all our VGA and GAs articles on EnWp What do you think about that Also I think the issue is the few parents who do know about this place dont send their kids here because its not censored So what exactly is the target audience of this wikipedia How are we going to reach them SS 0741 14 March 2010

After reviewing the edits made by the bot I fail to see where it changed any from computer science stubs to technology stubs All edits were in changing stub to tech stub I think that if this bot gets approved it would have to consult with the Stub Wikiproject as to which stub type is accurate before making changes Aside from that looking at this as an initial test run it seems to be working fine Synergy 0259 19 March 2010

Colemans quartet played at a jazz club in New York City They were popular with other musicians like Leonard Bernstein and Lionel Hampton Other musicians like Miles Davis did not like his music

Coleman often played a plastic saxophone He had first bought a plastic one in Los Angeles in 1954 because he could not afford a metal one He did not like the sound of the plastic saxophone at first Now he plays a metal saxophone

Evelina or The History of a Young Ladys Entrance into the World is a novel written by English writer Frances Burney and first published in 1778 The novel first came out secretly but the poet George Huddesford revealed that Burney was the writer of Evelina in what Burney called a vile poem When it was known that Burney had written Evelina it immediately made her very famous

In this novel of letters beautiful Evelina Anville the heroine leaves her quiet home for the first time to go to London Through many dangers and delights of fashionable society Evelina grows in character and wisdom and finds love with Lord Orville This sentimental novel of romance and satire was an influence to Jane Austen and Maria Edgeworth

Evelina is actually a sequel Before that was another book that never came out in print It was the sequel of a finished book titled The History of Caroline Evelyn On or around her 15th birthday in June Frances Burney burned all of her writings Among the works she burned there was a complete work of fiction The History of Caroline Evelyn This was four months before the the wedding of Mr Burney and Mrs Allen Burneys new stepmother It is not clear why she burnt it However it is likely that she did it because Mrs Allen did not like her writing However the story of Evelina was still in her mind and she began writing it secretly When she was at the third volume she felt guilty She told her father that she was writing a book but did not explain more and asked him if she could print it Dr Burney laughed and said yes

Evelina came out in January 1778 It was immediately popular Almost everyone praised the book Dr Burney did not know who was the writer until June when Burney sister told him He read it with fear trembling but liked it He later came and praised Frances for writing so well Burney was so happy she threw herself into his arms and burst into tears

The novel begins with a letter from Lady Howard to her friend the Reverend Arthur Villars In the letter Lady Howard says that Madame Duval is going to visit England to see her granddaughter Evelina again In his reply Reverend Villars tells her about Evelinas history 18 years ago Mme Duval had been very angry with her daughter Caroline Evelinas mother when she ran away with Sir John Belmont After they had married Sir John Belmont burnt up the marriage papers and said that it was the same as if they had never married Unhappy she went back to Reverend Villars who had brought her up as he now brought up Evelina There she gave birth to Evelina and died Reverend Villars is afraid that Mme Duval might make Evelina die shamefully like her mother Caroline

Reverend Villars wants to keep Evelina away from Mme Duval so he lets her visit Lady Howards home While she is there they get news that Lady Howards son in law Captain Mirvan is coming back to England Evelina is very broken wikt linkcuriositycurious to see what London is like and asks Reverend Villars to let her go there Sadly the Reverend says yes

In London people are attracted by Evelinas beauty and doubtful birth Evelina who is intelligent but very inexperienced does not know about the rules of 18th century London society Because of this she makes many mistakes She falls in love with Lord Orville a handsome modest and polite man Another man Sir Clement Willoughby is in love with Evelina but her birth and his character make him try to broken wikt linkflirtflirt with her instead of wishing to marry her Evelina is confused and embarrassed by his behavior but does not know how to stop him

In London Evelina is very surprised to meet her grandmother and some of her cousins the Branghtons She is embarrassed by their impolite behavior and thinks that Lord Orville will never love her The Mirvans return to the country taking Evelina with them

Both Evelina and the Reverend are unhappy to hear Mme Duvals wish to sue Sir John Belmont Lady Howard writes to Sir John Belmont instead telling him about Evelina Evelina waits for the answer fearfully

Sir Clermont Willoughby comes to Lady Howards house without being invited He and Captain Mirvan dress up like robbers to play a trick on Mme Duval whom Captain Mirvan hates They tell her that M Du Bois her friend is in jail Afraid she goes to see if it is true with Evelina While Captain Mirvan throws Mme Duval into a ditch and ties her up Sir Clement Willoughby talks to Evelina privately Evelina feels very sorry for Mme Duval and tries to make Captain Mirvan stop his tricks but he only becomes angry Sir Clermont Willoughby offers to go away from Lady Howards house and leaves to Evelinas satisfaction

Shortly after he leaves Lady Howard receives a letter from Sir John Belmont He says that he is already bringing up a daughter of Caroline and that she will inherit his money Evelina is very confused and Mme Duval is furious She visited Reverend Villars and said she must take Evelina to sue Sir John Belmont The Reverend says no Then she threatens that if Evelina does not live with her in London she will not give Evelina her money when she dies To me I own this threat seemed of little consequence writes the Reverend butmy diffidence of the right I have of depriving her of so large a fortuneinduced me to listen to her proposal He tells Evelina to be careful and not only judge butact for yourself Evelina goes with Mme Duval back to London

Evelina lives with the Branghton family and is very unhappy Mme Duval is very angry to find out that she had been tricked by Captain Mirvan when she finds M Du Bois at the Branghtons house At the Branghtons house she meets a very poor melancholy Scottish poet Mr Macartney and sees him with guns in his hands saying O God forgive me Thinking he is trying to kill himself she stops him and cries O Sir have broken wikt linkmercymercy upon yourself She later finds out he had been planning to rob people by frightening them with his guns for money because the Branghtons had threatened to put him in prison if he didnt pay money to stay at their house He had fallen in love with a lady but the ladys father had been so angry they had fought and the father had become sick When he told this to his mother she told him the ladys father was actually his father who had left them long ago  so the lady he had loved was actually his sister Evelina gives him her own money and makes friends with him

She is very sad with the Branghtons however Once they visited Marybone a pleasure garden There Evelina was attacked by a drunken sailor and saved by prostitutes While she is with the prostitutes she meets Lord Orville again She is very surprised when he comes to visit her in the unfashionable part of London and again is kind to her Later the Branghtons use Evelinas name to ride in Lord Orvilles carriage even breaking its glass Horrified Evelina writes a letter to Lord Orville saying that she was sorry for what the Branghtons did and the Branghtons had used her name without even telling her She is shocked when she gets a insulting reply from Lord Orville Ohhow have I been deceived in this man Soon after she returns to Reverend Villars There she becomes very ill Worried the Reverend sends her to Bristol Hotwells a resort town at Clifton Hill with her extremely clever neighbor Mrs Selwyn

Geothermal energy is energy made by heat inside the Earths crust Its clean and sustainable This geothermal energy comes from radioactive decay of minerals and from solar energy taken in at the surface Resources of geothermal energy range from the shallow ground to hot water and hot rock found a few miles beneath the Earths surface and down even deeper to the extremely high temperatures of molten rock called magma It has been used for bathing from Paleolithic times but is now better known for making electricity

All over the world geothermal energy has been used to make about 10 gigawatts of electricity in 2007 and give 03 of the electricity needed around the world When used to generate electricity geothermal power plants typically offer constant output 

Geothermal energy is also used directly for district heating or in other heating and cooling applications Buildings in Iceland are heated in this way from the countrys many geothermal sites 

Power plants and thermal applications of geothermal energy are mature technologies whereas enhanced geothermal systems projects are a new type of application

Almost everywhere the shallow ground or upper 10 feet of the Earths surface maintains a nearly constant temperature between 50 and 60F Geothermal heat pumps can tap into this resource to heat and cool buildings A geothermal heat pump system consists of a heat pump an air delivery system and a heat exchanger a system of pipes buried in the shallow ground near the building In the winter the heat pump removes heat from the heat exchanger and pumps it into the indoor air delivery system In the summer the process is reversed and the heat pump moves heat from the indoor air into the heat exchanger The heat removed from the indoor air during the summer can also be used to provide a free source of hot water Geothermal Energy The Earths heat called geothermal energy escapes as steam at a hot springs in Nevada

In the United States most geothermal reservoirs of hot water are located in the western states Alaska and Hawaii Wells can be drilled into underground reservoirs for the generation of electricity Some geothermal power plants use the steam from a reservoir to power a turbinegenerator while others use the hot water to boil a working fluid that vaporizes and then turns a turbine Hot water near the surface of Earth can be used directly for heat Direct use applications include heating buildings growing plants in greenhouses drying crops heating water at fish farms and several industrial processes such as pasteurizing milk

Hot dry rock resources occur at depths of 3 to 5 miles everywhere beneath the Earths surface and at lesser depths in certain areas Access to these resources involves injecting cold water down one well circulating it through hot fractured rock and drawing off the heated water from another well Currently there are no commercial applications of this technology Existing technology also does not yet allow recovery of heat directly from magma the very deep and most powerful resource of geothermal energy

Many technologies have been developed to take advantage of geothermal energy  the heat from the earth NREL performs research to develop and advance technologies for the following geothermal applications

Because of the storms loop some reports said it was actually two hurricanes In Cuba the storm was one of the worst disasters in the islands history There was bad damage and thousands of people lost their homes In Florida the storm also caused damage and caused flooding in some areas It is not known exactly how much damage the storm caused However losses in Havana Cuba were over 1 million At least 100 people died in Cuba alone

On October 9 a type of storm called a tropical depression began in the southern Caribbean Sea It was north of Panama The storm grew stronger while it moved toward the northwest It became a tropical storm on October 11 On October 12 it became a hurricane The next day the storm was seen to the southwest of Cuba For a short time it was a Category 3 hurricane measured on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale The storm then hit western Cuba and crossed the island It moved over the Gulf of Mexico and slowed down

The hurricane was steered or moved by an area of high pressure to the north Over warm water in the Gulf of Mexico the hurricane quickly grew stronger It then moved in a small circle and on October 16 it reached its highest power It had winds of 150 mph The hurricane turned to the northeast and again hit western Cuba It began to move near the Florida Panhandle on October 17 The storm hit Cape Romano and moved to the north Now over land the hurricane became weaker After crossing Florida it curved to the northeast and entered the Atlantic Ocean The storm probably died out on October 23

The storm was unusual because it was first thought to be two different hurricanes This is because of the loop it made in the Gulf of Mexico One paper reported that the first hurricane died in the central Gulf of Mexico the second hurricane formed and hit Florida The storms path was debated and it was later found to be a single cyclone

On October 15 all ships in a convert500mikm area around Key West were warned of the storm Many ships stayed in harbors Storm warnings were also put up

The storm caused bad damage in Cuba It was considered one of the worst tropical cyclones on the island Strong winds and much rain caused flooding in streets ruined crops and damaged farms The hurricane affected many towns including Casilda The town of Bataban was left under water The hurricane halted communication to other areas Most of the deaths and damages were reported to be in the Pinar del Ro Province

The New York Times wrote that Cuba had probably suffered the greatest material disaster in all its history Thousands of peasants or workers lost their homes The countrys capital Havana also suffered bad damage On the coast many ships carrying valuable items sunk The storm also badly damaged goods kept on wharves Tall waves crashed on land and caused flooding Many boats were wrecked by the storm The high waves flooded about convert1mi2km2 of Havanas coastal land

At least 100 people were killed by the storm mostly because of mudslides including five people in Havana However some reports say the death toll was as high as 700 Damage caused by the storm cost millions of dollars In Havana alone 1 million in losses were reported

A ship the Holliswood became stuck in the storm in the Gulf of Mexico It left New Orleans on October 1 and was carrying cypress wood The ships crew fought the storm for days The Holliswood was blown miles off its path Its owner Paul Mangold said

A steamboat called the Harold saw the ship and rescued all of the crew However Captain E E Walls said he wanted to stay behind The Holliswood was badly damaged The crew told the captain that the ship would be unable to float in five more hours After the crew was rescued Captain Walls struggled for days without food or fresh water On October 20 another ship rescued Walls He was unconscious and thought to be dead When he was on the Parkwood he woke up but was delirious He asked to be put back on the Holliswood Instead the Parkwood pulled the damaged ship to land

At Key West Florida winds blew at convert110mphkmh Many docks were destroyed Damage in the Florida Keys was worth around 250000 and houses near the ocean were damaged Strong winds pushed water out of the Tampa Bay High waves from the sea moved over land and people had to hold onto trees to survive Some citrus crops were destroyed The wind tore the roofs off homes and shook buildings off their foundations 

Seven men died at Punta Gorda when some Cuban ships were wrecked Near there one man and a baby drowned and another died trying to cross a flooded river A French steamship the Louisiane crashed into land There were 600 passengers on the ship All people were rescued by another ship

The hurricane blew down many pine trees near Jupiter Florida One man near Lemon City was killed by falling wood However the storms effects on the east coast of Florida were not as bad as they were in other places Part of the Florida East Coast Railroad was washed out The storm blew an American ship aground at Boca Raton Three people died and the rest of the crew was stuck for 12 hours

The service sector also called the tertiary sector is one of the three parts of the economy in the Three sector hypothesis This hypothesis breaks the economy into three main areas so it can be better understood The other two are the primary sector which covers areas such as farming mining and fishing and the secondary sector which covers manufacturing and making things The service sector provides a service not an actual product that could be held in your hand Activities in the service sector include retail banks hotels real estate education health social work transport computer services recreation media communications electricity gas and water supply

The service sector is an important part of the economy For example in Australia in 2007 85 of all businesses were in the service sector In 2009 there were more than nine million people employed in the service sector in Australia which was 86 of all jobs In India there has been a huge growth in service sector businesses which made up 55 of Indias GDP in 20062007 Computer software businesses in India are increasing at a rate of 35 per year 

Increasingly service sector businesses need to focus on what is now being called the knowledge economy They need to keep ahead of other businesses by understanding what it is their customers want and be in a position to give it to them quickly and at low cost One good example of this are banks which have gone through enormous changes in recent years Using information and communication technology banks have vastly reduced the number of people they need to employ and lowered the cost of providing bank service For example an automated teller machine is able to provide basic banking services 24 hours a day 7 days a week in many different places Before this banking services were only available from the bank when it was open Many banks and building societies have joined together to form much lower cost businesses that can make more money from a wider customer base The key to this process is gaining information about their customers and constantly coming up with new services for them An example of a company trying to come up with a new service for customers is iCard which is looking at ways to link mobile phones to computers and social networking

Uzziah also known as Azariah was the king of the ancient Kingdom of Judah and one of King Amaziahs sons whom the people chose to rule after his father He was 16 years old when he became king of Judah and ruled for 52 years He did that which was right in the sight of the Lord According to the Bible at first he was a good king and had great success His fields and vineyards grew well he dug many wells and towers in the desert he defeated his enemies with a strong army and he became very powerful A seal with Uzziahs name has been found in a cistern at Tell Beit Mirsim

However he grew proud and entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense Azariah the priest with 80 other priests came to him and said Leavefor you have been unfaithfulyou will not be honored by the LORD God Uzziah became angry but while he was raging at the priestsleprosy broke out on his forehead and he had leprosy until the day he died Because of this his son Jotham ruled the palace and the people of the land He died and was buried in a field that belonged to the kings Probably because of his leprosy Uzziah was buried in a cemetery belonging to the kings but not in the tombs of the kings

In all Korchnoi was a candidate for the World Championship on ten occasions Korchnoi was also a four time USSR chess champion a five time member of Soviet teams that won the European championship and a six time member of Soviet teams that won the Chess Olympiad 

Korchnoi played three matches against Anatoly Karpov the latter two for the World Chess Championship In 1974 he lost the Candidates final to Karpov by the narrowest margin 115125 Karpov was declared world champion in 1975 when Bobby Fischer failed to defend his title Then after defecting from the Soviet Union in 1976 Korchnoi won two Candidates cycles to qualify for World Championship matches with Karpov in 1978 and 1981

The 1978 KarpovKorchnoi World Championship match was held in Baguio Philippines It was one of those events where the struggle took place off as well as on the board Korchnois status as a defector and stateless person was exploited to the full by the Soviet delegation Karpovs team was a dozen strong and only three of them were chess players They included Dr Zukhar Karpovs personal psychiatristpsycholgist whom attempted to hypnotise Korchnoi during play

There was constant controversy off the board with X raying of chairs protests about the flags used on the board hypnotism complaints and the mirror glasses used by Korchnoi When Karpovs team sent him a blueberry yogurt during a game without any request for one by Karpov the Korchnoi team protested claiming it could be some kind of code They later said this was intended as a parody of earlier protests but it was taken seriously at the time The story of these off the board struggles has been reported in detail from the Korchnoi point of view

As a sporting contest it had an exciting climax The match would go to the first player to win six games draws not counting After 17 games Karpov had an imposing 41 lead Korchnoi won game 21 but Karpov won game 27 putting him on the brink of victory with a 52 lead Korchnoi fought back scoring three wins and one draw in the next four games to equalise the match at 55 after 31 games However Karpov won the next game and the match by 65 with 21 draws For the second time Karpov had won by the narrowest possible margin

Korchnoi won the next Candidates cycle to again earn the right to challenge Karpov in 1981 The match held in Merano Italy was held in an atmosphere of political tension Korchnois wife and son were still in the Soviet Union His son was promised that he would be allowed to join his father if he gave up his passport When he did so he was promptly drafted into the Soviet army In spite of protests Korchnois son was arrested for evading army service sentenced to two and a half years in labour camp and served the full sentence After the release he was again refused permission to leave the USSR In 1982 six years after Korchnois defection his son finally succeeded in leaving the country

In what was dubbed the Massacre in Merano Karpov defeated Korchnoi convincingly by 6 wins to 2 with ten draws

Korchnoihad a vital part to play in the next Candidates cycle where he was due to play the young Soviet Garry Kasparov Korchnoi seemed to have great fondness for Garry Kasparov possibly because he recognized the situation Kasparov was in a prominent talent blocked by the Soviet bureaucracy

The match was to be held in Pasadena California but the Soviet Chess Federation protested and Kasparov was not allowed to fly there to play the match This defaulted the match to Korchnoi

However after a remarkable series of events spearheaded by the British Grandmaster Raymond Keene Korchnoi agreed to play the match in London This was a gracious gesture by Korchnoi since technically he had already won by default After a good start Korchnoi was overcome by Kasparovs attacking play and remarkable maturity

Viktor continues to play in Europe to this day living in his adopted country of Switzerland and frequently representing their Olympiad team on top board Korchnoi first played for Switzerland at the 1978 Olympiad held in Buenos Aires where he took the individual gold medal for best performance on board one
