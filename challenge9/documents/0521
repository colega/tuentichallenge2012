A ruminant is a mammal that eats and digests plant based food such as grass Ruminating mammals include cattle goats sheep giraffes bison yaks water buffalo deer camels alpacas llamas wildebeest antelope pronghorn and nilgai The word ruminant comes from the Latin word ruminaire which means to chew over again

Rumination works by chewing and swallowing in the normal way to begin with and then regurgitating the semi digested cud to re chew it and so get the most food value out of it

Rumination makes the half digested food particles smaller before they can go through the process of digestion

The primary difference between a ruminant and non ruminants is that ruminants have a four compartment stomach 

The four parts of the stomach are the rumen reticulum omasum and abomasum In the first two chambers the rumen and the reticulum the food is mixed with saliva and separates into layers of solid and liquid material Solids clump together to form the cud or bolus 

The cud is then regurgitated and chewed slowly Fiber especially cellulose is broken down by microbes

Even though the rumen and reticulum have different names they are the same functional space as the digesta can move back and forth between them 

The digesta then passes into the next chamber the omasum where water and many of the mineral elements are absorbed into the blood stream 

After this the digesta is moved to the true stomach the abomasum Digestion takes place here 

The digesta is finally moved into the small intestine where nutrients are absorbed Water is absorbed in the large intestine leaving the waste

Almost all the glucose produced by breaking down the cellulose is used by microbes in the rumen and so ruminants usually absorb little glucose from the small intestine Rather ruminants requirement for glucose is made by the liver

There are 35 billion domestic ruminants with about 95 being cattle goats and sheep

There are also about 75 million wild ruminants They can be found anywhere except for the continents Australia and Antarctica Most of them are in Europe Africa and Asia

The Bible is a collection of texts The original of these texts were written in different languages Today the collection of texts that is called The Bible is written in one language only For this reason at least some texts need to be translated Versions of the Bible are also different in the texts they include some texts are not part of some Bible versions One of the first such translations is the Septuagint which is Ancient Greek Another well known translation is the Vulgate which is Latin From about the 14th century the Bible was also translated into other languages

Translating a text is also always linked to looking at its meaning and to interpreting it A word in one language cannot be translated into a word in a different language with exactly the same meaning 

One such method of translation is called literal translation or formal equivalence Literal translation tries to be as close as possible to what is written in the original language Often this means translating each word separately There are a number of problems with literal translations First words must be added to get a valid grammar in the target language These words are not in the source text The second problem is that the reader must be familiar with the subject to understand some of the translation

Another way is to look at the thoughts and ideas of the source text and to get these into the target language This is called dynamic equivalence A translation that uses dynamic equivalence may use other words and phrases but tries to keep the meaning intact

A third way is called paraphrasing It tries to explain the concepts that are found in the text and does not even use dynamic equivalence That way paraphrasing may leave out sections of text or add other sections that explain these concepts A paraphrased text may be very easy to understand but is not suited for in depth study

Another problem that can occur with translation is that the meaning of some words may not be known This is often the case with words that only occur once in a text Such words are known as Hapax legomena Their meaning must be guessed from the context

Before the invention of the printing press texts had to be copied by hand This introduced errors After a certain time there were different versions of the same text Comparing such versions is known as textual criticism The translation of two different versions of the same text may result in two different texts

Some translators also translate the names others simply write the name as it occurs in the original

Geoffrey Burbidge was an English astrophysicist For many years he was professor at the University of California San Diego In 1957 he published a famous paper together with three other physicists about the origin of elements Many scientists disagreed with ideas that he had later in his life because he did not believe in the Big Bang theory

He started to study history at the University of Bristol but soon changed to physics because he could then get financial help from the government He went to London and got a doctorate from University College London in 1951 He met the astronomer Margaret Peachey He became very interested in astronomy and he married her in 1948 From then on they always worked together in several places They worked at Harvard the University of Chicago and Cambridge University Then Margaret got work at the California Institute of Technology while Geoffrey worked at the Mount Wilson Observatory and Palomar Observatory They both got jobs at the University of California San Diego in 1962

In 1957 he and his wife together with William Fowler the American physicist and Fred Hoyle the British astronomer wrote a 104 page paper about stellar nucleosynthesis The paper became known as the B2FH It talked about nuclear reactions inside stars showing how these reactions tear apart blocks of matter and put it together again differently It was a similar idea to what Charles Darwin had written about 100 years earlier in the Origin of Species where he had described how creatures had evolved Scientists saw this paper as the most important paper ever written about astrophysics 

Later career 

Later in his career Burbidge refused to accept the Big Bang theory which describes the start of the universe Quasars are very bright objects with a very high redshift The Big Bank theorists say that they come from places extremely far away in the universe But Burbidge thought that quasars come from nearby galaxies travelling near the speed of light which explains their redshift He thought they produced new matter as old matter was destroyed by reactions

Although many scientists disagree with Burbidges later ideas he is still thought of as an extremely important scientist He was given many honours In 2005 he and his wife were awarded the British Royal Astronomical Society Gold Medal

Between 1984 and 2000 he worked with Dieter Bohlen in Modern Talking and Blue System as part of the chorus Since 2003 he works on his music group Systems in Blue with Rolf Khler and Detlef Wiedeke

Radiation therapy is the use of radiation to treat diseases It is typically used in the treatment of cancer

Radiation therapy may help cure several different types of cancer if they are limited to one area of the body Doctors also use it to prevent tumor recurrance after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor Radiation therapy works together with chemotheraphy Radiation therapy has been used before during and after chemotherapy in cancers known to be affected by radiation

Radiation therapy is used on tumors because of its ability to control cell growth Ionizing radiation works by damaging the DNA of exposed tissue leading to cellular death To spare normal tissues doctors aim weaker radiation beams from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor providing a much larger absorbed dose there than in the surrounding healthy tissue Besides the tumor itself the target for the radiation may also include the lymph nodes that drain the area Doctors include the lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with tumor or if there is thought to be a risk of that individual cancer cells will spread It is impossible to aim the radiation beam exactly because the tumor moves as the patient breathes So doctors also expect to include some heathly tissue around the tumor to make sure that the entire turmor is hit by radiation

Radiation oncology is the medical specialty concerned with prescribing radiation This is different than radiology the use of radiation in medical imaging and diagnosis Radiation may be prescribed by a radiation oncologist with intent to cure or for adjuvant therapy It may also be used as palliative treatment or as therapeutic treatment It is also common to combine radiation therapy with surgery chemotherapy hormone therapy Immunotherapy or some mixture of the four Most common cancer types can be treated with radiation therapy in some way The precise treatment intent will depend on the tumor type location and stage as well as the general health of the patient Total body irradiation is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a bone marrow transplant Brachytherapy in which a radiation source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast prostate and other organs

Radiation therapy can also be used in non malignant conditions such as the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia severe thyroid eye disease pterygium pigmented villonodular synovitis and prevention of keloid scar growth vascular restenosis and heterotopic ossification Doctors limit the use of radiation therapy in non malignant conditions because they worry about the radiation could start new cancers

In August 2 1963 by decree 11608 was created the Mens High School of Santa Cruz after a proposal by the Rotary Club of the city and the Governor of the Department of Santa Cruz Carlos Cardoen This latter enthused Adriano Daz who donated a terrain where the High School was going to be constructed However a Sport Complex was constructed there instead

The High School started working since March 1 1964 in an old house in the street Nicols Palacios with at least 170 students distributed between 4 classes Many of these students already had approved their first or second grade in Humanities in the Pedro Aguirre Cerda High School but it was not recognized officially and worked with a group of teachers freely

The first Principal was Osvaldo Castillo who contracted normalist teachers and almost all of them had worked in the Pedro Aguirre High School 

The students of the High School appeared for the first time openly in May 21 1964 Shortly after that it was designed the logo and a standard both included palm trees characteristical in the city The anthem of the High School was composed by Ral Benavides

The European Union Commission defines food waste foods that are thrown away either because they are not needed or because they must be thrown away by law There are many definitions of waste and so there are also different definitions of food waste The United States Environmental Protection Agency defines food waste for the United States as Uneaten food and food preparation wastes from residences and shops such as grocery stores restaurants and produce stands institutional cafeterias and kitchens and industrial sources like employee lunchrooms

The definitions of food waste can vary in the following ways

The definitions are made more complex because certain kinds of waste are defined in reference to other kinds of waste Certain groups have not considered food waste to be waste because it still has applications

Large amounts of food waste can occur at any stage in the process of producing food In subsistence agriculture the amounts of food waste are unknown Very likely very little food is wasted because food is produced because of a need for food In the developed world the food industry produces food for a global marketplace demand 

Research has been done to see where food waste occurred The researchers looked at the food industry of the United States and found that food was wasted at the beginning of the food production From planting crops can be subjected to pest infestations and bad weather which cause losses before harvest Natural forces such as temperature and rainfall are the main influences on the growth of crops For this reason all forms of outdoor agriculture is subject to losses beecause of these influences The use of machinery in harvesting can cause waste as harvesters may be unable to discern between ripe and immature crops or collect only part of a crop Food is also wasted because it does not meet certain standards or regulations for quality and appearance As a result certain crops that do not meet these standards are not harvested left in the field they can provide fertilizer or food for animals

It is unknown how much food waste occurs during food processing When food is stored considerable amounts are wasted because of pests and microorganisms This problem occurs in countries where it is both relatively hot and humid These conditions boost the growth of pests and microrganisms Extreme temperature humidity or microoganisms also influence the nutritional value caloric value and edibility of crops and account for food waste The qualitative losses are more difficult to assess than quantitative ones More losses occur because the food is not handled correctly or because it loses weight or volume

It is difficult to reduce some of the food waste produced by processing without affecting the qualty of the product Certain regulations concerning the safety of foods cause food to be wasted before it even reaches the market Safety regulations are in place to protect the health of the consumer They are very important especially where foodstuffs of animal origin are processed Contaminated products from these sources can lead to and are associated with microbiological and chemical hazards

Preventing health issues is more important than preventing food waste or the reuse of foods that do not meet the standards

The Placozoa are an animal phylum a primitive form of invertebrate They are the simplest in structure of all 

The Placozoa has only one species Trichoplax adhaerens There is enough genetic diversity that it is possible that there are multiple morphologically similar species 

Although they were first discovered in 1883 a common name does not exist for the taxon The scientific name literally means flat animals

Trichoplax is a small flattened animal around a millimetre across Like an Amoeba it has no regular outline although the upper surface is always flattened The body consists of an outer layer of simple epithelium enclosing a loose sheet of cells The epithelial cells bear flagella which the animal uses to help it creep along the seafloor Between these layers is the fiber syncytium a liquid filled cavity strutted open by star like fibers

Trichoplax feed by absorbing food particlesmainly microbeswith their underside They generally reproduce asexually by dividing or budding but can also reproduce sexually Though Trichoplax has a small genome in comparison to other animals nearly 87 of its 11514 protein coding genes are similar to known genes in other animals

In the 1960s and 1970s renewed interest among researchers led to the discovery that the animals people had been studying are adults not larvae This newfound interest also included study of the organism in nature

The Sipuncula are a small phylum of marine worms The phylum has 144320 species of these bilaterally symmetrical unsegmented worms

Sipunculans are worm like animals ranging from convert2to720mmin in length with most species being under convert10cmin The body consists of a narrow front section called the introvert and a larger trunk section The introvert is retractable into the trunk 

Sipunculans have a coelom and a body wall somewhat similar to that of annelids The body wall is strong and muscular When threatened Sipunculids can retract their body into a shape resembling a peanut kernel a practice that has given rise to the name peanut worm

The most recognizable part of Sipunculan worms is their mouth which is surrounded by a mass of 1824 ciliated tentacles all of which may be inverted into the body The tentacles are used to gather organic detritus from the water or substrate and are probably also function as gills The mouth and tentacles lie at the tip of the introvert which is otherwise decorated with numerous spines or nodules In contrast the trunk tends to be relatively smooth 



Terrestrial is a term used in a number of sciences It is derived from the Latin terra meaning Earth

A table of information is a set of facts arranged in rows and columns It is a way of displaying information It requires a medium such as writing or print on paper or a computer monitor It is both a mode of visual communication and also a way to set out data 

A table consists of an orderly arrangement of rows and columns The columns and rows usually have names or labels Tables may include notes headers footers or other features Like other graphic forms such as diagrams and illustrations tables are often used together with prose In books and articles tables are often given numbers and captions 

Tables were the first way to print social and scientific data before any other kind of graphics like graphs and charts All the information about a modern society was recorded and published first as tables Marriage certificates were written tables Census results were recorded as tables and later analysed in printed tables All weather observations were published as printed numerical tables Many kinds of reports to Parliament contained tables of data Many of these methods were invented in Britain because the government collected statistics about the population and then published the results

The use of tables is widespread in all types of communication research and data analysis Tables appear in print media handwritten notes computer software architectural ornamentation traffic signs and many other places The details vary according to circumstances Tables are extremely flexible and can easily be constructed on computer and in print

Tables are not always easy to understand and there is a whole industry which takes table information and turns it into other forms such as graphs and charts for the benefit of the reader

A siphon is a long tube like structure that is present in certain aquatic molluscs Gastropods bivalves and cephalopods The tube is used for the exchange of liquids or air This flow can have different purposes the most common are breathing locomotion feeding and reproduction

The siphon is part of the mantle of the mollusc and the water flow is directed to the mantle cavity 

A single siphon occurs in some gastropods In those bivalves which have siphons they are paired In cephalopods there is a single siphon or funnel which is known as a hyponome

Desso GrassMaster is a sports playing field surface made of natural grass that has artificial fibres added to it The unique part of this system is the artificial grass fibres stuck 20 cm deep which cover 3 of the surface During the growing process the roots of the natural grass mix with the man made grass fibres They anchor the turf into a stable and even field The roots of the natural grass mix with the fibres and anchor the field to create a solid structure with better drainage and better playing comfort

Reinforced natural grass is used for stadium pitches and training pitches used for soccer rugby American football and baseball Reinforced natural grass can also be used for events and concerts The artificial turf injection shortens the recovery time for the grass

In 2010 for the first time in history a FIFA World CupTM is played on grass pitches that are partly made up of artificial grass in the Mbombela Stadium and the Peter Mokaba Stadium 

A table is a piece of furniture with a flat top supported by one or more legs We put things on a table often for a short time for example food and knives and forks etc at a meal cups for drinks a book a map writing paper when writing and things for hobbies 

We also put things on tables for a longer time for example a TV computer or decorations Often we put a cloth on the table flat on the top There are traditional ways of putting the cloth knives and forks and food on the table for meals

We can make some tables bigger for example by pulling the top out We can also fold some tables to transport them better for example for camping There are also small tables in trains and planes which we can fold or open Some round tables come with a Lazy Susan This is a rotating piece of wood in the center of the table

Traditionally tables in Japan chabudai are low sometimes round tables for tea and food

The name of the international organization Mensa is from the Latin word for table

Japanese cuisine is not the same in every region of Japan It is has two main groups Washoku is traditional Japanese food and Youshoku is western style food which has been changed by local people Japanese food has become more popular outside of Japan 

Soya beans are a very important ingredient in Japanese cooking it is used in soya sauce miso and tofu Soya milk is also used as a drink One example of a dish with soya beans in it is tofu Tofu is made from pressing soybeans into cubes and then boiling them Tofu is often in soups and stews Deep fried tofu is also used in many popular Japanese dishes for example as kitsune udon and inari sushi Soya beans also have omega 3 fatty acids that can also be found in salmon In Japan Udon is traditionally eaten on New Years Eve because it is believed that if you eat it you will live a long healthy life 

Noodles are used often in Japanese foods The dishes usually come originally from Korea or China

Japan is surrounded by the ocean so there is a rich variety of seafood which is an important part of Japanese cooking

Meat Japanese people did not eat meat until the Europeans first came Fish was the most common food 

Wasabi is Japanese horseradish It is often a green paste used with sashimi and sushi Wasabi is also used with many other Japanese foods Wasabi is sold as a paste or in powder form Wasabi powder has to be mixed with water to be turned into a paste Wasabi has a strong very spicy taste

Sashimi is very thinly cut raw seafood Many different kinds of fresh fish and other seafood are served raw in Japanese dishes Sashimi is one of them It is almost the same as sushi but it has no vinegar rice When the slices of fish are put on small pieces of rice they are called Nigiri Sushi Sashimi is artistically arranged and put on the plate on top of shredded daikon and shiso leaves The fish pieces are dipped into soya sauce before being eaten

Seaweed Seaweed has been a very important part of Japanese dishes for a long time Today many different types of seaweed are used in soups seasonings and other forms of Japanese cooking These are the three seaweeds used the most

Pointe du Hoc lies on the Normandy coast in the North of France In 1944 it was part of the biggest sea invasion in history During the World War 2 planning of the assault on Nazi captured France Allied commanders noticed the massive coastal guns at Pointe du Hoc There were six 155mm cannons in heavily armoured bunkers that could be very dangerous to Allied ships 

Pointe du Hoc had for many months been a target for many air raids by Allied planes flying from English airstrips The heavy artillery guns were barely damaged by the bombs Pointe du Hoc was surrounded by steep cliffs that dropped down into the sea Only at a certain part of the day a very narrow beach would appear at the bottom of the cliffs

The American 2nd and 5th Ranger divisions had been training with the British commandos for about 5 months and had been climbing the British coastal cliffs for training To get to the French coastal cliffs they were using LCA and LCVPs or Higgins boats manned by British navy sailors The boats were lowered into the sea a few kilomiters out to sea The British had added some extra armour to the sides of the landing crafts exchanging speed and manoverability for protection for the men that were to assault the French coast

The nearly 100m high cliff was assaulted by the American 2nd and 5th Army Ranger Divisions Colonel James Earl Rudder led the attack The assault started at 0630am when the battleship USS Texas stopped bombarding Pointe du Hoc Due to harsh weather conditions the Rangers drifted off course and spent an additional half hour in reaching the beach By then the Germans had come out of their bunkers and set up defensive positions along the ridge of the cliff The landing craft doors were opened and the men of the two divisions stormed the beach The soldiers used ropes attached to rocket propelled grappling hooks to climb the cliffs The ropes and grappling hooks were carried in a wooden box held by two soldiers The soldiers also used ladders that were attached to landing crafts and grappling hooks that were shot up from the boats

When the Rangers reached the top small groups of soldiers assaulted the German positions After reaching the gun emplacement bunkers the Rangers found that they were no longer there The guns were later found and destroyed in a field a bit inland

At the end of the assault the Rangers were forced to defend Pointe Du Hoc from constant counterattacks until they were relieved by the 5th Army Corps coming from a neighboring beach Out of the 225 original attackers only 90 remained

Entoprocta or Kamptozoa is a phylum of tiny sessile aquatic animals ranging from 01 to 7 millimetres long Mature individuals are goblet shaped on relatively long stalks They are filter feeders with a crown of tentacles whose cilia generate water currents towards the mouth Both the mouth and anus lie inside the crown The superficially similar Bryozoa have the anus outside a crown of hollow tentacles Most families of entoprocts are colonial and all but 2 of the 150 species are marine A few solitary species can move slowly

Some species eject unfertilized ova into the water while others keep their ova in brood chambers until they hatch and some of these species use placenta like organs to nourish the developing eggs After hatching the larvae swim for a short time and then settle on a surface There they metamorphose and the larval gut generally rotates by up to 180 so that the mouth and anus face upwards Both colonial and solitary species also reproduce by cloning

Some species of nudibranchs and flatworms prey on entoprocts A few entoproct species have been found living in close association with other animals 

Fossils of entoprocts are very rare and the earliest specimens that have been identified with confidence date from the Upper Jurassic Most studies from 1996 onwards have regarded entoprocts as members of the Trochozoa which also includes molluscs and annelids However a study in 2008 concluded that entoprocts are closely related to bryozoans

Entoprocta means anus inside The alternative name Kamptozoa means bent or curved animals Some authors use Entoprocta while others prefer Kamptozoa

The 5000 metres is a popular running distance It is also known as a 5K or 5 km Colloquially it is called a five K It is one of the track events in the Olympic Games and the World Championships in Athletics 5000 metres refers to racing on a track 5K usually refers to a roadrace or cross country event While mainly run as an outdoor event the 5000 m is sometimes run on an indoor track Official records are kept for both outdoor and indoor 5000 m track events but not for 5 km road races

Much of the distances popularity is due to the challenge it gives to both amateurs and professionals It is a distance race that demands a great deal of endurance as well as speed Strategies also play a key role and the combination makes it attractive to many

Sportcity Manchester is a sports area in eastern Manchester It became famous as host of the 2002 Commonwealth Games It hosts the regional base for the English Institute of Sport It has athletics tracks The National Squash Centre The Regional Tennis Centre the Manchester Velodrome and the City of Manchester Stadium It was also the proposed location for the SuperCasino But the plan was rejected by the House of Lords

Oakwell is a sports development in Barnsley South Yorkshire England It is used mostly by Barnsley Football Club for playing their home games It is also used by their reserve team

While the name Oakwell is usually used for the main stadium it also includes several neighbouring venues which form the facilities of the Barnsley FC academy This includes an indoor training pitch a smaller stadium with seating on the south and west sides for around 2200 spectators and several training pitches used by the different Barnsley FC squads

Until 2003 the stadium and the large amount of land that is around it was owned by Barnsley Football Club However after falling into administration in 2002 the council purchased the main Oakwell Stadium This allowed the club to pay its creditors and remain participants in The Football League

The West Stand is the only original part of Oakwell Stadium left standing however it was made all seater in 1995 

The stand is made up of two tiers only the upper tier is covered but at the expense of several supporting columns for the roof structure the seats are the originals from the early 1900s from here you get a decent view with moderate legroom In spite of the restricted views and modest facilities the West Stand remains a popular vantage point for many fans The lower tier of the West Stand is uncovered and offers a great view of the action

The roof of the West Stand is corrugated iron this also houses the main television gantry which is accessed from the upper level seating area by a temporary ladder

At the end of the 1990s the then stadium owners Barnsley Football Club were considering re developing the West Stand after several seasons of high attendances However with the rapid decline in fortunes of the football club and sale of the stadium and new club ownership these plans are unlikely to happen in the near future

The stand also has a traditional players tunnel in the centre This is used for access to some of the facilities underneath the stand The main players tunnel now comes out from the north west corner following the moving of the changing rooms to the North Stand

The West Stand has a total seating capacity of 4752

The East Stand is a two level development completed in 1993 Funded in part by the football trust the stand has a capacity of 7492 and replaced a large covered terrace known as the Brewery Stand The East Stand was designed by NYP Architectsas was the North Stand and the Corner Stand With the completion of the East Stand Barnsley FC became the first football club in Yorkshire to add executive boxes into their stadium The East stand is very modern and has plenty of legroom

Due to the sloped land on which Oakwell Stadium is built the rear of the East Stand is much taller than it is from the pitchside This means a climb to the upper level seating area requires many more steps than a spectator may anticipate However several lifts are available

Built in 1995 CK Beckett is the current name for what is traditionally known as the Pontefract Road End or Ponty End Some fans continue to call it the ORA Stand  in reference to the original sponsors of it Also known as the Van Damme Stand

With a capacity of 4508 The CK Beckett Stand is a large covered single tier seating area behind the goal on the south side of the stadium

This part of the stadium also houses the players gym the club superstore box office and general administration offices

It is understood that this stand had been designed specifically with future development in mind therefore should the club ever have the need to increase the grounds capacity then it would be fundamentally possible to add a second tier without making any major alterations to the existing structure

The North Stand is the most recent addition to Oakwell Stadium and is a large covered singled tiered seating area with a capacity for 6000 spectators

As this stand is generally reserved for away supporters its capacity is rarely utilized although during the 200607 season Sheffield Wednesday Derby Birmingham and Sunderland fans all filled the end Sunderland also took up half of the West Stand In the 200910 season Newcastle United filled the stand

At a cost of 45 million it has been a cause for debate ever since its construction However at the time it was built Barnsley FC had only just been demoted from the FA Premier League and were planning for a possible return

The Corner Stand was built in the summer of 1998 It was originally known as The Welcome Windows Stand It is an unusual three level structure It provides further executive areas and disabled facilities for viewing an event

Access to this area was also added into the neighbouring East Stand on several levels The spectator capacity of the structure is 202

In recent years Oakwell Stadium has rarely been used by anyone other than Barnsley FC The occasional celebrity charity football match has been played there

Wakefield Trinity Wildcats Rugby League Club used the stadium for their first game in the Super League in 1998

Non league football club Wakefield and Emley used the stadium for an FA Cup tie against Rotherham in 1998 choosing a larger neutral venue as opposed to the traditional option of switching the tie to the home of the team which was drawn away

Premier League side Manchester City used the stadium for their first qualifying round UEFA Cup game in July 2008 This was because the pitch at the City of Manchester Stadium was not ready for football games after the summers boxing and music concerts

In March 2008 club secretary Don Rowing revealed that the West Stand would be demolished and rebuilt Given that the average gate at Barnsley accounts for less than 50 of capacity this appeared to be a strange announcement however there are a number of structural concerns with the roof and the wooden floor of the upper tier and it would seem that a new structure is more financially viable than maintaining the existing one

No firm timescales or details of the structure have yet been released Plans for a replacement stand were submitted to the local council several years ago in this particular case the stand was to have around 9000 seats  it remains to be seen whether such a large stand would be built Given the current attendance figures then a new stand with around the same capacity as the existing West Stand would be more than viable

The Particle Theory of Matter means that all matter is made of tiny particles The particles have empty spaces between them and they move randomly all the time After that the particles move faster and move father apart when heated and they attract each other

Has a shape and volume the particles are in motion but attraction is strong the particles want to stay together and they just vibrate

 Liquid 

The particles are farther apart than a solid they can move they are free to move past each other but they still hold together from attraction

The particles are much farther apart and they are free to move the attraction is small and they spread out to fill the whole container

Velvet is a type of woven tufted fabric in which the cut threads are very evenly distributed with a short dense pile giving it a distinctly smooth feel

Velvet can be made from many different fibres It is woven on a special loom that weaves two pieces of velvet at the same time The two pieces are then cut apart and the two lengths of fabric are wound on separate take up rolls Velvet is difficult to clean due to its pile but modern dry cleaning methods perform well

Velvet is made ideally from silk More recently synthetic velvets have been developed mostly polyester nylon viscose acetate and mixtures of different synthetics or synthetics and natural fibers A small percentage of lycra is used sometimes to give stretch

The art of velvet weaving probably originated in medieval Kashmir around the beginning of the fourteenth century King Richard II of England directed in his will that his body should be clothed in velveto in 1399

The earliest sources of European artistic velvets were weavers in Lucca Genoa Florence and Venice

Nemertea is a phylum of invertebrate animals also known as ribbon worms or proboscis worms Most of the 1400 or so species are marine with a few living in fresh water and a small number of terrestrial forms They live in all marine habitats and throughout the worlds oceans Alternative spellings for the phylum have included Nemertini and Nemertinea Rhynchocoela is a name used primarily in North America but gradually abandoned since the 1980s

Nemertean worms are long thin animals without segments They have no true head although the anterior end is often slightly wider than the body They are distinguished by the presence of an eversible proboscis This is kept inside the body but pushed out to catch prey 

Nemerteans collect food with their proboscis which is closely associated with the digestive system At rest the proboscis is inside a long tube that may take up a considerable portion of the worms length lying just above the gut It is attached to the posterior end of this tube by a muscle that pulls it back inside after feeding At the anterior end the tube opens into a small cavity close to the brain and then to the outside through a pore at the anterior tip of the animal

Nemerteans range in size from 5mm to over 30 m long in the case of the European Lineus longissimus with most species being 20 cm or less There are reports of specimens up to 50 or 60m long which would make it the longest animal in the world The longest animal on record is a female blue whale 299m long

Speed reading is the name for a number of ways to increase the speed at which a text can be read so that the important facts of the text can still be understood There are different ways to improve reading speed but they are all similar A trained reader is able to read and understand between 200 and 300 words per minute for a text that is not very difficult to understand Better training can improve this speed to over 1000 words per minute Using a lot of exercise it is possible to increase reading speed further The best readers can read between 3000 and 4000 words per minute and understand about 80 of them 

In general only a small part of the letters read are seen clearly The brain guesses what the rest of the word is based on a small part of the word This also applies to groups of words which are treated the same way Known groups are handled faster because the reader knows them and also has an image for them 

What is very important when reading text is the ability to recognize words and word groups The reader will then add the known image to the context A known font can help this 

What is bad for speed reading is having a bad short term memory Another factor is a small vocabulary People who only know few words need more time to scan unknown words simply because fewer words in the text are known

Maine Road was a large football stadium in Moss Side Manchester England It was home to Manchester City FC from when it was built in 1923 until 2003 It takes its name from the street it was built on which also had a remarkable history The street was first known as Dog Kennel Lane It formed part of an ancient route south of Manchester 

When first opened the stadium was the largest club ground in England and the second largest in the country after Wembley Stadium Maine Roads record attendance was set in 1934 when 84569 people attended an FA Cup tie between Manchester City and Stoke City It is the record for an English club ground The following February the stadium recorded the highest Football League attendance This stood at 79491 for a game against Arsenal The record has since been beaten for the League but it is still Manchester Citys largest League crowd The design of the ground changed several times over its 80 year history Before it closed Maine Road was an all seater stadium with a capacity of 35150

The 2002 03 season was Manchester Citys last at Maine Road The last match was played on 11 May 2003 The following season Manchester City moved to City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester Maine Road was torn down in 2004

Plans to build Maine Road were first announced in May 1922 It came after a decision by Manchester City FC to leave their Hyde Road ground Hyde Road did not have room for expansion and had been damaged by fire in 1920 Two sites in Belle Vue East Manchester were suggested but neither was considered good enough To many City fans east Manchester was thought of as Citys home Many were disappointed when a site in south Manchester was chosen A City director John Ayrton resigned from the Board later in the decade and helped to form an alternative MCFC Manchester Central FC playing at Belle Vue 

A sixteen and a quarter acre former brickworking on Maine Road was purchased for 5500 Maine Road had first been known as Dog Kennel Lane It was renamed Maine Road during the 1870s because of pressure from the Temperance Movement 

Stadium construction began late in 1922 Plans by architect Charles Swain proposed a 120000 capacity ground based on the design of Hampden Park These plans were reduced to give a capacity of 80000 However this figure was still the second largest in the country behind Wembley Stadium leading to a label of The Wembley of the North Wembley had opened in London only a few months earlier This made a source of rivalry between the northern and southern divisions of builders Sir Robert McAlpine who built both stadia During construction the stadium was supposedly cursed by a gypsy when Manchester City officials evicted a gypsy camp from the area This curse was allegedly removed on 28 December 1998 However the gypsy curse is likely to be an urban myth as such stories are endemic to a number of football league grounds Construction took 300 days The total cost 100000 The first layout of the ground was one covered stand with a seating capacity of 10000 It had uncovered terracing on the other three sides with gentle curves connecting the corners

The first match at Maine Road took place on 25 August 1923 and saw 58159 fans watch the home side beat Sheffield United 2 1

The first changes to the ground took place in 1931 when the corner between the Main Stand and the Platt Lane end at the south of the ground was rebuilt to incorporate a roof The highest attendance at an English football game of any type at a club ground was at Maine Road on the March 3 1934 when Manchester City played Stoke City in front of 84569 fans in the 6th round of the FA Cup Changes at the Platt Lane end took place in 1935 extending the terracing and providing a roof for the full stand This marked the peak capacity of the ground estimated at around 88000 Further changes were planned but were suspended when Manchester City were relegated from Division One in 1938 and abandoned when World War II broke out

The stadium was shared by Manchester United for a period after the Second World War since Manchester Uniteds Old Trafford ground had been partially destroyed during the Manchester Blitz United paid City 5000 per season plus a share of gate receipts The highest attendance for a League game at Maine Road occurred during this period when 83260 people watched Manchester United play Arsenal on January 17 1948 This figure is a national record for a League game 

Floodlights were installed in 1953 and in 1957 prompted by the hosting of two FA Cup semi finals in successive years the side facing the Main Stand was redeveloped and named The Kippax Stand after a nearby street Over the course of the 1960s and 1970s the Kippax became the part of the ground where the clubs most vociferous fans congregated In 1963 benches were installed at the Platt Lane end meaning that Maine Road had more seats than any other English club ground of the time The next major redevelopment came in the 1970s with the construction of the North Stand a cantilevered stand which remained in place until the closure of Maine Road The 1980s saw ambitious plans for improvements however these plans were shelved due to financial pressures after the Main Stand roof had been replaced at a cost of 1 million 

By 1990 some areas of the ground looked antiquated and the Platt Lane stand was demolished in 1992 Its place was taken by the all seater Umbro Stand that also incorporated executive boxes and was opened in March 1993 The stand was renamed back to the Platt Lane Stand in the late 1990s 

The era of standing accommodation at Maine Road came to an end in May 1994 as the stadium became all seater to comply with the requirements of the Taylor Report with the demolition of the Kippax Street Terrace The final match where standing was permitted took place on 30 April 1994 Chelsea the visitors for a 22 draw Immediately prior to demolition the capacity of the Kippax terrace was 18300 A three tier stand was built in its place holding nearly 14000 spectators and on its completion in October 1995 it was the tallest stand in the country 

The new stand was an impressive modern facility but it also emphasised the haphazard nature in which the ground had been redeveloped as all four sides were of differing heights and construction styles There were further plans for expansion which would have taken the stadiums capacity to 45000 but these were put on hold following Citys relegation from the Premier League in 1996

There were plans for further expansion at Maine Road to take the capacity to 45000 all seated but these were abandoned in favour of a move to the City of Manchester Stadium that was being constructed for the Commonwealth Games in 2002

The final competitive match before the closure of the stadium took place on 11 May 2003 Manchester City ended the Maine Road era with a 1 0 defeat to Southampton with Michael Svensson scoring the stadiums last goal The final match was followed by short performances by musical acts Badly Drawn Boy and Doves 

Citys final goal at the stadium was scored on 26 April 2003 by Marc Vivien Foe who died on 26 June that year from an undetected heart condition while representing the Cameroon national football team

Toward the end of Maine Roads lifespan there were proposals for other sports teams to make use of the stadium following Citys relocation Stockport County once expressed interest in moving there from Edgeley Park and in December 2000 Sale Sharks rugby union club was offered a lease for the stadium However none of the proposals came to fruition

An auction of the grounds fixtures and fittings took place in July 2003 raising 100000 which was donated to community projects in the Moss Side area which was undergoing a lengthy regeneration process Demolition began in late 2003 taking seven months Two years later the go ahead was given for a new housing development to take part on the site consisting of 474 homes

For long periods of its history Maine Road had the widest pitch in England However the width was changed several times by managers wishing to alter the pitch size to suit their style of play In the final season before the ground was closed the pitch size was 107 x 71 metres

Maine Road hosted two England internationals the first was a 3 0 defeat of Wales on November 13 1946 and the second a 9 2 win over Northern Ireland on November 16 1949 Englands first ever World Cup qualifier In addition A number of wartime internationals were held at the ground Maine Road was also the venue for a number of rugby league matches hosting the rugby league championship final eleven times between 1938 and 1956

The stadium was used for several scenes in the 1948 motion picture Cup tie Honeymoon More recently it was featured in the 2000 film Theres Only One Jimmy Grimble and the 2003 ITV drama The Second Coming which starred Christopher Eccleston

Maine Road has also played host to a number of rock concerts including The Rolling Stones Simple Minds Queen Fleetwood Mac Pink Floyd Bryan Adams Jean Michel Jarre Dire Straits David Bowie Guns N Roses

In 1974 teen idol David Cassidy played the stadium

The most high profile concert held at Maine Road was that of Mancunian band Oasis in April 1996 a performance which was later released as a video OasisThere and Then 

Prince also played the stadium twice in the early 1990s

Maine Road also gives its name to a non league football club Maine Road FC The club who currently play in the North West Counties Football League Division One was founded by a group of Manchester City supporters in 1955 The club previously based its headquarters at the social club adjoining Maine Road

Meanwhile there was a mass flow of Rangers fans into Manchester Over a hundred thousand supporters invaded the city despite the clubs official ticket allocation being just 13000 and police requests for fans to stay at home The influx of people resulted in there being no vacant hotel rooms in a twenty mile radius of the city and the total amount of money that was ploughed into the local economy was estimated to be around 25 million

UEFA stadium categories are categories for football stadiums laid out in the UEFA Stadium Infrastructure Regulations Using these regulations stadiums are rated as category one two three or elite These categories replaced the old method of ranking stadiums as four or five star in 2006 A stadium must be categorised as elite to host the final of the UEFA Champions League or the UEFA Europa League These are UEFAs two top club competitions 

Some of the main criteria which must be met are

As well the UEFA delegate after consultation with the main assigned referee will call for the retractable roof if the weather will cause any obstacles for the upcoming game to take place

Although the minimum stadium capacity for elite categorisation is 30000 no stadium with a capacity less than 40000 has been selected to host a UEFA Europa League Final No stadium with a capacity less than 60000 has been selected to host a UEFA Champions League Final since these regulations were introduced in 2006

After the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final UEFA President Michel Platini stated that he wanted European Cup finals to be held at stadiums with an average capacity of 70000 to solve security issues Both the Santiago Bernabu and Wembley Stadium hosts for the 2010 and 2011 Champions League finals respectively have capacities greater than 70000 as does the Stadio Olimpico in Rome Italy which hosted the 2009 Champions League Final Wembley Stadium the venue of the 2011 Champions League Final holds 90000 spectators The Allianz Arena the host venue of the 2012 Champions League Final only holds 66000 spectators

Roman Fresnedo Siri Salto February 4 1903  Montevideo June 26 Uruguayan architect

An international competition to choose the most original design had been won in 1961 by a uruguayan architect Mr Roman Fresnedo Siri Siri had won acclaim for designing major civic buildings hroughout South America including offices and hospitals He also had a passion for the ocean and even used his talents to design racing yachts 

Siris spirit and originality did not disappoint From its earliest days architects and passersby alike were intrigued by surprises in the buildings construction Rising dramatically from the shore of the historic Potomac River two distinct structures dominated the triangular block of land a circular council chamber and an 11 story crescent shaped secretariat By December 1964 texture and pattern had begun to emerge giving each building a distinct character Geometric diamond shapes decorated the outside of the council chamber visually played off against the elegant vertical lines of the larger secretariat building Gradually other elements were added reflecting pools white columns and slim concrete fins that gave the buildings a soaring quality 

Just over two years after work began the completed secretariat was ready to house hundreds of staff members in approximately 170000 square feet of space furnished with marble paintings sculptures and other gifts from PAHO member nations The council chamber alone could accommodate 400 delegates within its circular walls The new PAHO headquarters was officially opened on September 27 1965

In electronics a photomask is a special stencil which is used to create a printed circuit board When light is shone through the photomask certain parts where the light hits the unused circuit board are strengthened much like what toothpaste does to the hard surfaces your teeth When a circuit board is put through an acid bath the parts where the light shone through the photomask stay in place while the parts that were covered by the shadow of the photomask are eaten away by the acid

The Gastrotricha often called hairy backs are a phylum of microscopic animals abundant in fresh water and marine environments Marine species are found mostly in between sediment particles while terrestrial species live in the water films round grains of soil About 700 species have been described

Gastrotrichs are bilaterally symmetric with a transparent body and a flat underside Many species have a pair of short projections at the rear end The body is covered with cilia especially about the mouth and on the lower surface Its two end projections have cement glands This is a double gland system where one gland secretes the glue and another secretes a de adhesive Like many microscopic animals their movement is mainly powered by hydrostatics

Gastrotrichs develop to a particular number of cells further growth comes only from an increase in cell size As is typical for such small animals there are no respiratory or circulatory organs Nitrogenous waste is probably excreted through the body wall as part of respiration The nervous system is relatively simple The brain consists of two ganglia one on either side of the pharynx Each ganglion gives rise to a single nerve cord which runs the length of the body and includes further smaller ganglia The main sense organs are the bristles and ciliated tufts of the body surface Some gastrotrichs also possess light sensitive cells in the brain that work as primitive ocelli

Gastrotrichs are simultaneous hermaphrodites they have both male and female sex organs Once the sperm are produced they are picked up by an organ on the tail that functions as a penis and transferred to the partner Fertilisation is internal and the eggs are released by rupture of the body wall

Many species reproduce entirely by parthenogenesis In these species the male portions of the reproductive system are non functional or entirely absent 

Some species can lay eggs that can remain dormant during times of dessication or cold These species produce regular eggs during good environmental conditions which hatch in one to four days The eggs hatch into miniature versions of the adult The young typically reach sexual maturity in about three days and gastrotrichs can live up to ten days under laboratory conditions

A hand axe is a stone tool of the Lower and Middle Paleolithic Stone Age It was a bifacial similar on both sides and held in the hand not with a handle like a modern axe It was held directly in the hand perhaps wrapped in a piece of leather 

This kind of axe is typical of the Acheulean and the Mousterian cultures and is the longest used tool of human history Hand axes were certainly used for at least a million and a half years They were made by earlier species of man such as Homo erectus and Homo neanderthalensis it was one of their most important tools The hand axe cultures were preceded by an even older Oldowan culture of primitive stone tools in Africa 

Lighter weight hand axes were also made by our own species Homo sapiens but we moved on to create a much wider range of tools

Hand axes are found mainly in Africa Europe and Northern Asia while South Asia retained flake industries such as the Hoabinhian

New archaeological evidence from Baise China shows that there were also hand axes in eastern Asia

Older hand axes were produced by direct percussion with a stone hammer and can be distinguished by their thickness and a sinuous border Later Mousterian handaxes were produced with a soft billet of antler or wood and are much thinner more symmetrical and have a straight border

An experienced flintknapper needs less than 15 minutes to produce a good quality hand axe A simple hand axe can be made from a beach pebble in less than 3 minutes

Hand axes are mainly made of flint but rhyolites phonolites quartzites and other rather coarse rocks were used as well Obsidian was rarely used because is is not widely found It produces a brilliant blade but shatters more easily than flint

Several basic shapes like cordate oval or triangular have been distinguished but their significance is not agreed upon

Hand axes were no doubt a multi purpose tool Research on their cutting edges has shown that in many cases they were used for butchering meat This would include extracting bone marrow and general hacking through bone muscle and tendons Experiments at Boxgrove would appear to back this up We know for sure that Neanderthals at least were hunters of large mammals such as mammoths and that may be true of other hand axe cultures The need for such a heavy tool is thus easily understood Wielding a hand axe requires considerable strangth but Neanderthals were stronger than us in their upper bodies

Studies in the 1990s at Boxgrove in which a butcher attempted to cut up a carcass with a hand axe showed that the hand axe was perfect for getting at the bone marrow which is high in protein and vitamins and thus was highly prized as a food source

Joey Scarbury is an adult contemporary singer best known for his hit song Theme from The Greatest American Hero in 1981

Growing up in Thousand Oaks California Scarbury was continually encouraged in his ambition to sing by his mother At the age of 14 after being spotted by songwriter Jimmy Webbs father he was signed to a recording contract and seemed to be destined for stardom Scarburys first single She Never Smiles Anymore flopped and he was soon without a record label 

Scarbury undaunted by what happened stayed in music up through the 1970s singing backup for artists like Loretta Lynn and occasionally recording his own material Although he had a minor chart single with Mixed Up Guy in 1971 real chart success eluded him for the rest of the decade This was to change when he started working for record producer and composer Mike Post Post was hired along with Stephen Geyer to write the theme tune for a new TV series dubbed The Greatest American Hero about a high school teacher who comes into possession of a superhero outfit and Scarbury was chosen to record it An extended version of the song released by Elektra Records shot up to 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 

Scarbury could not follow it up however and after charting at 49 with the single When She Dances Scarbury disappeared again from the charts Scarbury went on to work with Post again in the mid 1980s to record the song Back to Back for the television series Hardcastle and McCormick and teamed up with Desiree Goyette to record Flashbeagle for the Peanuts special Its Flashbeagle Charlie Brown He also performed the opening theme for the television series Jennifer Slept Here

In 1990 Scarbury found success again as a songwriter This time his co written song No Matter How High was recorded by The Oak Ridge Boys and was a number one country music hit His co writer on this song was Even Stevens who previously had found success with co writing songs for country star Eddie Rabbitt as well as the Kenny Rogers hit Love Will Turn You Around from the motion picture Six Pack

Kenny Rankin was an American pop and jazz singer and songwriter originally from the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City New York

Rankin was raised in New York and was introduced to music by his mother who sang at home and for friends Early in his career he worked as a singer songwriter and developed a considerable following during the 70s with a steady flow of albums three of which broke into the Top 100 of the Billboard Album Chart His liking for jazz was evident from an early age but the times were such that in order to survive his career had to take a more pop oriented course By the 90s however he was able to angle his repertoire to accommodate his own musical preferences and to please a new audience while still keeping faith with the faithful Rankins warm singing style and his soft nylon stringed guitar sound might suggest an artist more attuned to the supper club circuit than the jazz arena but his work contains many touches that appeal to the jazz audience

Rankin appeared on The Tonight Show more than twenty times Host Johnny Carson was so impressed by him that he wrote the liner notes to Rankins 1967 debut album Mind Dusters which featured the single Peaceful Kennys friend Helen Reddy would reach 2 Adult Contemporary and 12 Pop in 1973 with a cover of it released as her follow up single to I Am Woman Georgie Fame also had a hit with this song in 1969 his only songwriting credit to hit the British charts reaching number sixteen and spending 9 weeks on the chart

Rankins accompanists from time to time included Alan Broadbent Mike Wofford and Bill Watrous and on such occasions the mood slips easily into a jazz groove His compositions have been performed by artists such as Mel Torm and Carmen McRae while Stan Getz said of him that he was a horn with a heartbeat Rankin was deeply interested in Brazilian music and his Here In My Heart on which he used jazz guests including Michael Brecker and Ernie Watts was recorded mostly in Rio De Janeiro More contemporary songs were given an airing following his move to Verve Records including the Beatles Ive Just Seen A Face and Leon Russells A Song For You

Rankins own unique gift for reworking classic songs such as The Beatles Blackbird which he recorded for his Silver Morning album so impressed Paul McCartney that he asked Rankin to perform his interpretation of the song when McCartney and John Lennon were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame

Rankin was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in early 2009 He died in Los Angeles California  where he had resided for many years  from the disease on June 7 2009 He was 69 years old

Because of his strong Christian beliefs he refused to compete on Sundays at first Eventually he decided to do so in 1993 This decision proved important since the qualifying round at that years World Championships took place on a Sunday He went on to win the bronze medal

In his breakthrough year of 1995 he produced a jump of 1843 m at the European Cup The leap was wind assisted and did not count for record purposes But it was a sign of things to come as he capped an unbeaten year He had a historic gold medal performance at the World Championships There he broke the world record twice in the same meet On his first jump he became the first man to legally pass the 18 metre barrier That record lasted for about 20 minutes His second jump of 1829 m made him the first to jump 60 feet During his commentary for the 2008 Summer Olympics Edwards said that during the 1995 World Championships he felt as if he could jump as far as he needed to Later the same year Edwards became the BBC Sports Personality of the Year

During 1996 Edwards went into the Olympic games as favourite and world record holder But it was American Kenny Harrison who took the gold with a jump of 1809 m Edwards walked away with the silver after a leap of 1788 m Edwards won the gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games He was awarded the CBE shortly afterwards He also won golds at the 2001 World Championships and 2002 Commonwealth Games At one point in 2002 Edwards held all the gold medals for the four majors He retired after the 2003 World Championships as Great Britains most successful medal winning athlete

Edwards lives with his wife Alison in Gosforth Newcastle upon Tyne He has two sons Nathan and Sam

He initially refused to compete on Sundays due to his devout Christian beliefs This decision cost him a chance to compete in the 1991 World Championships However in 1993 after much thinking and discussion with his father he changed his mind He decided that God gave him his talent in order for him to compete in athletics 

On 2 February 2007 it was widely reported that Edwards had lost his faith in God despite him once saying My relationship with Jesus and God is fundamental to everything I do I have made a commitment and dedication in that relationship to serve God in every area of my life

The Daily Mail described Edwards as a man deeply troubled by the collapse of his Christian faith It also revealed that a friend said Edwards has a deep theological comprehension of the Bible making his spiritual meltdown even more unlikely They still go to church as a family The Daily Mail article also quoted Edwards as saying that he is going through a difficult period in his life A period that is deeply personal to him and his family such that he does not wish to comment on

Edwards presented episodes of the Christian praise show Songs of Praise until 2007

In an interview in The Times on 27 June 2007 Edwards said If there is no God does that mean that life has no purpose Does it mean that personal existence ends at death They are thoughts that do my head in One thing that I can say however is that even if I am unable to discover some fundamental purpose to life this will not give me a reason to return to Christianity Just because something is unpalatable does not mean that it is not true Furthermore in the interview with The Times he also stated When you think about it rationally it does seem incredibly improbable that there is a God In the same interview he also said I feel internally happier than at any time of my life Edwards confirmed his rejection of Christianity in an interview on BBC Five Live Sportsweek on 29 July 2007

B of the Bang was a sculpture in Manchester England located next to the City of Manchester Stadium at Sportcity The work was designed by Thomas Heatherwick It was taken apart in 2009 due to structural problems

Commissioned to mark the 2002 Commonwealth Games it was one of the tallest structures in the City of Manchester It was the tallest sculpture in the UK until the completion of Aspire in 2008 It was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the Leaning Tower of Pisa The sculpture took its name from a quotation of British sprinter Linford Christie In the quotation he said that he started his races not at the bang of the starting pistol but at The B of the Bang

The sculpture was commissioned in 2003 Construction went longer than planned and the official unveiling was delayed until 12 January 2005 Six days before the launch the sculpture suffered the first of three visible structural problems The tip of one of the spikes came off and fell to the ground Legal action started a year later resulting in an out of court settlement totalling 17m

In February 2009 Manchester City Council announced that the sculpture would be taken apart and placed in storage as the only practical alternative The council said it was committed to working closely with the design team in order to determine whether there is a robust and affordable strategy for the re construction of the structure on the site Despite the promise of storage and potential reassembly the core and legs of the sculpture were cut apart during removal

B of the Bang originally stood convert56mft0 tall It had 180 hollow tapered steel columns or spikes coming out of a central core It was angled at 30 degrees and supported by five convert25mftabbron long tapered steel legs These connected to the spikes convert22mftabbron above the ground The sculpture weighed 165 tonnes The concrete in the foundations weighed over 1000 tonnes including a convert400m2sqftabbron reinforced concrete slab The foundations are convert20mftabbron deep

The sculpture was made from the same weathering steel as the Angel of the North sculpture This slowly develops a tightly adhering oxide layer as it is exposed to the elements This layer prevents further corrosion by reducing its permeability to water As part of the design the spikes moved slightly in the wind in order to withstand gusts over convert100mihkmhabbron At the time of construction a time capsule was placed in one of the spikes of the sculpture It contained childrens poems and paintings due to be opened around 2300 The location of the time capsule after being taken apart is currently unknown

B of the Bang was located next to the City of Manchester Stadium at Sportcity in Beswick at the corner of Alan Turing Way and Ashton New Road coordinates coord532855N21146Wtypelandmarkdisplayinlinetitle It took its name from a quotation of British sprinter Linford Christie in which he said that he started his races not merely at the bang of the starting pistol but at The B of the Bang The artwork had been nicknamed KerPlunk by the locals after the popular childrens game from the 1970s

Prior to the construction of Aspire at the University of Nottingham B of the Bang was Britains tallest sculpture It stood at twice the height of the Angel of the North Angel of the North stands at convert66ftm It was designed to look like an exploding firework It was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the Leaning Tower of Pisa It was commissioned by New East Manchester Limited to commemorate the 2002 Commonwealth Games The design was selected by a panel consisting of both local residents and art experts via a competition in 2002 The sculpture was designed by Thomas Heatherwick

The sculpture was constructed in Sheffield by Thomas Heatherwick Studio Packman Lucas Flint and Neill and Westbury Structures It was approved at the start of 2003 with the central core arriving in Manchester on the 13 June 2004 This was the largest load that could be transferred via road from the factory and required a police escort This central core was lifted into place in August 2004 after which the 180 spikes could begin being attached Early estimates had given an optimistic completion date of July 2003 which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname G of the Bang

The official unveiling by Linford Christie took place on 12 January 2005

In total the sculpture cost 142 million to design and construct twice the original estimate as the initial costing had neglected to include installation costs Funding was sourced from a European Regional Development Fund contribution of 700000 the North West Development Agency contributing 500000 and Manchester City Council providing 120000

The tip of one of the convert21mftabbron spikes detached and fell from the sculpture on the 6 January 2005 only six days before the official unveiling After inspection the event went ahead as planned

Four months later in May 2005 a second spike had to be cut off by firefighters after it was discovered hanging loose At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed As a result some of the joints were re welded with equipment put in place to prevent excessive movement This consisted of retrofitting tip weights to 170 of the spikes

Despite these modifications B of the Bang remained fenced off prompting a local newspaper campaign to Get It Sorted In May 2006 a total of nine spikes were removed from the sculpture and taken away for metallurgical analysis to discover the stresses being placed on the steel

It was announced in October 2007 that Manchester City Council were taking legal action against the makers of the sculpture with the aim of completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture In November 2008 this culminated in an out of court settlement being reached between Manchester City Council the projects designers Thomas Heatherwick Studio Ltd and the engineering and construction subcontractors Packman Lucas Ltd Flint and Neill Partnership and Westbury Structures Ltd The agreement was to pay the council 17m in damages for breach of contract and negligence

Acting on a report in January 2009 the city council recommended that B of the Bang should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe reinstatement The report recognised the sculptures aesthetic value for Manchester and Manchester City Council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a long term solution One possibility involved the replacement of the steel spikes with alternatives made from carbon fibre although the report underlined the necessity for extensive testing 

In January 2009 Antony Gormley creator of the Angel of the North to which B of the Bang is often compared spoke out in support of the sculpture stating that It is a great tribute to Manchester that this ground breaking work was commissioned To allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of the councils nerve 

Despite Gormleys plea removal of B of the Bang began in April 2009 More substantial hoarding was erected around the site and demolition firm Connell Bros Ltd began removing the spikes with oxyacetylene cutting equipment 

Although the council had earlier promised to store the complex central core and legs these too were cut apart during removal casting doubt on future prospects for the landmark sculptures return

A college degree is a type of certification or official credentials that indicates a person has completed all the college classes to earn that award The number of college courses required to graduate will vary depending on whichever college is attended

There are hundreds of different college degrees but they are often grouped into a few categories

The college courses needed for a masters degree or for a doctorate are often highly advanced difficult subjects and they would be extremely difficult to understand unless a person had already attended the undergraduate courses The reason the upper level courses are so difficult so hard to understand is that they assume the person already knows perhaps 1000 technical terms learned in earlier college courses This is similar to having to know the Latin names of all 206 bones in the human body as just part of those technical terms

There are other types of college degrees as well

Squat is a renowned element of many folk dances 

In powerlifting and bodybuilding as well as in other sports squat is an exercise that strengthening the muscles of the thighs hips and buttocks as well as the bones ligaments and insertion of the tendons throughout the lower body FileJosephine Baker 2jpgSquatting on tips as a dance exercise FileUS Navy 060627 N 5290S 097 Gilad of the Fit TV show Bodies in Motion films a show aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme RichardjpgSide split squat at a group calisthenics FileUPSTREAM FITNESS 1jpgBack squat with barbell for fitness at gym 

Although the squat is a basic element of weight training it has been the subject of considerable controversy in recent years Some trainers allege that squats are associated with injuries to the lumbar spine and knees As a result many trainers suggest that the standard barbell squat be modified in various ways Others however reject all suggestions that the exercise be abandoned continuing to advocate the squat

Lubbock was the son of Sir John Lubbock 3rd Baronet and was brought up in the family home of High Elms near Downe in Kent In 1842 his father brought home a great piece of news Young John Lubbock thought it might be a new pony and was disappointed that the news was that Charles Darwin was moving to Down House in the village He was soon a frequent visitor to Down House and became the closest of Darwins younger friends

Lubbock was educated at Eton College from 1845 and afterwards was taken into his fathers bank where he became a partner at the age of twenty two In 1865 he succeeded to the baronetcy 

In 1870 1874 and 1880 he was elected to Parliament where he promoted a number of laws Lubbock was elected the first president of the Institute of Bankers in 1879 in 1881 he was president of the British Association and from 1881 to 1886 president of the Linnean Society of London In March 1883 he founded the Bank Clerks Orphanage which in 1986 became the Bankers Benevolent Fund a charity for bank employees past and present and their dependants In January 1884 he founded the Proportional Representation Society later to become the Electoral Reform Society

Lubbock received honorary degrees from the universities of Oxford Cambridge Edinburgh Dublin and Wrzburg and in 1878 was appointed a trustee of the British Museum From 1888 to 1892 he was president of the London Chamber of Commerce from 1889 to 1890 vice chairman and from 1890 to 1892 chairman of the London County Council

In February 1890 he was appointed a Privy Councillor and was chairman of the committee of design on the new coinage in 1891 In January 1900 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Avebury his title commemorating the largest Neolithic site in Europe

In 1865 Lubbock published what was possibly the most influential archaeological text book of the 19th Century Pre historic times as illustrated by ancient remains and the manners and customs of modern savages He invented the terms Palaeolithic and Neolithic to denote the Old and New Stone Ages respectively but more notable was his introduction of a Darwinian view of human nature 

Lubbock was also an amateur biologist of some distinction writing books on hymenoptera on insect sense organs and development on the intelligence of animals and on other natural history topics He was a member of the famous X Club founded by TH Huxley to promote the growth of science in Britain He discovered that ants were sensitive to the ultraviolet range of the spectrum The Punch verse of 1882 captured him perfectly

He carried out extensive correspondence with Charles Darwin who lived nearby in Downe In addition to their shared interest in natural history both men were active advocates of spelling reform and members of the Spelling Reform Association When Darwin died in 1882 Lubbock suggested the honour of burial in Westminster Abbey and was one of the pallbearers

Georges Pierre Seurat was a French Post Impressionist painter 

Seurat painted for a time with the Impressionist painters Claude Monet Renoir Sisley and Pisarro His scientific ideas about colour then led him to develop a different painting technique He painted in tiny dots of colour with the theory that the viewers eye would mix them This technique is called pointillism 

Seurat and his followers are often referred to as the Neo Impressionists His most famous paintings are A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte in the Chicago and Bathers at Asnires in the National Gallery London

Eugne Boudin was a French painter of landscapes and seascapes He was one of the first landscape painters to paint outdoors rather than in a studio He was a great influence on the French Impressionists

Boudin was born at Trouville France and was the son of a sailor In 1835 his father opened a small shop in Le Havre where Boudin worked with him selling stationery and making picture frames Boudin met many artists who put their paintings for sale in the shop In his early twenties Boudin went to Paris to study painting He returned often to paint the seashores around his home 

In 1856 Boudin met Claude Monet who spent several months working with Boudin in his studio The two remained lifelong friends Monet later said that Boudin had been a major influence on him teaching him to paint outdoors Camille Corot who was one of the greatest influences on Monet and the other Impressionists gazed at Boudins work and said You are the master of the sky 

The Eugene Boudin Prize is an award given by the Socit Nationale des Beaux Arts of France

The Boolean satisfiability problem is a kind of problem It is from math based logic In propositional logic a formula is satisfiable if the variables it uses can be given values so that it becomes true It is important to know that for a given formula no numbers exist so that the formula becomes true In other words the formula will always be false no matter what values its variables have The formula is called satisfiable in the first case It is called unsatisfiable in the second case 

This problem is also known as Boolean or propositional satisfiability Computer scientists usually call it SAT Complexity theory believes that the formula should be in a special form known as conjunctive normal form A formula that is in this form has clauses Formulae are joined by a logical and Each clause has several literals They are joined by a logical or A literal and its complement cannot appear in the same clause The problem may also have other names The names depend on what the logical formula looks like The names also depend on how many variables are used per clause

A formula that satisfies 3SAT looks like the following

In this case is an example for a clause and B1 is one of the literals of this clause

At the beginning of the 1970s Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin showed that the problem is NP complete This is known as the CookLevin theorem 

The problem 3SAT uses three variables per clause It is one of the 21 NP complete problems They were defined by Richard Karp in 1972

Denver Clayton Lemaster was a Major League Baseball pitcher He began his career when he was signed by the Milwaukee Braves He spent 1958 early 1962 in the minors He joined the Braves in 1962 and pitched his first game on June 15th He played with the Braves until 1967 They had moved to Atlanta by that time After the 1967 season he was traded to the Astros with Denis Menke The Braves were given Sonny Jackson and Chuck Harrison Lemaster played with the Astros for four years He was then sold to the Montreal Expos but was released halfway through the season

In complexity theory NP complete is a complexity class for problems which have two basic properties

A solution to such a problem can be verified quickly but finding such a solution is very difficult NP complete problems can be characterised by the fact that no fast solution to them is known Very often the time or effort required to solve such a problem grows with the size of the problem As a result such problems can be solved if they are small As an example the Travelling salesman problem is one of the problems that is NP complete As of 2010 it can be solved for routes of up to about hundred cities Solving it for more cities will take too long 

The question whether these problems can be solved quickly is one of the most important of theoretical computer science This question is generally known as P versus NP 

Many of the problems encountered in computer science are NP complete Good programmers should be able to recognise that a problem is NP complete While solving such a problem exactly may take too long it is often possible to find good approximation algorithms Such algorithms will only solve a very specific case or they may not work in certain cases but they may provide a solution for the problem at hand that works most of the time 

In 1972 Richard Karp published an article called Reducibility among combinatorial problems in which he showed that 21 diverse combinatorial and graph theoretical problems are NP complete Each of these problems was known for its difficulty 

In the article he showed that each of these problems can be changed to a different problem which is known to be NP complete The new problem must therefore also be NP complete 

The CookLevin theorem is a theorem from theoretical computer science which says that the Boolean satisfiability problem is NP complete Any problem that is in NP can be changed so that to the Boolean satisfiability theorem On a deterministic Turing machine this takes polynomial time An important consequence of the theorem is that if there exists a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for solving Boolean satisfiability then there exists a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for solving all problems in NP The same follows for any NP complete problem 

The question of whether such an algorithm exists is called the P versus NP problem and it is widely considered the most important unsolved problem in theoretical computer science The theorem is named after Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin

Gnathostomulids or jaw worms are a small phylum of marine invertebrates which were discovered in 1956 They are tiny worm like marine animals They inhabit sand and mud beneath shallow coastal waters and can survive in relatively anoxic environments 

Most gnathostomulids measure 05 to 1 millimetre in length They are slender to thread like worms with a transparent body The neck region is slightly narrower than the rest of the body giving them a distinct head 

Like flatworms they have a ciliated epidermis but are unique in having but one cilium per cell The cilia allow the worms to glide along in the water between sand grains although they also have muscles that allow the body to twist or contract 

They have no circulatory or respiratory system The nervous system is very simple and restricted to the outer layers of the body wall The only sense organs are modified cilia which are especially common in the head region

The mouth is just behind the head on the underside of the body It has a pair of muscular jaws supplied with minute teeth and a plate on the lower surface that bears a comb like structure which they use to scrape smaller organisms off of the grains of sand that make up their anoxic seabed mud habitat The mouth opens into a blind ending tube in which digestion takes places there is no anus 

There are approximately 100 described species and certainly many more as yet undescribed Gnathostomulids have no fossil record

Gnathostomulids are simultaneous hermaphrodites Each individual possesses a single ovary and one or two testes After fertilisation the single egg ruptures through the body wall and adheres to nearby sand particles the parent is able to rapidly heal the resulting wound The egg hatches into a miniature version of the adult without a larval stage

Anoxia means there is no oxygen Anoxic is used in biology to refer to habitats with little or no oxygen A related term is hypoxia which means low oxygen

Anaerobic usually means the same thing an anaerobic organism is one which does not need oxygen

2010 Pacific hurricane season started on May 15 2010 and will end on November 30 2010 These dates are when a storm is likely to start in 2010 The first storm of this season formed about two weeks before the first storm of 2009 did So far there have been five tropical depression four of those five became a tropical storm while only one because a hurricane In addition one storm Hurricane Celia became a major hurricane which is category 3 or greater

The first storm Tropical Storm Agatha killed at least 196 people in Central America No other storms in the 2010 Pacific hurricane season have affected land yet 

The first storm of the season started from a tropical disturbance which is similar to a tropical wave This tropical disturbance grew into Tropical Depression One E on May 29  Tropical Depression One quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and it was given the name Agatha Moving toward land Tropical Storm Agatha peak as a weak tropical storm with winds of 45 mph Tropical Storm Agatha had made landfall near the Mexico and Guatemala border Agatha had quickly died over land on May 30 after moving northward 

Tropical Storm Agatha killed about 146 people in Central America 

Tropical Depression Two E started on June 16 from a tropical wave Moving just south of the Mexican coast winds top at 30 mph which was too low for a storm to be a tropical storm Remaining off the coast Tropical Depression Two E dissipated on June 17 without becoming a tropical storm

Rains from Tropical Depression Two E caused flooding which damage about 82 houses and affected 40 other houses near the coast In addition some people lost there roofs because of high winds No people were killed by Tropical Depression Two E 

On June 17 Tropical Depression Four E started from an area of low pressure Tropical Depression Four E strengthened fast and had become Tropical Storm Blas just one hour later Blas became a strong tropical storm and had its highest winds at 65 mph on June 19 It began to weakened slowly as it headed into colder waters The next day Blas weakened to a tropical depression and died the following day June 21 Tropical Storm Blas remained far enough from land to cause no affects 

Celia formed from an area of low pressure on June 19 and quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and then a hurricane On June 21 Celia became a Category 2 hurricane and on June 23 strengthened further to become a Category 3 for a little while before weakening again due to bad conditions After these bad conditions disappeared Celia strengthened again and became a Category 5 hurricane on June 24 and the strongest storm of the season so far However Celia moved into a part of the ocean with dry air above it and Celia weakened to a tropical storm quickly before dying out completely Celia was far enough away from land to not cause any damage

Simpler animals like flatworms can regenerate because the adults retain clusters of stem cells in their bodies These can migrate to damaged parts of the body then divide and differentiate to provide the missing tissue

Obsessivecompulsive personality disorder is a personality disorder People with OCPD are broken wikt linkobsessedobsessed with rules and order and can feel worried or angry when things do not seem right This can lead to routines and rules for ways of doing things for themselves and the people around them

People with OCPD pay an unusual amount of attention to details rules lists order organization and schedules It is very hard to get them to change their minds They are perfectionist and want themselves to always be working and doing it right Because of this they are afraid to let other people do things in case they do it wrong

Some people with OCPD but not all of them have a strong need to be clean Those that do not show this tendency are sometimes good at setting up systems to keep clean but may not follow through with the need to clean because of other more important things For example the need to finish a project at work might cause the OCPD person to have a quite unorganized home But if that same person was suddenly unemployed or finished with other things they could very well start becoming more concerned about being clean as they have more free time

OCPD people sometimes do not finish things on time because too much time is used in getting it to be just right Friends and family are often under serious strain because the OCPD individual must be in charge and the only one who knows what is right Not being clean or tidy enough is seen by some OCPD individuals as not being perfect enough They may regularly spend a lot of time putting things in exactly the right place in exactly the right way OCPD sufferers can be worried about things going wrong in their lives and hoard money just in case

For a person with fully developed OCPD actions and beliefs are either completely right or completely wrong and they are always right Because of this interpersonal relationships are difficult as the person demands too much of their friends partners and children When people do not do what they want sometimes people with OCPD turn to anger and even violence They often suffer from depression This can sometimes be so serious that they may commit suicide One study suggests that disorders like OCPD can make people more depressed than actually having clinical depression

People with OCPD when anxious or excited may have tics pull faces or make noises like people with Tourette syndrome or do broken wikt linkimpulsiveimpulsive and surprising things

Hypertrophy is the increase in the volume of an organ or tissue due to the enlargement of its component cells It should be distinguished from hyperplasia in which the cells remain approximately the same size but increase in number Although hypertrophy and hyperplasia are two distinct processes they frequently occur together such as in the case of the hormonally induced proliferation and enlargement of the cells of the uterus during pregnancy

One of the two most common and visible forms of organ hypertrophy occurs in skeletal muscles in response to strength training or bodybuilding

A Spiritual successor sometimes called a Spiritual sequel or a Companion piece is a sequel to a work of fiction which does not have the same storyline made in the first Spiritual successors still have the same elements themes and styles as the first

The nature of the publishermaker system are basic in almost all computer games As well as the purchase and takeovers by many companies These are reasons why creative teams often lose to keep the copyright and trademark rights of what they made This often makes attempts to make sequels for a product not possible for many reasons One of the reasons it the core of the studio being fired or taken over after finishing a project while the parent company keeps control of the copyrights and trademarks A good example of this strategy is Electronic Arts They have closed many studios while keeping their copyrights and trademarks such as Bullfrog Productions Origin Systems and Westwood Studios

To get around this creative teams will make a product that is kind of like the first game in some way without copying the first directly For example the video games TimeSplitters and Perfect Dark are often thought to be the spiritual successors to the hit video game GoldenEye 007

Other times a spiritual successor is made when the first products were either poor commercial sellers andor forgotten by the people that would purchase the product By leaving the first products name and maybe its baggage as a forgotten product the spiritual sequel can be loved by fresh eyes An example of this would be BioShock which has been named to by its makers as the spiritual successor to System Shock 2 System Shock and System Shock 2 both got good reviews but both failed to get the expected commercial success Unlike BioShock which was both a reviewer and commercial success

The history of Easter Island is rich and controversial Its inhabitants have suffered famines civil war slave raids and near total loss of forests The population has declined steeply more than once The islanders have left a cultural legacy that has famous 300400 CE was thought to be the date of the first settlement of Easter Island which is about the same time as the arrival of the first settlers on Hawaii However new results in radiocarbon dating have changed almost all of the early settlement dates in Polynesia and Rapa Nui is now considered to have been settled between 700 to 1100 CE Oral tradition says that the first settlement was in Anakena The island was most probably settled by Polynesians who navigated in canoes or catamarans from the Marquesas Islands 3200 km away or the Gambier Islands Mangareva 2600 km away When Captain Cook visited the island one of his crew members who was a Polynesian from Bora Bora was able to communicate with the Rapa Nui The language most similar to Rapa Nui is Mangarevan with about 80 of similar words In 1999 they reached Easter Island from Mangareva in 19 days According to oral traditions written down by missionaries in the 1860s the island originally had a very clear class system with an ariki high chief who had great power over nine other clans and their chiefs The high chief was the eldest descendent through firstborn lines of the islands legendary founder Hotu Matua The most visible part of the culture was the making of very large statues called moai that represented deified ancestors It was believed that the living had a relationship with the dead where the dead provided everything the living needed and the living through offerings could provide the dead with a better place in the spirit world Most settlements were located on the coast and moai were erected all along the coastline watching over their descendants in the settlements before them with their backs toward the spirit world in the sea

A constable is a person doing a certain job most commonly in law enforcement The work and role of a constable can vary a lot in different countries

Historically the word constable comes from the Latin comes stabuli count of the stables It came from the Eastern Roman Empire Originally the constable was the person who kept the horses of a lord or monarch The title was later used in the monarchies of medieval Europe In many countries the constable became a high military rank and great officer of State such as the Constable of France

In modern times constables are law enforcement officers In the United Kingdom Commonwealth of Nations and some European countries a constable is the lowest rank of police officer In the United States a constable is usually an elected peace officer with less powers than a sheriff However in the Channel Islands a constable is an elected office holder at the parish level

Historically a constable could also be someone in charge of the defence of a castle Even today there is a Constable of the Tower of London

It is a similar position to Marshal which comes from Old High German marah horse and schalh servant and originally meant stable keeper which has a similar etymology



Monaro is the name of a region in the south of New South Wales Australia A small area of Victoria near Snowy River National Park is also part of the Monaro The Australian Capital Territory is often considered part of the region most towns have very close links with Canberra

The Monaro region is a plateau area about convert1000mft0lkonabbron above sea level It lies between the valley of the Murrumbidgee River in the north and the Errinundra Plateau in the south It drops steeply to the coast on its eastern side Much of the region is an ancient highland but there is basaltic bedrock near Cooma and Nimmitabel This produces the only true chernozems in Australia These are some of the best soils in in the whole country Elsewhere the granitic soils are very infertile supporting a dry forest vegetation before clearing for pastures

Because it is located east of the Snowy Mountains the rain bearing westerly winds drop rain and snow on the mountains leaving the Monaro region in a rain shadow Annual rainfall ranges from 430 millimeters around Dalgety to 700 millimetres at the eastern edge of the plateau Occasional storms can produce very heavy rainfall In one day in June 1975 Nimmitabel received 256 millimetres of rain Temperatures in summer are warm to very warm The average maximum temperatures range from 28 C around Canberra and Queanbeyan to 22 C on the highest parts of the plateau Nights in summer can be cool but in winter the region is the coldest part of mainland Australia outside the Alps with July minima averaging 03 C in Canberra and 15 C in Bombala

The Monaro region features rolling hills that rise to very rugged peaks in the Tinderry Mountains There are shallow valleys in the upper Murrumbidgee The basaltic Monaro Range separates the Snowy and Murrumbidgee drainages Because the climate in the basaltic areas is too cold for crops the main industry is raising sheep and beef cattle

The Monaro Highway is the main State highway from Canberra to the Monaro region The main towns in the region are Cooma and Bombala others include Berridale Adaminaby Delegate Dalgety Nimmitabel and Jindabyne

A landlord is a kind of businessperson or company who owns buildings or land and earns money by charging rent to people who want to use them The word originated in the Middle Ages because a person who owned land then was also its lord who was in charge of the local government Many natural persons who are landlords use borrowed money to buy their real estate and depend on enough tenants paying their rent on time more for the purpose of reducing the amount of money they owe on the property than to provide them with an income

Donald Trump is an example of a well known modern landlord

This has been discussed before but I have two separate suggestions

I think part of the reason we get so little traffic is that if youre looking at the languages youre not going to specifically look under S for Simple English It is not a language that intuitively exists in its alphabetical order it would be more logical to subgroup it just under English S is too far down the alphabet for people to stumble across the interwiki link by browsing the bar

There are templates linking to Wikibooks and Commons stating that there is related material on the other project

It will not be long before Vector comes to Simple English Wikipedia I find Vector to be very cumbersome to use too much work to fix and hard to edit with If it is possible for Monobook to be kept as default would the community be willing to keep Monobook Wikinews put their default as Vector several months ago so I assume requests are considered On a side note Hebrew Wikipedia has already conducted a straw poll and a majority of their users have agreed to keep Monobook Being unique is good as it makes us memorable Griffinofwales 1152 13 May 2010

I would also prefer monobook to be kept as default Maximillion Pegasus 1223 14 May 2010

Personally I havent made up my mind I like Monobook but have been working on trying to use vector as much as possible Is it perfect No of course it isnt but having seen a lot of the studies that they did and having talked to a lot of the staff members that did them I think there is quite a lot of evidence to show that vector has proven to be easier to understand for new users and readers The new features that are being rolled out at the same time also make it easier to contribute and many of them do not work on monobook I think it would be a large mistake to stop the rollout here in the end we would be trading our own temporary comfort for something designed specifically to make it easier for the new readers and editors that we need People always hate change when we are comfortable with what we had and we will easily be able to move back to monobook individually after the rollout James 1815 14 May 2010

Have we totally given up on basic English grammar When I see there are 173 references to trade unions I feel a mixture of fury and despair Here goes in English nouns take plural forms but adjectives do not So we say White swans The same applies for those cases where the noun comes first and the adjectives after such as trades union because trade is a noun and union an adjective If union is used on its own as a substitute for the full term then it is being used as a noun and so takes a plural Then unions is correct Perhaps I should add that in labor union the US version labor does not take a plural because it is a collective noun En passant I notice the page Noun mistakes plural for collective Collective nouns may only be used for groups

I suspect that were we to have a purge on grammar we would find hundreds of cases of clearly mistaken grammar Macdonald ross 1755 27 May 2010

Now Ill have to agree that its not so obvious that union is an adjective It was introduced from French to middle English as an adjective but it does seem to operate in the phrase as a substantive However the formal plural is quite clear it is Trades union Refs Concise Oxford Dictionary Shorter OED vol II Fowlers Modern English Usage p658 And also trades unionism trades unionist We are so used to the normal adjective first formation that we tend to add the plural to the second word in the rarer noun first constructions WP should always give weight to formal spelling and acknowledge alternate usage if sufficiently frequent Macdonald ross 0923 28 May 2010

Public health is the science dealing with prevention of a disease that is a threat to the overall health of a community as well as with prolonging life and promoting health The aims are achieved through the organized efforts and informed choices of society public and private organizations communities and individuals 

It bases on health analysis of a handful of people or all the inhabitants of several continents rather than on an individual Public health includes such parts as epidemiology biostatistics health services environmental social behavioral and occupational health 

Public health intervention prevents rather than treats a disease through surveillance of cases and promotes healthy behaviors such as hand washing vaccination programs and distribution of condoms In outbreaks of an infectious disease treating a disease may be vital to preventing it in others 

Most countries have their own government public health agencies sometimes known as ministries of health to respond to domestic health issues Many diseases are preventable through simple non medical methods Public health plays an important role in disease prevention efforts in the developing world and in developed countries through local health systems and through international non governmental organizations In the developing world there may not be enough trained health workers or monetary resources to provide a basic level of medical care and disease prevention 

Public health has roots in antiquity From the beginning human civilization recognized that polluted water and lack of proper waste disposal spread communicable diseases Early religions attempted to regulate behavior related to health from types of food eaten to behaviors such as drinking alcohol or sexual relations Governments placed responsibility on leaders to develop public health policies and programs in order to gain some understanding of the causes of disease ensure social stability prosperity and maintain order 

The Chinese developed the practice of variolation following a smallpox epidemic around 1000 BC The practice of vaccination did not become prevalent until the 1820s During the 14th century Black Death in Europe burning parts of cities resulted in benefit since it destroyed the rodent infestations The development of quarantine in the medieval period restricted effects of other infectious diseases 

Later they started build of sewers the regular collection of garbage incineration or disposal providing clean water and draining standing water to prevent the breeding of mosquitos The industrial revolution initially caused the spread of disease through large conurbations around workhouses and factories 

The increase in average life span in the 20th century is credited to public health achievements such as vaccination programs and control of infectious diseases effective safety policies of motor vehicle and occupational safety improved family planning chlorination of drinking water smoke free measures and programs on decreasing chronic disease such as cancer heart disease and more physical exercise

Sometimes the developing world is plagued by largely preventable infectious diseases due to malnutrition and poverty The focus of public health has moved from individual behaviors and risk factors to population level issues such as inequality poverty and education There is recognition that our health is affected by where we live genetics our income our educational status and our social relationships 

Schools of public health offer 

Most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease disability and the effects of aging although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine In recent years public health programs providing vaccinations have made strides in promoting health including the eradication of smallpox 

An important public health issues facing the world currently are HIVAIDS antibiotic resistance leading to the re emergence of diseases such as Tuberculosis diabetes As non communicable diseases caused by smoking have been threatening public health public health started controlling smoking The global health system needs to find a way to even out communicable and non communicable diseases Many nations have implemented major initiatives to cut smoking such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places

Epidemiology is the study of factors which affect the health and illness of populations by communicable and non communicable diseases The study is the foundation and logic of interventions made in the interest of public health and preventive medicine It also is an important methodology of public health research and an evidence based medicine for identifying risk factors for disease and determining optimal treatment approaches to clinical practice 

Epidemiologists work from outbreak investigation to study design data collection and analysis including the development of statistical models to test hypotheses and the documentation of results Epidemiologists also study the interaction of diseases in a population Epidemiologists rely on biology biostatistics Geographic Information Science and social science disciplines

Epidemiology means the study of what is upon the people The word derived from the Greek terms epi upon among demos people district logos study word discourse It applies only to human populations But the term is used in studies of zoological populations although there is the term epizoology and it has also been applied to studies of plant populations

Hippocrates is viewed as the father of epidemiology as the first who has examined the relationships between the occurrence of disease and environmental influences He has also drawn the distinction between epidemic and endemic to distinguish between diseases that are visited upon a population from those that reside within a population The Persian physician Avicenna considered a father of modern medicine In 1020s he discovered the contagious nature of tuberculosis and sexually transmitted disease and the distribution of disease through water and soil Avicenna stated that bodily secretion is contaminated by foul foreign earthly bodies before being infected He introduced the method of quarantine as a means of limiting the spread of contagious disease 

When the Black Death reached Al Andalus in the 14th century Ibn Khatima hypothesized that infectious diseases are caused by minute bodies which enter the human body and cause disease Another Andalusian Arabian physician Ibn al Khatib in his treatise On the Plague stated how infectious disease can be transmitted through bodily contact and through garments vessels and earrings Italian doctor from Verona named Girolamo Fracastoro was the first to propose a theory that these very small unseeable particles that cause disease were alive They were considered to be able to spread by air multiply by themselves and to be destroyable by fire He refuted Galens miasma theory In 1543 he in his book De contagione et contagiosis morbis was the first to promote personal and environmental hygiene to prevent disease The development of a sufficiently powerful microscope by Anton van Leeuwenhoek in 1675 provided visual evidence of living particles consistent with a germ theory of disease

In 1662 John Graunt used analysis of the mortality rolls in London before the Great Plague to provide statistical evidence for many theories on disease and refute widespread ideas on them Dr John Snow investigated into the causes of the 19th Century Cholera epidemics He noticed the significantly higher death rates in two areas supplied by Southwark Company His identification of the Broad Street pump as the cause of the Soho epidemic is the classic example of epidemiology He used chlorine in an attempt to clean the water and had the handle removed thus ending the outbreak This has been perceived as a major event in the history of public health and can be regarded as the founding event of the science of epidemiology

The term epidemiology has first been used to describe the study of epidemics in 1802 by the Spanish physician Villalba The term has expanded considerably in scope since to cover the description and causation of not only epidemic disease but of disease in general and even many non disease health related conditions such as high blood pressure and obesity

In 1847 Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis brought down infant mortality at a Vienna hospital by instituting a disinfection procedure Unfortunately disinfection did not become widely practiced until British surgeon Joseph Lister discovered antiseptics in 1865 in light of the work of Louis Pasteur In the early 20th century mathematical methods were introduced into epidemiology by Ronald Ross and others In 1954 there was a publication of the results of a British Doctors Study led by Richard Doll which lent very strong statistical support to the suspicion that tobacco smoking was linked to lung cancer

Many epidemiologists are physicians or hold graduate degrees of Master of Public Health Master of Science or Epidemiology Doctorates include the Doctor of Public Health Doctor of Pharmacy Doctor of Philosophy Doctor of Science or for clinically trained physicians Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Veterinary Medicine As public healthhealth protection practitioners epidemiologists work in a number of different settings Some epidemiologists work in the community commonly in a public healthhealth protection service and are at the forefront of investigating and combating disease outbreaks Others work for non profit organizations universities hospitals and larger government entities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the Health Protection Agency The World Health Organisation

Epidemiology isnt a collection of statistical tools used to elucidate the associations of exposures to health outcomes but discovers causal relationships Epidemiologists employ a range of study designs from the observational to experimental and generally categorized as descriptive analytic and experimental Epidemiological studies are aimed where possible at revealing unbiased relationships between exposures such as alcohol or smoking biological agents stress or chemicals to mortality or morbidity The identification of causal relationships between these exposures and outcomes is an important aspect of epidemiology Epidemiologists use informatics as a tool The term epidemiologic triad means the intersection of Host Agent and Environment in analyzing an outbreak Epidemiologists use the key term inference and gather data a broad range of biomedical and psychosocial theories biology sociology mathematics statistics anthropology psychology and policy in an iterative way to generate or expand theory to test hypotheses and to make educated informed assertions about which relationships are causal and about exactly how they are causal Since 1965 they use Bradford Hill criteria for assessing evidence of causation

Epidemiological studies can only go to prove that an agent could have caused disease in population but not that it did cause an effect in any particular case Epidemiology has its limits at the point where an inference is made that the relationship between an agent and a disease is causal and where the magnitude of excess risk attributed to the agent has been determined that is epidemiology addresses whether an agent can cause a disease not whether an agent did cause a specific plaintiffs disease As a public health discipline epidemiologic evidence is often used to advocate both personal measures like diet change and corporate measures like removal of junk food advertising with study findings disseminated to the general public in order to help people to make informed decisions about their health Often the uncertainties about these findings are not communicated well news articles often prominently report the latest result of one study with little mention of its limitations or context Epidemiological tools have proved effective in establishing major causes of diseases like cholera and lung cancer but have had problems with more subtle health issues and several recent epidemiological results on medical treatments have been refuted by later randomized controlled trials 

Epidemiological practice and the results of epidemiological analysis make a significant contribution to emerging population based health management frameworks

Modern population based health management is complex requiring a multiple set of skills of which epidemiological practice and analysis is a core component that is unified with management science to provide efficient and effective health care and health guidance to a population This task requires the forward looking ability of modern risk management approaches that transform health risk factors incidence prevalence and mortality statistics into management metrics that not only guide how a health system responds to current population health issues but also how a health system can be managed to better respond to future potential population health issues

Case series may refer to the qualititative study of the experience of a single patient or small group of patients with a similar diagnosis or to a statistical technique comparing periods during which patients are exposed to some factor with the potential to produce illness with periods when they are unexposed

Cohort studies select subjects based on their exposure status The study subjects should be at risk of the outcome under investigation at the beginning of the cohort study this usually means that they should be disease free when the cohort study starts The cohort is followed through time to assess their later outcome status

A pooper scooper or poop scoop is a device or a poop bag used by pet owners to pick up an animals fecal matter from public places and yards Such devices often have a bag or bag attachment The poop bag is usually turned inside out to carry the feces to a proper disposal area The person performing the cleanup might also be called as a pooper scooper

A number of places including New York City have laws telling pet owners to clean up after their pets after the pet has pooped on a sidewalk or any public place on a floor wall stairway or roof of any public or private premises used in common by the public or on a fence wall or stairway of a building abutting on a public Authorized employees of New York City Departments of Health of Sanitation or of Parks and Recreation can issue tickets 

Pet droppings contaminate the environment with bacteria parasites and stench The droppings are one of the leading sources of E coli bacterial pollution one gram of dog feces contains over 20000000 E coli cells Coliform bacteria and E coli are commonly used field indicators of fecal contamination by animals While an individual animals deposit of feces will not measurably affect the environment the cumulative effect of thousands of dogs and cats in a metropolitan area creates serious problems due to contamination of soil and water supplies The runoff from neglected pet waste contaminates water creates health hazards for people fish ducks etc

The situation is particularly dire in Germany where an estimated 1400 tonnes of feces are deposited daily on public property A citizen commission overwhelmingly recommended a plan DNA samples would be required when pet licenses come up for renewal Within a year a database of some 12500 registration required canine residents would be available to sanitation workers with sample test kits Evidence would be submitted to a forensics laboratory where technicians could readily match the waste to its dog The prospect of a prompt fine equivalent to 600 US would help assure preventive compliance as well as cover costs

The heterokonts or stramenopiles are a major line of eukaryotes with more than 100000 known species most of them diatoms 

Heterokonts are mostly algae and they have two unequal flagella They include both single celled types and brown algae They are members of the Kingdom Chromalveolata

Metastability has slightly different meanings in different fields of knowledge The general idea however is that something is metastable if it is not changing yet given a small perturbation it will transition to another more stable state 

For example a block is sitting on a slope It keeps sitting there until it is nudged or the slope is gently struck setting up vibrations Then the block starts to slide At that point it keeps sliding until it reaches the bottom The block sitting at the bottom is stable The block sitting on the slope but not moving is metastable And the block as it is moving is unstable A real life example of this is an avalanche of snow The avalanche is unstable When the avalanche is over the snow is stable Before the avalanche starts the snow is metastable since some small perturbation is enough to cause it to lose what might have seemed to be stability but in fact was only metastability

They are common in freshwater and also occur in marine and brackish habitats Each cell is around 10 50 m in size and flattened in shape with an anterior groove or pocket At the edge of the pocket there are typically two slightly unequal flagella

Some may exhibit mixotrophy using mixed sources of energy

Theme restaurants are restaurants in which the idea for the restaurant takes priority over everything else It influences the architecture food music and overall feel of the restaurant The food usually takes a backseat to the presentation of the theme These restaurants generally attract customers only because of the theme itself

One example is the Rainforest Cafe restaurants which have the obvious theme of a Tropical Rainforest Medieval Times has its theme of Medieval Europe The Jekyll Hyde Club has an atmosphere of Jack the Ripper and Victorian horror novels One strange but famous theme restaurant in Berlin Germany is called das Klo It shows the insides of a toilet

Many people consider the Rainforest Cafe to be biggest example of a theme restaurant They also consider it the restaurant which kicked off the theme restaurant trend Theme restaurants may be experiencing a decline in popularity given the closings of several Planet Hollywood Jekyll Hyde Club and Wilderness Cafe locations in recent years Theme restaurants often depend on tourist business since the theme soon becomes stale to locals The focus is not necessarily placed on good food and service Certain tourist destinations such as the Mall of America or Orlando Florida have better chances of supporting theme restaurants Theme restaurants are generally common at theme parks such as Universal Studios

John Laing plc is a British developer and operator of privately financed public sector infrastructure projects such as roads railways hospitals and schools Before being bought by Henderson Private Equity in December 2006 John Laing plc was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was part of the FTSE 250 Index

The business started in 1848 James Laing along with his wife Ann Graham and some employees whom they had hired built a house on a plot of land that they had bought for 30 in Cumberland The 150 proceeds from the first house financed the building of the next two houses on the same plot of land One of these houses was kept by the Laing Family to live in The family and the business later moved near Carlisle 

When James Laing died in 1882 his son John Laing took over the running of the company John began to take larger contracts but kept the business in the Carlisle area

Johns son John William Laing was working for the business before he was 20 years old and so it became John Laing and Son By 1910 John William Laing was running the business More employees were recruited and larger projects were undertaken including factory construction 

In 1920 the firm became a limited company and two years later moved its headquarters from Carlisle to a thirteen acre site at Mill Hill in north west London 

William Kirby Laing and John Maurice Laing the fifth generation of the founding family joined the company in 1950

John Laing Sons Ltd was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1952 The family and its trusts and charities held the majority of the shares John William Laing became the chairman and his sons became joint managing directors By this time the number of employees was around 10000 and every site had a quality supervisor John William Laing retired in 1957

Under William Kirby Laing and James Maurice Laing the company continued to expand They gained contracts for power stations They also worked on road construction while continuing to build houses In 1985 Martin Laing of the sixth generation of the founding family became chairman

Martin Laing determined that the company should begin to diversify Home construction in the United Kingdom Saudi Arabia Oman the United Arab Emirates Iraq Spain and California was now one of the major sources of the companys growth

As the company celebrated its 150th anniversary in 1998 it faced falling profits caused by cost overruns on the Millennium project and continuing problems within its construction division related to competition and overcapacity

In 1999 John Laing plc purchased a controlling interest in the Chiltern Rail franchise and by 2002 had structured itself into two main divisions namely Homes and Investments It underwent yet another change when Sir Martin Laing retired in early 2002 Bill Forrester took over as executive chairman For the first time in its history Laing did not have a member of the founding family at the head of the company

The business expanded rapidly in the late 1990s such that for the year ended 31 December 2001 its turnover was in excess of 1 billion Following significant losses on certain construction contracts it adopted a new policy of having the PPP PFI businesses in which it had been quite successful as core activities As a consequence it disposed of its construction division which was sold to ORourke in 2001 its property developments divisions which were sold to Kier Group and its house building arm which was sold to George Wimpey in 2002 

In December 2006 John Laing plc was acquired by the Private Equity arm of Henderson Group

Foster was born in Reddish Stockport England to a working class family He did well at school and became interested in architecture Foster was particularly interested in the works of Frank Lloyd Wright Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier

He left school at 16 and worked in the Manchester City Treasurers office Next he joined the National Service in the Royal Air Force After he was discharged in 1956 Foster attended the University of Manchesters School of Architecture and City Planning He graduated in 1961 Later Foster won the Henry Fellowship to the Yale School of Architecture where he earned his Masters degree Foster also met Richard Rogers at Yale He then travelled in America for a year He returned to the UK in 1963 Then he set up an architectural practice as Team 4 with Rogers and the sisters Georgie and Wendy Cheesman Georgie was the only one of the team that had passed her RIBA exams This allowed them to set up in practice on their own Team 4 quickly earned a reputation for high tech industrial design

After Team 4 broke up in 1967 Foster and Wendy Cheesman started Foster Associates This later became Foster and Partners From 1968 Foster worked with American architect Richard Buckminster Fuller until Fuller died in 1983 They worked on several projects that became important in the development of an environmentally sensitive approach to design This included the Samuel Beckett Theatre project

Foster Partners first important building in the UK was the Willis Faber Dumas headquarters in Ipswich from 1974 The client was a family firm insurance company which wanted to restore a sense of community to the workplace Foster created open plan office floors long before open plan became the standard In a town that did not have a lot of public facilities the roof gardens 25m swimming pool and gymnasium are good benefits for the companys 1200 employees The building is wrapped in a full height glass facade This wall follows the medieval street plan The facade shifts from opaque reflective black to a glowing backlit transparency as the sun sets

Today Foster Partners works with its engineers to use computer systems They pay attention to basic physical laws such as convection They have created efficient buildings like the Swiss Re London headquarters The walls let in air for passive cooling and then let it out as it warms and rises

In January 2007 The Sunday Times reported that Foster had called in Catalyst a corporate finance house to find buyers for Foster Partners Foster does not want to retire but wants to sell his 80 90 holding in the company valued at 300M to 500M

A louver or louvre from the French louvert the open one is a window blind or shutter with horizontal or less often vertical slats They are angled to allow light and air in They also keep out rain direct sunshine and noise The angle of the slats may be adjusted

Louvers come from the Middle Ages as lantern like constructions in wood that were fitted on top of roof holes They were put in large kitchens to allow ventilation while keeping out rain and snow They were originally rather rough constructions consisting only of a barrel Later they became more elaborate designs made of pottery They took the shape of faces where the smoke and steam from cooking would pour out through the eyes and mouth They also became more like modern louvers with slats that could be opened or closed by pulling on a string

More modern louver windows are made of slats of glass opened and closed with a metal lever They may also be shutters of wood plastic or other material

Some modern louver systems serve to improve indoor daylighting Fixed mirrored louver systems can limit glare and of redirect diffuse light Such louvers may be put in between two panes of double glazing

Louvers are rarely seen as primary design elements in the language of modern architecture They are rather simply a technical device However there are examples of architects who use them as part of the overall aesthetic effect of their buildings The most well known example is Finnish modernist architect Alvar Aalto who would create aesthetic effects in the facades of his buildings through the combination of different types and sizes of louvers Some are fixed and some are moveable They are made mostly from wood A second example taking influence from Aalto is the second generation modernist architect Juha Leivisk 

Additionally louvers are used as semi passive means of thermal control on spacecraft They are also available as an accessory for some automobiles

The sixth season followed two timelines each an outcome of the explosion of a hydrogen bomb in the previous season finale In the first timeline Oceanic Flight 815 never crashes but lands with all leaving the airplane at Los Angeles LAX airport In the second timeline the remaining survivors return to the present day and must deal with the demise of Jacob whose death has been caused by the mysterious Man in Black the Smoke Monster According to show producer Damon Lindelof the term flash sideways was deliberately used instead of alternate reality because it might then imply that one of them isnt real or one of them is real and the other is the alternate to being real

On the island it is revealed that long long ago infant Jacob and his brother were stolen from their birth mother by a woman who raised them to become protectors of the island after her At the hidden center of the island is a waterfall cave containing a bright power source Jacob and his brother grow up with opposing viewpoints Jacob stays loyal to his adoptive mother but his brother joins with outsiders on the island When the brother reveals that they have dug into the core of the island tapping an underground power to escape the mother hits the brother with a rock and she destroys the people in their village She then chooses Jacob to drink the water of immortality His brother awakens to see the burned village and seeking revenge he finds and kills his adoptive mother Jacob discovers her dead body and in turn throws his brother into the waterfall cave transforming him into the black Smoke Monster

Now centuries later among the survivors the Smoke Monster assumes the form of John Locke returned to the island in a coffin This Locke had convinced Ben to enter the seaside cave and stab Jacob who fell into the fire and died With many survivors believing that Locke has been resurrected they follow him in various plans to leave the island In one plan they overthrow the guards at Widmores submarine and leave the island unaware that a time bomb is inside the submarine Jack discovers the time bomb advising them not to disarm it while reasoning that the Smoke Monster cannot kill anyone directly Instead Sawyer refuses to listen and pulls the bomb wires which instead causes the bomb to count down faster Sayid grabs the bomb and runs through the submarine sacrificing himself to shield the others from the bomb blast However the bomb splits the submarine walls and while sinking Sun Hwa is trapped in the wreckage but Jin stays with her vowing to never leave her side again as they both perish underwater

Jack swims with a breathing tube to the surface and back to shore He tells the rest that Sun and Jin did not escape In anger Kate vows to kill John Locke for what he has done to their friends Sayyid Richard and Miles go to the other island to destroy the airplane However crossing at sea they find the pilot adrift who convinces them to repair the airplane to escape later

The spirit of Jacob asks who among them would become Protector of the island and Jack volunteers At the waterfall cave Jack drinks the water of immortality and returns to the group Jack says they must meet with Locke and Desmond to settle the dispute and kill Locke The 2 groups meet on the hilltop and just the 3 proceed toward the waterfall cave There Desmond descends on a rope into the cave but pulls a rock from the bottom which puts out the light of the power source The island begins a series of earthquake tremors to fall into the sea with rocks tumbling into the water Locke flees the area now needing to get the sailboat to the other island he has lost his immortality when the light source was put out Jack chases him to the sea cliffs to stop him from leaving and a long fight begins Locke grabs a knife and stabs Jack in the side then forces the knife up to Jacks neck Before plunging the knife a gunshot is heard Kate as promised has shot Locke in the back and Jack pushes him off the sea cliff to die on the rocks below

Jack tells them he must return to the island core as he promised Jacob to restore the light at the waterfall cave He instructs Kate to leave with Sawyer to get Claire into the airplane on the other island Kate in turmoil kisses Jack goodbye fearing it will be the last time Kate and Sawyer jump into the sea and swim to the sailboat at anchor

Hurley and Ben help Jack return to the waterfall cave They lower Jack into the cave where he revives and ties Desmond to the rope Jack then puts the missing stone back into the floor and restarts the light power source When Hurley and Ben pull the rope they find only Desmond They call below but Jack overcome by the knife wound and rushing water never answered so they take Desmond away from the area Some time later Jack awakens alone outside the cave as if lifted from the depth of the cave by an unseen force Dazed he wanders through the jungle but he is losing strength Just as with Lockes death Jack also lost his immortality and protection at the first time the light source was put out Jack falls to the ground looking up to the blue sky At that point he sees Kates plane flying far overhead and then closes his eyes for the last time

Meanwhile in the flash sideways view of events everyone has returned on Oceanic Flight 815 and all have resumed their original lives

Soon after returning on Flight 815 Desmond has been tasked to ensure that bandmember Charlie stays sober to appear at a benefit concert for Charles Widmore Charlie keeps talking about some imaginary profound romance with a blonde girl as if in some dream Trying to rebel against Desmond he grabs the steering wheel and the car goes into the harbor Underwater looking back inside the car to save Charlie he remembers seeing NOT PENNYS BOAT written on Charlies hand but not actually then pulls him to the surface They get rescued to the hospital and Desmond asks Who is Penny Some memories come back and Desmond begins to orchestrate a plan at the school he hits John Locke with his car causing him to need surgery led by Jack Shephard at the hospital Desmond turns himself in to the police station for Sawyer who puts him in a jail cell near Kate and Sayid

Meanwhile Hurley has been hired to free Kate Sayid and Desmond by paying Officer Ana Lucia to detour the prison van to the harbor They get in 2 cars and make plans to attend the benefit concert Desmond and Kate drive to the church where Desmond meets the funeral van to accept the casket of Christian Shephard into the chapel This same day John Locke has a 2nd spinal surgery by Jack and regains feeling in his legs Coming to the hospital to visit Sun Hwa the police officer Sawyer meets Juliet at the snack machines where they both suddenly remember their parallel life 3 years together on the island

Now nighttime Hurley drives Sayid to a backstreet saying that he knows he is really a good guy a fight breaks out in the alley and a girl shouts Dont hurt my brother Sayid instinctively jumps out to rescue her When he sees her face he remembers her Shannon Her stepbrother Boone goes to the van and tells Hurley he is glad Sayid finally arrived because he was getting tired of staging the alley fight for them Desmond attends the concert where Daniel Faradays mother talks to Desmond about the secret plan While performing on stage Charlie recognizes Claire in the audience as the girl of his dreams when she leaves to give birth to her son assisted by Kate to get to the hospital

Finally Kate has convinced Jack to drive to the church intended for his fathers funeral There he enters the chapel and upon touching his fathers casket he too begins to remember everything from the Island all of them including his years spent with Kate However upon opening the casket he finds it empty his father has assumed a spirit form and reminds him that he too died on the island in his other life which was as real as the present day They both enter the church where all the former islanders have gathered Sun with Jin Sawyer with Juliet Sayid with Shannon Rose with Bernard Hurley with Libby Even Desmond and Penny are together there remembering their parallel life and birth of their child Everyone who recently landed with Oceanic Flight 815 now greet and hug each other as if old friends remembering how once they all were lost but now they have found each other

A weather map is a tool It is used to show facts and study of many kinds of meteorological amounts at different levels of the atmosphere quickly They have been used from the mid 19th century Weather maps have been used both for study and for weather forecasting purposes Some maps show differences of temperature This can help find weather fronts 

People first began using weather charts in a modern way in the mid 19th century They began using them to make a theory about storm systems When a telegraph network developed by 1845 it was possible for people to collect information about the weather They could get the information from many different places far away quickly enough for the information to be useful In the 1840s Joseph Henry took charge He helped the Smithsonian Institution focus most of its observers on the center and the eastern part of the United States during the 1840s and 1860s The US Army Signal Corps kept up this network between 1870 and 1874 by an act of Congress It later expanded to the west side

At first all the data on the map was not taken from these analyses This was because there was not enough time standardization People first tried to standardize time in Great Britain in 1855 The entire United States was not influenced by time zones until 1905 This was when Detroit had made the standard time at last Over all the earth other countries began taking weather observations at the same time This started in 1873

A station model is a symbolic picture showing the weather at a reporting station Meteorologists made the station model to put down many weather elements in a small space on weather maps Maps thickly filled with station model plots can be hard to read However they help meteorologists pilots and mariners to see important weather patterns A computer draws a station model for every place of observation The station model is mostly used for surface weather maps It can also be used to show the weather in the sky though A complete station model map lets people study patterns in air pressure temperature wind cloud cover and precipitation

Chaetognatha commonly known as arrow worms are a phylum of small predatory marine animals They are present in huge numbers in plankton worldwide 

About 20 of the known species are benthic and can attach to algae or rocks They are found in all marine waters from surface tropical waters and shallow tide pools to the deep sea and polar regions Most chaetognaths are transparent and are torpedo shaped but some deep sea species are orange They range in size from convert2to120mmin 

Despite the huge numbers there are only about 120 modern species in 20 genera Some species are known to use the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin to subdue their prey

Chaetognaths appear to have originated in the Cambrian Period Complete body fossils have been described from China and the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia

Lactase is an enzyme which acts on lactose breaking it down so it can be digested 

Mammals in their infancy usually make lactase they need it for digesting the lactose found in their mothers milk Mammalian adults usually lose the capacity to produce lactase Thus if you give milk to an adult cat it causes discomfort and diarrhea

Humans are somewhat different Some humans continue to produce lactase and some do not It is a type of polymorphism

The ability to digest lactose into adulthood was useful to humans after the invention of animal husbandry This developed animals that gave a consistent supply of milk 

Hunter gatherer populations before the Neolithic revolution were overwhelmingly lactose intolerant So are modern hunter gatherers 

A mutation on chromosome 2 stops the shutdown in lactase production making it possible for those with the mutation to continue drinking fresh milk throughout their lives

This appears to be a recent adaptation to dairy consumption It has occurred independently in both northern Europe and East Africa in populations with a pastoral lifestyle Lactase persistence allowing lactose digestion to continue into adulthood is a dominant allele making lactose intolerance a recessive trait 

Genetic studies suggest that the oldest mutations associated with lactase persistence only reached appreciable levels in human populations in the last ten thousand years Therefore lactase persistence is often cited as an example of recent human evolution As lactase persistence is genetic but animal husbandry a cultural trait this is geneculture coevolution

A Regional Casino more commonly known as a Super Casino is the term given to the largest category of casino that was to have been permitted under UK law It is meant to be the same size as the larger casinos in Las Vegas The first Regional Casino was proposed to be in the City of Manchester This was stopped by the UK government soon after Gordon Brown became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom

The Gambling Act 2005 revised many regulations relating to gambling in England Amongst the most controversial provisions was the establishment of a number of destination casinos in the style of Las Vegas commonly referred to in the media as Super Casinos

Initial drafts of the act proposed eight regional casinos but concerns expressed in the national media and by a range of addiction related social and religious groups meant that the final revision of the act permitted only one casino of the largest size referred to as a Regional Casino with a further eight large and eight small casinos of a smaller sizes and with reduced Jackpot limits

Prior to the act there were 140 casinos in the UK the largest of which in Star City Birmingham had a floor area of around 950 square metres Customers were required to register twenty four hours prior to gaming

Under the terms of the Gambling Act the Secretary of State is able to define each type of Casino with reference to any matter he or she chooses although the act specifically mentions as facts to consider the number location and concentration of gaming tables and the floor area designated for a specific purpose

Definitions have been determined such that the super casino will have a minimum customer area of 5000 square metres and at most 1250 unlimited jackpot slot machines

Large casinos will have a minimum area of 1000 square metres and up to 150 slot machines with a maximum jackpot of 4000

The small casinos will have a minimum customer area of 750 sq metres up to 80 slot machines and a jackpot of 4000

In May 2006 a short list of eight sites selected from various ones submitted by local councils was announced for the location of the Regional Casino These were

On 30 January 2007 it was announced that the first Regional Casino would be built in East Manchester near the City of Manchester Stadium This was a shock to the Blackpool and The O2 bids Both of them were thought of as the favourites However the Blackpool bid organisers pledged to continue the work in getting government approval for a supercasino

Pericles Funeral Oration is a famous speech from Thucydides History of the Peloponnesian War The speech was delivered by Pericles at the end of the first year of the Peloponnesian War He was a famous Athenian politician The speech was a part of the yearly public funeral for the people who died in the war

At that time people in Athens had a custom of holding a public funeral for the people who died in war The bodies of the dead were left out for three days in a tent where offerings could be made for the dead

Funeral Oration was recorded by Thucydides in book two of his History of the Peloponnesian War Thucydides records the speech as if every word in the record was what Pericles said However people agree he did at least correct or change the speeches a little Thucydides says in his History that the speeches are not completely the same as what was really said but written to show the main ideas of what was said It is quite certain that Pericles delivered a speech at the end of the first year of the war However people are not sure how much Thucydides record is the same as Pericles actual speech

The Funeral Oration is important because the speech was different from usual Athenian funeral speeches David Cartwright describes it as a eulogy of Athens itself The speech is about what great things Athens did delivered to encourage the people

American Civil War scholar Garry Wills calls Abraham Lincolns famous Gettysburg Address the modern parallel to Pericles Funeral Oration

In Ancient Greece the Gorgoneion was originally a magic pendant showing the Gorgons head The gorgoneion was linked with the gods Zeus and Athena both are said to have worn it as a pendant It was also popular as a royal symbol worn on shields and capes These can be seen on the Alexander Mosaic and the Gonzaga Cameo

Homer wrote about the Gorgon on four occasions but only about the head as if the creature had no body Jane Ellen Harrison notes that Medusa is a head and nothing morea mask The body was added many years later Up to the 5th century BC the head was shown as being very ugly with her tongue sticking out boar tusks puffy cheeks her eyeballs staring straight ahead and the snakes twisting all around her 

The direct frontal stare was highly unusual in ancient Greek art In some cases a beard was added to her chin making her appear as a wild and sexual god like Dionysus

Gorgoneia painted on the shields of warriors on mid 5th century Greek vases are not as ugly strange or frightening By that time the Gorgon had lost her tusks and the snakes were rather stylized The Hellenistic marble known as the Medusa Rondanini shows how the Gorgon changed over time into a beautiful woman

Gorgoneia are first seen in Greek art at the beginning of the 8th century BC One of the earliest is on a coin found during an archaelogical dig at Parium Other early 8th century examples were found at Tiryns There is a similar image from the Knossos palace dating from the 15th century BC Marija Gimbutas even argues that the Gorgon extends back to at least 6000 BC as a ceramic mask from the Sesklo culture illustrates

In the 6th century BC gorgoneia of a basic type of lion mask were found all over Greek temples especially in and around Corinth Pedimental gorgoneia were common in Sicily probably the earliest one is in the Temple of Apollo in Syracuse Around 500 BC they stopped being used to decorate monumental buildings but were still shown on parts of the roof tiles of smaller buildings throughout the next century 

As well as temples the Gorgon image can be found on dress dishes weapons and coins across the Mediterranean region from Etruria to the Black Sea coast The Gorgon coins were made in 37 cities making her image on coins second only to some of the main Greek gods On mosaic floors the gorgoneion was usually near the door as if guarding it On Attic kilns a gorgoneion over the kiln door protected from accidents 

The Gorgon image remained popular even in Christian times especially in the Byzantine Empire including Kievan Rus The image was used in Western Europe by the Italian Renaissance artists In the 20th century the gorgoneion was used by Gianni Versace as a logo for his fashion company

Gimbutas says the gorgoneia are part of of the Mother Goddess cult linked to dynamic life energy She said the gorgoneion is a typical European image Jane Ellen Harrison on the other hand claims that many primitive cultures use similar ritual masks These are meant to scare the owner from doing something wrong or as she terms it to make an ugly face at him

Jean Dsir Gustave Courbet was a French painter He was the leader of the Realist movement in 19th century French painting Courbet is very important in French painting for two reasons Firstly he was prepared to try out new ideas and ways of painting Secondly his paintings made social comment on the world around him In other words he was not afraid to show real life in a way that was not always beautiful and nice 

Courbets paintings were an inspiration to many other painters particularly the French Impressionists and Post Impressionists Edouard Manet Edgar Degas Vincent van Gogh and Henri Toulouse Lautrec were all inspired by Gustave Courbets paintings of people His landscape paintings were an inspiration to Claude Monet Seurat Cezanne and many other painters 

Courbet was born in 1819 and was the son of Rgis and Sylvie Oudot Courbet in Ornans Doubs Courbets sisters Zo Zlie and Juliette were his first models for drawing and painting 

When Courbet was twenty he went to Paris in 1839 and worked at the studio of two other painters Steuben and Hesse He was not happy there and wanted to work on his own He studied the works of many great masters including Goya Velazquez and Titian He painted several self portraits at this time He often returned home to Ornans to hunt fish and find inspiration in the countryside and country life

In 18461847 Coubet travelled to the Netherlands and Belgium where he studied the paintings of Rembrandt Franz Hals and Jan Steen who all painted in the 1600s The paintings by these artists often showed realistic scenes and portraits of everyday life They showed ordinary people at the table together dancing writing cooking working at trades and in businesses and in the fields There were many pictures of soldiers Courbet decided that he wanted to paint scenes of ordinary life the way that these artists did He did not want to paint scenes from literature history or mythology like most other artists in France at that time 

Success 

Courbet painted a large picture of everday life at Ornans The painting called After Dinner at Ornans shows four men who have just finished a meal at a little table which is perhaps in an inn One man is playing his violin one man is lighting his pipe Courbet sits listening with his head leaning on his hand A large dog is curled under a chair Courbet showed the painting at the Salon Exhibition in Paris It was a great success It won a Gold Medal and was bought by the French Government Because of the gold medal Courbet could hang his pictures at the Salon Exhibitions without having them checked by a jury first Courbets work along with the work of Honor Daumier and Jean Franois Millet became known as Realism Like the Dutch painters that he admired Courbet often painted in broad rough brush strokes He often used dark earthy colours particularly brown in his paintings

Stone Breakers 

In 1849 Courbet saw two people working by the roadside using small hammers to break large rocks into gravel One was an old man and the other was a young boy Courbet painted a picture of this scene He explained it to a friend It is not often that one meets with so complete an expression of poverty and so right then and there I got the idea for a painting I told them to come to my studio the next morning 

The picture soon became one of the most famous scenes of the life of poor people that has ever been painted It was destroyed during World War II in Dresden

 A Burial at Ornans 

Courbets other important painting that was shown at the Salon of 1850 was a scene of life at his village Beginning in 1849 he painted the funeral of his great uncle who had died the previous year Courbet got all the village people who had been at the funeral to come to his studio and pose for him one by one until the painting was complete The painting was very large 10 by 22 feet The famous artist Jacques Louis David had once painted a very large picture in the same way Davids picture was of the Coronation of Napoleon and showed all the people who were present 

Some people praised The Funeral at Ornans but other people were very angry about it They thought that it was wrong to show the burial of an ordinary man in a huge painting as if he was as important as an emperor They thought that it was wrong to show the poor people of a village with their old clothes and dirty boots as if they were all as important as lords and ladies  Some of the critics said that Courbet was deliberately trying to paint ugliness Many people came to see the picture and liked the new Realist way of painting Courbet said The Burial at Ornans was the burial of Romanticism 

Courbet became a celebrity People said he was a genius a terrible socialist and a savage Courbet wrote to a friend in 1850

During the 1850s Courbet painted many other pictures using common folk and friends as his subjects such as Village Damsels the Wrestlers Bathers The Sleeping Spinner and The Wheat Sifters

Courbet then painted another huge picture This painting is called The Artists Studio and is about seven years in his life as a painter He shows himself at the centre of the picture working on a large landscape painting Behind him is an artists model who is naked All around Courbet are his friends and people from his village His mother stands to one side of the picture Another woman is sitting on the floor feeding her baby A little boy watches the artist while a white cat plays on the floor 

In 1855 Coubet took this picture with Burial at Ornan and twelve other paintings to be shown in a big international exhibition in Paris called Exposition Universelle The two biggest paintings and another one were sent away because there was not enough room Courbet was angry He had his own building put up and showed forty of his paintings Many other artists praised Courbet but some people laughed at him and the public did not buy very many of his pictures Because of what he had done younger artists heard about him and admired him These included James McNeill Whistler in the United States as well as douard Manet in France

In 1857 Courbet showed six pictures in the Salon exhibition One was a hunting scene and one was a picture of two prostitutes lying under a tree on the banks of the River Seine in Paris Many people came to see the exhibition and to buy his paintings The hunting scenes were very popular for decorating the halls and dining rooms of large houses 

For the rest of his life Courbet painted erotic pictures like the picture of the prostitutes and also many more hunting scenes His last erotic painting was called The Origin of the World and was a close up painting of female genitals This painting was not shown in a public exhibition until 1988 He also painted very many landscapes which he began by doing outdoor sketches then made into big paintings in his studio By the 1870s Courbet was thought of as one of the leading artists in France The emperor offered to make Courbet a member of the Lgion dhonneur which was the highest honour in France but Courbet refused to accept it He believed that he belonged to the poor and ordinary people not to the high and mighty

At this time there were many political problems in France Courbet became involved in the political problems In 1871 he was blamed because a public monument called the Vendme Column had been demolished He was put in prison for six months In 1873 the new government expected him to pay to have the monument restored and put back He did not have enough money so left France to live in Switzerland The government decided to make terms so that Courbet could pay for the column in yearly payments of 10000 francs for 33 years Courbet died at La Tour de Peilz Switzerland on 31 December 1877 one day before the first payment was due He was 58 and died of liver disease made worse by heavy drinking

A dispute is a continuing disagreement carried on between two or more parties The parties may be people or they may be organisations or countries Disputes can last a long time and they can have serious results Disputes may become conflicts Disputes between individual people may lead to violence Disputes between organisations may lead to legal action Disputes between countries may lead to war

Several factors make disputes more serious Serious disputes may do a lot of damage to the people involved and to their societies 

Disputes may last for long periods and the longer they last the more damage they may do Where disputes involve religions or hostile countries they may last for more than a lifetime Generations of children may be taught that their side is completely right and the other wrong 

Disputes arise when there are conflicting needs values or ideas Differences of religion and culture are a common cause of disputes Self interest is a common cause of disputes between individuals 

A second factor is the use of books newspapers radio and television by each side to promote their side of the argument This propaganda helps to continue and spread the dispute

Laws may prevent freedom of speech and prevent discussion in print or other media This makes it difficult for either side to see merit in the other point of view In turn this makes it difficult for compromise or tolerance to dissolve the dispute

The study of disputes and conflicts reached its peak during the Cold War Then the West versus East conflict seemed to threaten world peace and many ideas were put forward to use negotiation as a tool to calm the tension Negotiation about the reduction of nuclear weapons was successful

The tension was finally reduced by the unexpected end of the Soviet Union and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe This was not achieved by negotiation The reasons for the end of the Soviet Union are still being debated

 Mediation  Professional help may be available Between people there are counsellors between organisations there are specialists in conflict resolution between countries there is the United Nations 

Some disputes do fade with the passage of time though the time may be much longer than a human lifetime Conflict between religions may fade only after centuries and there is no known process of mediation

All legal systems have provisions for making decisions in disputes Usually the cases are based on claims about money between individual people or between corporate entities These are companies or other organisations Usually the law can only be used if it can reach a decision based on evidence Law textbooks list which disputes which may be addressed by law and which can not

Force has been used many times to enforce one side of the other to submit Wars have been based on disputes or disputes have been used as an excuse for wars However force has also been used to keep warring groups apart and calm people down Both the European Union and the United Nations have used peace keeping forces in areas under violent dispute

Education may be used to harden opinion and make a dispute worse or it may be used to open peoples minds to unpopular ideas Education which helps people to think for themselves and keep an open mind is thought to reduce prejudice and conflict

Democracy is one way of easing conflict within a country It is not a perfect solution for small groups may feel they are permanently excluded from power Free speech and freedom from censorship exist to some extent in democracies These freedoms are valuable to minority groups inside a country Countries that have these freedoms are called open or liberal democracies 

 Examples  Of course there are many disputes between individual people but disputes between large groups or nations are of very great importance

Point Hicks once called Cape Everard is a coastal headland on the east coast of Victoria Australia It is now a part of the Croajingolong National Park

Point Hicks is where on 19 April 1770 the continent of Australia was first sighted by the men on Captain Cooks Endeavour voyage Cook wrote that it was Lieutenant Zachary Hickes who first saw land and Cook named the point after him Hickes spelt his name with an e Cook wrote both Hicks and Hickes in different places The spelling Hicks is now in use for the point

When George Bass sailed past the area at the end of 1797 he did not locate the point It did not appear on the charts Matthew Flinders made of their voyages and the name fell into disuse

The point came to be known as Cape Everard The first use of that name is said to be by hydrographer John Lort Stokes who surveyed the coast in the Beagle in 1843 It is thought he named it after fellow naval officer John Everard Home but his maps do not use the name

The first map showing Cape Everard was by surveyor George Douglas Smythe made in 1852 and published in 1853 If he thought of the name he may have named it after William Everard commissioner of crown lands

The name Cape Everard was used until 1970 There has been doubt and arguments about exactly what Cook saw The actual latitude and longitude he gave is a location many miles out to sea

Point Hicks was renamed as part of Cooks bicentenary Victorian Premier Henry Bolte announced the new name in a ceremony at the point on 20 April 1970

A lighthouse was built on the point in 18878 and started operation in 1890 It was built from concrete and with wooden lighthouse keepers houses It was connected to mains electricity in 1965 and then to solar power recently The keepers cottages are today used as holiday houses With 37 metres of height it is the tallest lighthouse on Australias mainland Its light is a double white flash every ten seconds from a height of 56 metres above sea level

Thrace is a historical and geographic area in southeast Europe

It occupied a region bounded by the Balkan Mountains on the north Rhodope Mountains and the Aegean Sea on the south and by the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara on the east 

Thrace included areas which are now southeastern Bulgaria northeastern Greece and the European part of Turkey The Thracians were an ancient Indo European people inhabiting Central Eastern and Southeastern Europe

The indigenous population of Thrace was a people called the Thracians divided into numerous tribal groups 

Thracian troops accompanied neighboring ruler Alexander the Great when he crossed the Hellespont and took on the Persian Empire of the day 

Divided into separate tribes the Thracians did not manage to form a lasting political organization until the Odrysian state was founded in the 4th century BC Like Illyrians Thracian tribes of the mountainous regions had a warrior tradition while the tribes based in the plains were more peaceable Recent funeral mounds in Bulgaria suggest that Thracian kings did rule regions of Thrace with distinct Thracian national identity  

Thrace was conquered by Alexander and later regained its freedom It was conquered after several attempts by the Romans in 46 AD in the reign of Claudius They became a province and later four provinces of the Roman Empire Finally as the Empire crumbled Thrace suffered more than a thousand years of strife and conquest by stronger forces It never regained its independence

The Thracians did not describe themselves as such and Thrace and Thracians are simply the names given them by the Greeks

Human penis size is described by length and circumference of penis It is larger than in any other primate 

The size depends on arousal level time of day room temperature frequency of sexual activity and unreliability of the measurement methods Average measurements are applied The length is measured along the top from the base to the tip with the man standing and the penis held parallel to the floor The circumference is measured on erect penis just below the glans penis in the middle of the shaft and at the base Self measurements report a higher average length than those which used medical or scientific methods Doctors induce erection or stretch the flaccid penis as far as possible Flaccid length is not a reliable indication of erect length 

The arithmetic mean human penis is approximately convert129to15cmin in length the circumference is approximately convert123cmin There is no scientific relation between either penis size or race and shoe size or stretched penis size At birth the penis is between 24 and 55 cm long at the beginning of puberty it is 6 cm Age does not negatively correlate with penis size

Ancient Romans admired the large penis of Priapus Ancient Greek art was not obsessed with penis size A passage from Aristophanes lists broad shoulders tiny tongue strong buttocks and a little prick as the most desirable masculine features In medieval Arabic literature a longer penis was preferred but Afro Arab author Al Jahiz wrote If the length of the penis were a sign of honor then the mule would belong to the Quraysh 

Males may quite easily underestimate the size of their own penis compared to that of others because of looking down and the accumulation of fat at the base of the penis Studies found that many men who believed that their penis was of inadequate size had average sized penises Sex education of penis measurements was helpful and relieving for men who were concerned about small penis size 

An Internet survey found only 55 of participating men were satisfied with their penis size whereas 85 of participating women said they were very satisfied with the size of their partners penis and only 6 of women rated their partner as smaller than average A study concluded that penis width rather than length was a more important factor of sexual stimulation probably because a wider penis provides more friction to the clitoral area while a longer penis reaches a less sensitive area At Utrecht University was found that the majority of homosexual men regarded a large penis as ideal and having one was linked to self esteem

Widespread private concerns have led to a number of folklore sayings and popular culture reflections related to penis size There is belief that it is possible to predict the size of someones penis by observing other bodily features such as the hands feet nose or height The media has equated a mans penis size with both power and masculinity The perception of having a large penis is linked to higher self esteem

Most men concerned about their penis size and seeking surgical treatment to enlarge their penis underestimate normal penis length

Many men exaggerate the importance of deep vaginal penetration in stimulating a woman to orgasm The most sensitive area of the female genitals includes the vulva clitoris and the section of vagina closest to the outside of a womans body which is roughly 10 centimetres in length The majority of penises are likely of sufficient length to fully satisfy their partners

Some women find stimulation of the cervix by penis as uncomfortable or painful others report it to be key to orgasm The cervix may be confused with the deepest point of the vagina above and below the cervix respectively making it possible for there to be indirect andor simultaneous stimulation between them During arousal the vagina lengthens rapidly to an average of about 10 centimetres but can continue to lengthen in response to pressure The walls of the vagina are composed of soft elastic folds of mucous membrane skin which stretch or contract to the size of the penis With proper arousal the vagina stretches or contracts to accommodate virtually any size penis from small to large 

An adult penis with an erect length of less than 7 cm but otherwise formed normally is referred to as having the micropenis condition Some of the causes are deficiency of pituitary growth hormone andor gonadotropins mild degrees of androgen insensitivity a variety of genetic syndromes and variations in certain Homeobox genes Some types of micropenis can be addressed with growth hormone or testosterone treatment in early childhood

It has been suggested that penis size differences between individuals may also be caused by environmental factors such as culture diet chemicalpollution exposure etc Endocrine disruptor resulting from chemical exposure has been linked to genital deformation in both sexes Chemicals from both synthetic and natural sources in the blood of pregnant women have been linked to various degrees of endocrine disruption

Various studies have examined condom breakage which looked among other things at penis size as a factor for breakage or slippage Although the most common type of condom those made of latex have great ability to stretch they are vulnerable to dry friction as well as other mistakes of usage In a separate study of people practicing anal sex condom breakage was linked more to excessive friction than to penis sizePenis size did not influence slippage but penis circumference and broken condoms were strongly correlated with larger sizes increasing the rate of breakage

Vetus Latina is the name given to a collection of Biblical texts that were translated into Latin before the Vulgate became the standard version used in the Latin speaking world The texts themselves are written in Late Latin not in Old Latin They often use different words than the Vulgate No complete manuscript survives only fragments are known Many text passages are known because Church fathers such as Augustine of Hippo cited from them 

Since the Council of Trent held in the 16th century the Vulgate is the official Bible translation for the Roman Catholic Church 

Some of the Vetus Latin texts survives in the Liturgy however

The Old Latin text means Glory belongs to God among the high and peace belongs to men of good will on earth The Vulgate text means Glory belongs to God among the most high and peace among men of good will on earth

Probably the best known difference between the Old Latin and the Vulgate is in the Pater Noster where the phrase from the Vetus Latina quotidianum panem daily bread becomes supersubstantialem panem supersubstantial bread in the Vulgate

Historians are surveyed and asked to give them number ratings on their overall performance or on different aspects of their leadership

Several different factors are considered in deciding what makes one a good or bad president These include their character their vision for the country their relations with congress their relations with foreign leaders how they managed the economy how they managed the military and their overall political skill

To make sure the rankings are fair many surveys equally balance the opinions of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans

It is sometimes difficult to accurately rank a president because all of the presidents faced completely different challenges and lived in different times

Historical opinions of US presidents often change over time For example Harry Truman had very low approval ratings right after he left office but many historians now consider him among the greatest presidents

Most surveys agree that the top three presidents are

The following presidents are usually ranked highly

Some presidents have mixed ratings For example Andrew Jackson is considered to be a leader who stood for the common man but at the same time historians criticize him because of the Indian Removal Act

Jimmy Carter Chester Arthur William Howard Taft Benjamin Harrison Calvin Coolidge Herbert Hoover Rutherford B Hayes Martin Van Buren and Richard Nixon are considered to be below average

John Tyler Zachary Taylor Millard Fillmore Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan are often considered to be among the worst because they failed to prevent the growth of the slavery which resulted in the Civil War 

Andrew Johnson is often ranked among the worst because he was against the Reconstruction

Warren G Harding and Ulysses Grant are often considered to be among the worst presidents because they both made the mistake of appointing their corrupt friends into high political offices although recently Ulysses Grant has moved up in the rankings because of his efforts to give civil rights to African Americans

Both historian polls and popular opinion polls consider George W Bush among the worst US presidents although some would argue that it is too early to rank him because his term ended recently in 2009

William Henry Harrison and James Garfield are often not ranked because they both died shortly after becoming presidents 

Also Barack Obama is not ranked because his presidency has not ended yet For the same reason George W Bush and Bill Clinton are not ranked in some polls because there presidencies ended within the last ten years

The Reconstruction was after the American Civil War It was the remaking of the South after it had lost its war of rebellion and slavery was ended Andrew Johnson became President of the US after Lincolns assassination in 1865 He wanted to make it easy to restore local rule in the previously rebellious states and he permitted some of them to hold elections in 1865 Former Confederate leaders who ran as Democrats were re elected to Congress and states passed laws that denied rights to former slaves Many members of the Republican Party wanted stricter terms before local rule was returned to the South After the Republicans won a large majority of Congressional seats in the 1866 elections they refused to let former Confederate leaders take seats in the Congress The Republicans then passed laws that former leaders of the rebellion were not allowed to hold office and were not allowed to vote Three amendments to the US Constitution were passed  ending slavery making former slaves citizens and giving them the right to vote Some newly freed black slaves won elected offices After Reconstruction was ended in 1877 white people in the South used their regained political powers to pass Jim Crow Laws These laws enforced segregation and took the vote away from black people whose parents or grandparents were slaves The Ku Klux Klan was also formed to keep black people from having any kind of political and economic power After Reconstruction white Southerners voted mostly against the Republican Party for about 80 years

Troodontidae is a family of bird like theropod dinosaurs They were found mainly in Mongolia China and North America The first specimen just a single tooth was found in central Montana in 1855 by Ferdinand Hayden The family are known for their large brains a skull with many air pockets a retractable second toe claw and many teeth The number of teeth ranges from 96 in Saurornithoides mongoliensis to 120 in the Troodon

During most of the 20th century troodontid fossils were few and scrappy and they have therefore been linked at various times with many dinosaurian lineages More recent fossil discoveries of complete and articulated specimens have helped to increase understanding about this group In 1994 a fossil of an adult Troodon was found sitting on a nest with eight eggs

Anatomical studies particularly studies of the most primitive troodontids like Sinovenator demonstrate striking anatomical similarities with Archaeopteryx and primitive dromaeosaurs and demonstrate that they are relatives The clade is called Paraves

Sinovenator is a genus of troodontid dinosaur from China It is from the early Cretaceous Period Two fossils were found in the older portion of the Yixian Formation in China 1282 million years ago during the Barremian age The type specimen Sinovenator changii was described by Xu Norell Wang Makovicky and Wu in 2002 The type specimen is IVPP 12615 a partial skull and disarticulated skeleton A referred specimen is IVPP 12583 an incomplete but articulated postcranial skeleton Both are in the collection of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing China 

Sinovenator was a basal troodontid Sinovenator shares features with the most primitive dromaeosaurids and Avialae demonstrating the common inheritance of these three members of the Paraves Sinovenator was about the size of a chicken

The name Paraves was coined by Paul Sereno in 1997 The clade was defined by Sereno in 1998 as a branch based clade containing all Maniraptora closer to modern birds than to Oviraptor

The work of Xu and colleagues provide examples of basal and early paravians with four wings including members of the Avialae Dromaeosauridae and Troodontidae

The cladogram presented below follows a study by Zhang and colleagues

The Praetorian Guard was a force of bodyguards used by Roman Emperors The title was first used for the guards of generals in the Roman Republic Their commander the Praetorian Prefect was often an important figure in the political scheming in Rome The Guard was dissolved by Emperor Constantine I in the fourth century AD

The term Praetorian derived from the tent of the commanding general or praetor of a Roman army in the fieldthe praetorium It was a habit of many Roman generals to choose from the ranks a private force of soldiers to act as guards of their person This elite group of Roman citizens consisted of both infantry and cavalry In time this cohort came to be known as the cohors praetoria and various notable figures possessed one including Julius Caesar Mark Antony and Augustus 

As Caesar discovered with the 10th Legion Equestris a powerful mounted unit was desirable in the field When Augustus became the first ruler of the Roman Empire in 27 BC he decided such a formation was useful not only on the battlefield but in politics also Thus from the ranks of the legions throughout the provinces Augustus recruited the Praetorian Guard 

Through the cunning of their ambitious prefect Sejanus the Guard was brought from their Italian barracks into Rome itself In 23 Sejanus convinced Tiberius to have the Praetorian fort built just outside Rome One of the cohorts held the daily guard at the imperial palace Henceforth the entire Guard was at the disposal of the emperors but the rulers were now equally at the mercy of the Praetorians The reality of this was seen in 31 when Tiberius was forced to rely upon his own cohors praetoria against partisans of Sejanus Although the Praetorian Guard proved faithful to the aging Tiberius their potential political power had been made clear

While campaigning the Praetorians were the equal of any formation in the Roman Army Seldom used in the early reigns they were quite active by 69 Under Domitian and Trajan the guard took part in wars from Dacia to Mesopotamia while with Marcus Aurelius years were spent on the Danube frontier Throughout the 3rd century the Praetorians assisted the emperors in various campaigns

The relationship between the Guard and their Emperor was always sensitive Bribing the Guard is a common theme in Imperial history Sejanus almost took over the running of the Empire before Tiberius overcame and later executed him A number of Emperors were murdered or otherwise deposed by the Guard or with their knowledge The first was Caligula

Medical microbiology also known as clinical microbiology is the study of microbes such as bacteria viruses fungi and parasites which cause a human illness and their role in the disease 

The microbes and the branch of microbiology are the most studied due to their great importance to medicine 

Medical microbiology studies development and progress of the infectious disease in a patient and in human population It is related to the study of disease pathology and immunology It is a branch of medicine and microbiology and includes five sciences bacteriology virology parasitology immunology and mycology 

In 1546 Girolamo Fracastoro proposed that epidemic diseases were caused by transferable seed like entities through direct indirect contact and contact over long distances with an infection 

Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch are the founders of medical microbiology Louis Pasteur is famous for his experiments when he disproved the theory of spontaneous generation He offered method for food preservation and vaccines against anthrax fowl cholera and rabies Robert Koch contributed to the germ theory of disease provided that specific diseases were caused by specific microbes He developed criteria known as the Kochs postulates and was among first to isolate bacteria in pure culture resulting in his description of several bacteria including Mycobacterium tuberculosis the causative agent of tuberculosis

A medical microbiologist is a specialist in medical microbiology 

He provides clinical consultations on the investigation diagnosis and treatment of patients suffering from infectious diseases He establishes and directs infection control programs across public health care infectious disease prevention and epidemiology 

He provides the scientific and administrative direction of a clinical microbiology laboratory Such laboratory receives almost any clinical specimen including swabs feces urine blood sputum cerebrospinal fluid synovial fluid possible infected tissue The work here is mainly concerned with cultures to look for suspected pathogens which if found are identified based on biochemical tests In addition sensitivity testing is carried out to determine whether the pathogen is sensitive or resistant to a suggested medicine Results are reported with the identified organism and the type and amount of drug that should be prescribed for the patient

Medical microbiologist is also involved in teaching at all levels and in research It provided the development of vaccines against invading organisms Deadly and debilitating diseases such as small pox polio and tuberculosis have been either eradicated or become more treatable There are claims that consuming probiotics andor prebiotics contributes to human health Microorganisms could be useful in the treatment of cancer Strains of non pathogenic clostridia can infiltrate and replicate within solid tumors deliver therapeutic proteins

Sejanus was an ambitious soldier friend and confidant of the Roman Emperor Tiberius An equestrian by birth Sejanus rose to power as Praetorian Prefect He commanded the Roman imperial bodyguard the Praetorian Guard from AD 14 until his death in 31

After the Praetorian Guard was established under Augustus Sejanus introduced reforms which saw the unit go from a mere bodyguard to an influential branch of the government It controlled public security and influenced civil administration Most important of all it influenced the succession of emperors all needed the goodwill and support of the Guard These changes would have a lasting impact on the Empire

During the 20s Sejanus gradually accumulated power by influencing Tiberius and eliminating potential political opponents including the emperors son Drusus When Tiberius withdrew to Capri in 26 Sejanus was left in control of the entire state mechanism as de facto ruler of the empire For a time the most influential and feared citizen of Rome Sejanus suddenly fell from power in 31 the year his career culminated with the consulship Amidst suspicions of conspiracy against Tiberius Sejanus was arrested and executed along with his followers

In 29 Sejanus began a series of purge trials of senators and wealthy equestrians in the city removing those capable of opposing his power adding to the imperial treasury Networks of spies and informers brought the victims to trial with false accusations of treason and many chose suicide over the disgrace of being condemned and executed Only Caligula the last remaining son of Germanicus managed to survive the purges of Sejanus He had moved to Capri to be with Tiberius in 31

Through years of crafty intrigues and indispensable service to the emperor Sejanus had worked himself up to become the most powerful man in the empire Exactly what caused his sudden downfall is unclear According to Josephus it was Antonia the mother of Livilla who finally alerted Tiberius to the growing threat Sejanus posed She sent a letter to Capri in the care of her freedman Pallas

By the end of 31 he would be arrested summarily executed and his body unceremoniously cast down Tiberius resigned his post of Consul which forced Sejanus to do likewise This removed much of Sejanus legal powers and protection Another man Macro was appointed as Praetorian Prefect Sejanus was summoned to a meeting of the Senate where a letter from Tiberius was read condemning Sejanus and ordering his immediate execution Following an issue of damnatio memoriae by the Senate his statues were torn down and his name obliterated from public records Although Rome at first rejoiced at the death of Sejanus the city quickly plunged into more extensive trials as Tiberius relentlessly persecuted all those who could in any way be tied to the schemes of Sejanus or had courted his friendship This included all the children of Sejanus

The term media center refers either to a dedicated computer appliance or to a specialized application software designed to run on standard personal computer hardware which then becomes a so called HTPC both of which are adapted for playing various kinds of media A media center usually has a GUI designed to be used with a living room TV using a remote control This remote control is commonly known by their designers as a 10 foot user interface A media center typically allows one to watch movies and watching and recording television broadcasts playing audio

The media itself may be stored received by terrestrial satellite or cable broadcasting or streamed from the internet Stored media is kept either on a local hard drive or on a network attached storage Some software is capable of doing other tasks such as finding news from the Internet Media centers are often operated with a remote control connected to a television set for video output and can sometimes function as a normal personal computer

A media center can be purpose built modified or created individuals by adding media center software to a PC or some other computer for example a Home Theater PC or an Xbox Lately some video game consoles with their network services can also act as a basic media center device by default

The relationship between a doctor and a patient is a very important part of medicine Only when there is a good relationship between the two is it possible to have high quality healthcare This relationship is also at the base of medical ethics Many medical schools teach the doctors to be to keep a professional relationship with their patients to respect the patients dignity and privacy 

This relationship has asymmetric information though The doctor knows more than the patient but has to explain the patients situation and has to ask the patient what treatments should be done There is a very similar relationship between the patient and nurses psychologists

There are different legal norms that regulate this relationship Examples of such norms are the Hippocratic oath the Declaration of Geneva Professional responsibility may also govern such a relationship

Ideally patient and doctor trust each other If they do this can have a positive influence on the development of disease or condition Healing can be hindered if the patient does not take the prescribed drugs of if these drugs are not taken in the doses prescribed

If the relationship is too good this can preclude efficiency In certain cases it may be good to get the opinion of a second doctor regarding a condition

Army ant means over 200 ant species They are called army ants due to their aggressive predatory groups looking for food known as raids in which many ants look for food at the same time in one place attacking other animals en masse

Most ant species make homes where they always live Army ants do not They keep moving All army ant species are members of the ant family FormicidaeCitation neededdateJanuary 2009 but there are several kinds that have evolved on their own the same behavior This is called legionary behavior and is convergent evolution

Before army ant meant ants from 5 different ant subfamilies in two of these subfamilies the Ponerinae and Myrmicinae it is only a few species that show legionary behavior in the other three subfamilies Ecitoninae Dorylinae and Leptanillinae all of the species are legionary Now another subfamily Leptanilloidinae is called army ants

A 2003 study of thirty species shows that the ecitonine and doryline army ants evolved from one group in the mid Cretaceous period in Gondwana and so the two subfamilies are now one called Ecitoninae but not everyone says this

These are army ants

An irrational number is defined to be any number that is the part of the real number system that cannot be written as a complete ratio of two integers

An irrational number cannot be fully written down in decimal form It would have an infinite number of digits after the decimal point These digits would also not repeat

Irrational numbers often occur in geometry For instance if we have a square which has sides of 1 meter the distance between opposite corners is the square root of two meters This is an irrational number In decimal for it is written as 1414213 Mathematicians have proved that the square root of every natural number is either an integer or an irrational number

One well known irrational number is pi This is the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter This number is the same for every circle The number pi is approximately 31415926359

In physics a phonon is a quantized lattice vibration The word quantized is used in physics to mean that only certain values of something are allowed Something that is quantized can be thought of as stairs you can only move from step to step and you cant stand in between steps Something that is not quantized can be thought of as a ramp or smooth incline you can move any distance up or down A lattice is the repeating or periodic structure of a crystal A crystal is made up of atoms or molecules in a certain pattern The points on the pattern at which the atoms or molecules are located is the lattice Solids liquids and gases can all experience vibrations A vibration being quantized means that only certain frequencies of vibrations are allowed

Intuitively there is no reason for lattice vibrations to be quantized The macroscopic or large scale vibrations of a material are not quantized and can take on essentially any frequency It is only when we consider the tiny vibrations of the particles that make up a materialatoms and moleculesthat the concept of quantization and phonons becomes important To understand why phonons exist complicated quantum mechanics is needed Without going into too much detail the interactions between the constituent atoms or molecules of a crystal are analyzed quantum mechanically Because of their arrangement in a pattern that repeats when one arrives at a mathematical expression for the frequency of oscillation one finds that there are only distinct quantized values allowed There is unfortunately no simple way to explain this

The Lymington branch line is a short line running between Brockenhurst and Lymington Pier The line is operated by South West Trains There is a station in between called Lymington Town The short length of track between Lymington Town and Lymington Pier has a line speed of 20mph

The two preserved 421cig units make the line a popluar destination for rail fans Unit 1497 Freshwater was painted in British Rail White and Blue while 1498 Farringford was painted in BR Green The units were given names of places on the Isle of Wight as they only ran on this line Until 22 May 22 2010 they were the only EMU slamdoor units still in operation anywhere in Britain

The line is now operated by 1589 sprinter units This means the 750Volt DC electric has no longer got a use This may seem strange as most parts of the country are electrifiying lines The reason for this is that 450 units have 4 cars which are too long for Lymington Town Station And South West Trains are not willing to remove a coach from a 450 unit The only solution then is to use DMU 3 car sprinter units

The Gaza strip is part of the Palestinian Arab nation of Palestine It is amongst the most densely populated areas on Earth About 15 million people live on a surface of roughly 493 km

The Palestinian Authority says that this is an occupied territory They say Israel is the occupation force and it should withdraw and give the territory back to the Palestinians Israel has attacked and bombed Gaza several times most recently during December of 2008

Israel does not see things this way since they gave over the territory to Palestinian administration in 2005 and have pulled back their troops over time Meanwhile Hamas the Palestinian group which controls the territory has launched its rockets at Israel

Hamas took over the Gaza Strip since the FatahHamas conflict that was after the 2006 Palestinian elections Israel said Hamas to be a terrorist movement Likewise Egypt did not agree with Hamas removeing the Palestinian Authority officials from Gaza 

The Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip was said to be a safety measure by Israel but the Free Gaza Movement are opposed Hamas along with other groups had been causing trouble there and in southern parts of Israel The blocked started in 2007 Many countries feal sorry for the Gaza Strip a few others hate or some how fear Israel and some agree with Israel

goto is a statement in many programming languages It is a combination of the English words go and to It is a way to jump to another line of code

Many languages support the goto statement and many do not In Java goto is a reserved word but cannot be used

In Computer Science there is a theory called the structured program theorem This theory says that any program can be written in such a way that things are done with functions and methods instead of in one very big program and goto statements The theory proves that the goto statement is not needed to write programs

A goto statement is usually used with a label A label is a word that identifies a place in a piece of code A goto statement in code usually looks like this

In this example the computer would jump to the location of LABEL

Many times the goto statement is combined with the if statement In this case the computer will only jump to another place in the code if something is true For example

This can be read as if some condition is true then go to the location of LABEL

Different programming languages have different restrictions or limits on the use of goto statements For example the C programming language does not allow a goto to jump to a location inside of another function

The Snowy River is a major river in south eastern Australia It starts on the slopes of Mount Kosciuszko Australias highest mountain It gets its water from the eastern slopes of the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales and then flows through the Snowy River National Park in Victoria and finally into Bass Strait Up until the middle of the 20th century the river was known for the large amount of fresh water it carried its wide reach and large rapids 

The rivers course and surroundings have not changed very much as it is protected by the Snowy River National Park However its flow of water was almost stopped in the 1950s by the building of the Snowy Mountains Scheme to make hydroelectricity Four large dams were built at Guthega Island Bend Eucumbene and Jindabyne as well as many smaller dams and tunnels Less than 1 of the river flow as measured at Jindabyne New South Wales continued to flow down the river Concern over the health of river led to an agreement between the state and federal governments to increase the amount of water released back into the river From 2002 to 2008 the flow was increased from 1 to 4 The agreement planned to increase the flow to 15 by 2009 and 21 by 2012

Mall of America is a large shopping mall in the Twin Cities suburb of Bloomington Minnesota USA The mall is southeast of the junction of Interstate 494 and Minnesota State Highway 77 north of the Minnesota River and is across the interstate from the Minneapolis St Paul International Airport In the United States it is the second largest inside mall in terms of retail space but is largest in terms of total enclosed floor area Opened in 1992 the mall received 40 million visitors in 2006 Triple Five Group owned by the Ghermezian family of Canada fully owns and manages the property

Mall of America has a gross area of 42 million square feet with 25 million sq ft available as retail space The mall is a nearly symmetric building with a roughly rectangular floor plan Over 520 stores are arranged along three levels of pedestrian walkways on the sides of the rectangle with a fourth level on the East side An addition planned north of the mall will allow for up to 900 stores Four anchor department stores are at the corners The Mall is organized into four different zones each with its own decorative style

Despite Minnesotas often cold temperatures in the winter only the malls entrances are heated Heat is allowed in through skylights above Nickelodeon Universe Heat is produced by lighting fixtures other electric devices and also by employees and guests of the mall in sufficient amounts to keep it comfortable In fact even during the winter air conditioning systems need to be run nonstop during peak hours to ensure a comfortable shopping environmentCitation neededdateJuly 2008

Although the common areas are unheated the individual stores do have heating systems 

Two nearly identical seven story parking ramps on east and west sides provide 12550 parking spaces Parking lots on the north and south of the building along with nearby overflow parking bring the total number of spaces up to approximately 20000

The mall was designed and built by Triple Five Group owned by the Ghermezian brothers of Canada who also own the biggest shopping mall in North America the West Edmonton Mall Mall of America is on the past site of Metropolitan Stadium where the Minnesota Vikings and Minnesota Twins played until the Hubert H Humphrey Metrodome opened The teams left Metropolitan Stadium in 1982 A plaque in the amusement park is where home plate used to be in that stadium One seat from Met Stadium was placed in Mall of America at its exact location in the stadium to recognize a 520 foot home run hit by hall of famer Harmon Killebrew on June 3 1967

In 1986 The Bloomington Port Authority signed an agreement with the Ghermezian Organization Groundbreaking for the mall took place on June 14 1989 Organizations involved include Melvin Simon and Associates Teachers Insurance and Annuity the Triple Five Group and the office of architect Jon Jerde

The mall opened its doors to the public August 11 1992 Even before opening Mall of America had earned several nicknames including The Megamall Sprawl of America Hugedale and simply The Mall

It became the second largest shopping mall in total area and largest in total store vendors in the United States when it opened however the mall has never been the largest in the worldCitation neededdateAugust 2007 Mall of America is the most visited shopping mall in the world with more than 40 million visitors annually The mall employs over 12000 workers

Starting on September 4 1995 The Mall had an event for live television for the first time Time Warner owned professional wrestling company World Championship Wrestling set up in the building for the Inaugural edition of WCW Monday Nitro  also the WCW debut of Lex Luger under his The Narcissist gimmick This first broadcast on Turner Network Television along with later editions broadcast from the Mall would become a well known part of the federations competition with The World Wrestling Federation

During its run as a large entertainment and retail venue certain aspects such as have been criticized and closely looked at A Mardi Gras themed bar Fat Tuesdays shut its doors in early 2000 due to indecent exposure and alcohol related offenses for ignoring warnings from the mall and Bloomington police to not repeat incidents caught on tape the year before Following that incident were other problems such as foot traffic within the Mall after the bars had closed for the evening The Mall storefronts were closed however The Hooters restaurant the Cantina 1 restaurant and the Theatres at Mall of America movie theater are the only establishments remaining on the fourth floor

In 2003 after a six year legal battle between Simon Property Group the managing general partner of the property and the Ghermezian brothersTriple Five Group over majority ownership of the site a federal appeals judge ruled in favor of the Ghermezians effectively transferring control and planning authority of the mall back to its original founders The dispute stemmed from a 1999 purchase of Teachers Insurances 275 equity stake by Simon Properties giving them majority ownership The Ghermezians claimed they were never told of the deal and sued Simon citing fiduciary responsibility

On November 3 2006 the Ghermezians gained full control of Mall of America spending US1 billion to do so The ruling cleared the way for Triple Five to begin work on what is being called Phase II

Phase II is the planned expansion for MOA developing a large empty area of land north of the mall which was the former home of the Met Center indoor arena and integrating an IKEA store built on a portion of the property in 2004 Phase II in current form includes a dinner theatre ice rink three hotels and a waterpark similar in design to the West Edmonton Mall The expansion will not make MOA exceed the size of the WEM 

MOA currently estimates costs of 19 billion for the expansion doubling the malls size with a 52 million square foot extension The malls developers have asked for 234 million in state and local subsidies but the request was vetoed as part of a larger bill by Gov Tim Pawlenty on its first appearance in the 2006 07 session Questions have arisen among Bloomington city officials as to the fiscal ability of the Ghermezians to finish Phase II

In the meantime MOA has signed papers to bring in Great Wolf Resorts as the waterpark operator as well as Bass Pro Shops and a Kimpton Hotel The expansion section will connect to the mall on all four levels and an adjacent IKEA store via a second level bridge There will be an NHL sized ice rink for public private skating There will also be an additional parking ramp adding 8000 parking spaces

There will also be fine art exhibits planned in the expansion and two upscale department stores Another plan that was in the works would have been fashions architecture and restaurants based after Europe

On May 18 2008 the Minnesota State Legislature passed a bill granting the city of Bloomington the right to raise property and sales taxes to pay for the MOA expansion

Nickelodeon Universe is an indoor theme park in the center of the mall formerly known as Knotts Camp Snoopy Camp Snoopy and The Park at MOA The park features roller coasters among numerous other rides and attractions and is the largest indoor theme park in the United States Unlike many indoor amusement parks Nickelodeon Universe has a great deal of natural foliage in and about the park and its floor has a wide variance in height  the highest ground level in the park is 15 feet above the lowest This allows for a far more naturalistic experience than would normally occur in an indoor amusement park

The park features two new roller coasters SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge and Avatar Airbender It also has a miniature golfing section called Moose Mountain With 18 holes it is designed to create a challenge for players hoping to seek a hole in one

Guests travel through a 300 foot long curved tunnel through 14 feet of water to view over 4500 sea creatures including sharks turtles stingrays and many more Underwater Adventures offers special events such as sleepovers scuba diving snorkeling and birthday parties

Twin Cities public events

The mall is used as a major transportation hub in the region with bus and light rail service linking the mall to other destinations Regular public transit service is provided by Metro Transit and other area bus lines and nearby Mystic Lake Casino offers free shuttles to their establishment The primary busrail station for scheduled local service is in the lower level of the eastern parking ramp There the Hiawatha Line light rail line connects the mall to the Minneapolis Saint Paul International Airport and from there to downtown Minneapolis The mall is being discouraged as a park and ride facility and overnight parking is banned to prevent passengers taking the train to the airport Commuters are encouraged to use the nearby 28th Avenue Stations parking lot The mall is the first stop on the Cedar Avenue Bus Rapid Transitway and the nineteenth final stop on the Hiawatha Line

Painful sexual act is a condition of repeated or persistent genital pain before during or after sexual act due to physical psychogenic and emotional causes Doctors call the condition as dyspareunia It occurs in women and men The condition affects up to one fifth of women at some point in their lives

The woman experiencing painful sexual act may be distracted from feeling pleasure and excitement Both lubrication of vagina and vaginal dilation decrease When the vagina is dry and undilated thrusting of the penis is painful Even after the original source of pain has disappeared a woman may feel pain simply because she expects pain 

In the majority of instances there is an original physical cause There are numerous physical conditions that can contribute to painful sexual act A careful physical examination and medical history are indicated Common physical causes include infections of the vagina lower urinary tract cervix or fallopian tubes endometriosis surgical scar tissue and ovarian cysts and tumors Among the infections are mycotic organisms candidiasis chlamydia trichomoniasis urinary tract infections coliform bacteria monilial organisms and herpes  Anatomic conditions such as hymenal remnants female genital mutilation when the entrance to the vagina has become too small for normal penetration can contribute to discomfort of sexual act Estrogen deficiency is a common cause of painful sexual act among women after menopause Dryness of the vagina is often reported by lactating women Women undergoing radiation therapy for pelvic malignancy experience painful sexual act due to the atrophy of the vaginal walls and their susceptibility to trauma Vaginal dryness is seen in Sjgrens syndrome which attacks the exocrine glands that produce saliva and tears 

Painful sexual act may be one of the first symptoms of a cystitis Patients may struggle with bladder pain and discomfort during or after sex For women with cystitis pain usually occurs the following day the result of painful spasming muscles of pelvis floor Cystitis patients also struggle with urinary frequency andor urinary urgency

There are a number of physical factors as well Pain is sometimes experienced in the testicular or glans area of the penis immediately after ejaculation Infections of the prostate bladder or seminal vesicles can lead to burning or itching sensations following ejaculation Men suffering from cystitis may experience intense pain at the moment of ejaculation and is focused at the tip of the penis Gonorrheal infections are associated with burning or sharp penis pains during ejaculation Urethritis or prostatitis can make genital stimulation painful or uncomfortable Anatomic deformities of the penis may also result in pain during sexual act 

In men pain in the genital organs during ejaculation or immediately thereafter is experienced as sharp stabbing andor burning it may be persistent and returning The duration of pain is usually brief The immediate cause of psychogenic post ejaculatory pain is the involuntary painful spasm or cramping of certain pain sensitive muscles in the male genital and reproductive organs the painful muscle cramps may be attributable to a mans conflict about ejaculating 

A pelvic floor disorder can also be the cause of pain during and after sex

Sufferers will see several doctors before a correct diagnosis is made Sufferers are also often hesitant to seek treatment for chronic vulvar pain especially since many women begin experiencing symptoms around the same time they become sexually active Before being successfully diagnosed patients sometimes are told that the pain is in their head For the diagnosis doctor carefully takes a history and carefully examines the pelvis to duplicate the discomfort and to identify a site or source of the pelvic pain The diagnosis of painful sexual act has to be differentiated from conditions known as chronic vulvar pain and vaginismus It is worth to be sure whether the painful sexual act is acquired or lifelong and whether it is generalized or situational During the first two weeks painful sexual act caused by penis insertion or movement of the penis in the vagina or by deep penetration is often due to disease or injury deep within the pelvis Inquiry should determine whether the pain is superficial or deep  whether it occurs primarily at the vaginal outlet or vaginal barrel or upon deep thrusting against the cervix The possible role of psychological factors in either causing or maintaining the pain must be acknowledged 

Atrophy of vagina as a source of painful sexual act is most frequently seen in women after menopause and is generally associated with estrogen deficiency The latter is associated with inadequacy of lubrication of vagina which can lead to painful friction during sexual act

The Nematomorpha are a phylum of parasitic animals that look similar to nematode worms and live in similar environments That is why their names are similar They are sometimes called Gordiacea and are also known as Horsehair worms 

They range in size from convert50to100cmin long and can reach in extreme cases up to 2 meters and they are convert1to3mm in diameter Horsehair worms can be discovered in damp areas such as watering troughs streams puddles and cisterns 

About 326 species are known and an estimate suggests that there may be about 2000 species worldwide 

Fossilized worms have been reported from Lower Cretaceous Burmese amber 100110 million years ago

The adult worms are free living and in North America are usually found only in the summer months in or near shallow water

The larvae are parasitic on beetles cockroaches and Orthoptera These are their final hosts but since they do not live in water the nematomorph life cycle has an extra stage 

A day or two after they come out of their hosts the adult worms mate in the water and then around mid August or Mid October they lay their eggs in the water It takes about a month for the larvae to develop inside the egg Once the larvae hatch they somehow get into gastropods insects or earthworms which live in moist habitats There they build a cyst and grow The animal they grow inside is called an interim host because a final host is still needed

Next developing nematomorph worms can be found in their final hosts It is not clear how they get there but probably the final host eats the interim host with the larvae inside them After they appear in the final host the nematomorphs begin to eat it from the inside

The nematomorph may control the host leading it towards water and even causing it to jump into the water Then it breaks out of the beetle in or near the water and finds a knot of other worms mating

The Burgess Shale Formation in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia is one of the worlds most celebrated fossil fields and the best of its kind It is famous for the exceptional preservation of the soft parts of its fossils It is 505 million years old one of the earliest soft parts fossil beds

The rock unit is a black shale and crops out at a number of localities near the town of Field in the Yoho National Park

The Burgess Shale was discovered by palaeontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott in 1909 towards the end of the seasons fieldwork He returned in 1910 with his sons and established a quarry on the flanks of Fossil Ridge The fact that fossils were of soft bodied forms and the range of organisms new to science led him to return to the quarry almost every year until 1924 At this point aged 74 he had amassed over 65000 specimens 

Describing the fossils was a vast task pursued by Walcott until his death in 1927 Walcott led by scientific opinion at the time attempted to categorise all fossils into living taxa As a result the fossils were regarded as little more than curiosities at the time It was not until 1962 that a first hand reinvestigation of the fossils was attempted by Alberto Simonetta This led scientists to recognise that Walcott had barely scratched the surface of information available in the Burgess Shale

A second quarry was opened A thorough reassessment of the Burgess Shale showed that the fauna were much more varied and unusual than Walcott had realised Many of the animals present had bizarre anatomical features and only the slightest resemblance to other known animals Examples include Opabinia with five eyes and a snout like a vacuum cleaner hose Nectocaris which resembles either a crustacean with fins or a vertebrate with a shell and Hallucigenia This last was originally reconstructed upside down walking on its spines

Self pollination is when pollen is transferred from the anther to the stigma in the same plant

The Solnhofen limestone is the worlds most famous fossil site It is a lagersttte of Upper Jurassic limestone which has preserved many fossils in great detail The specimens of Archaeopteryx are perhaps the worlds most valuable fossils because they are the ealiest fossils of a bird capable of flight

The Solnhofen beds lie in the German state of Bavaria halfway between Nuremberg and Munich They were originally quarried as a source of limestone for lithography

In the late Jurassic this area was an archipelago at the edge of the Tethys Sea This included placid lagoons which had limited access to the open sea because they were surrounded by coral reefs Water runoff from the land was low and under the sun evaporation was high Salinity rose so high that the resulting brine could not support life except at the top of the water column

The lowest water was devoid of oxygen by lack of water mixing and rapid evaporation Many ordinary scavengers were absent It also follows that almost all of the fossilised animals were not living in the lagoon They must have lived on land in the air or out to sea beyond the reef Then when they died they fell drifted or were washed into the lagoons from the air ocean or land Occasional storms at sea would have killed flying animals and swept fish over the reef in a suspension of finely dispersed lime There the bodies sank into the dead zone and were preserved

Once in the lagoon bodies became buried in soft carbonate mud Thus many delicate creatures avoided consumption by scavengers or being torn apart by currents The wings of dragonflies the imprints of stray feathers and terrestrial plants that washed into the lagoons were all preserved The fossils are not numerous but some of them are spectacular and their range gives a comprehensive picture of a local Jurassic ecosystem

At times the lagoons almost dried out exposing sticky carbonate muds that trapped insects and even a few small dinosaurs Over 600 species have been identified Seven genera and up to 29 species of pterosaur have been found This suggests that in this ecosystem pterosaurs were more common and diversified than birds The pterosaur sizes ranged from that of a sparrow to 12 m in length

The fine grained texture of the mud silt forming the limestone is ideal for making lithographic plates for printing illustrations Extensive quarrying in the 19th century revealed many fossil finds as commemorated in the name Archaeopteryx lithographica all the specimens of which come from these deposits The closest modern analogue to the Solnhofen conditions is said to be Orca Basin in the northern Gulf of Mexico though that area is much deeper than the Solnhofen lagoons

Aenictogiton is a genus of ants The genus has seven species The genus is given its own subfamily Aenictogitoninae All of the species are known only from males from middle Africa and show a phylogenetic liking to the army ants Nothing is known about the workers queens and behavior of these ants A few not described species are known to exist in a few collections in the world

Ketosis occurs when ketone bodies are released into the bloodstream due to low glycogen levels in the liver Ketone bodies are created by the breakdown of fatty acid

The body goes through ketosis when there is not enough carbohydrate to refill glycogen in the liver An example of this kind of diet is the Atkins diet where followers start by eating fewer than 20g of carbohydrates per day It takes 48 hours for the brain to switch from glucose to ketone bodies Ketosis helps the body prevent using protein from muscles for gluconeogenesis to make glucose

Rhabomyosarcoma is a form of soft tissue sarcoma that occurs often in children It has differnt cellular subtypes including embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and aveolar rhabdomyosarcoma Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma is the cellular subtype in slightly more than half of patients It can arise in the parameningeal area genitourinary region in the eye area in and around the head and neck or extremities 

Rhabdomyosarcoma is usually treated with radiation chemotherapy and surgery if it has not spread beyond the primary site

Patients whose disease has not spread beyond the primary tumor have a five year survival rate of up to 80 when treated well but patients whose disease has spread past the primary tumor have a five year survival rate of only 30

The term underweight refers to humans that have much less weight than they should Being underweight is bad for the overall health of the person affected It is normal what a persons weights changes over time Being underweight is often defined using a measure called the body mass index which calculates a score based on height and weight If this score is below 185 a person is generally said to be underweight This is only a general indication though as the scores must not be calculated for everyone It does not apply to children and adolescents for example

Being underweight can have different causes

There are problems that are related to being underweight Very often being underweight is not the first problem Rather it often is the effect of another condition or disease Unexpected weight loss requires the attention of a doctor There might be another disease If that disease is treated the weight problem also disappears

Another problem underweight people face is that the weight problem affects their health Their immune system is weakened and they may get sick more often People who are underweight because they cannot get or afford the right food need special attention Women who are underweight may not have their menstruation and face difficult pregnancies

Once they were being underweight psychically they may feel sad and worried about their health Therefore family and friends should support them to help them get rid of their unhappiness

The pot in pot refrigerator also known as a Zeer in Arabic is a food cooling device which keeps food cool without electricity by using evaporation

It is made by putting a clay pot inside a larger clay pot with wet sand in between the pots and a wet cloth on top As the water evaporates it cools the inside letting food stored in the inner pot to be kept fresh for some time It must be placed in a dry ventilated place for the water to evaporate to the outside

Evaporative coolers perform poorly or not at all in climates with high humidity

Although Mohammed Bah Abba of Nigeria patented the device in 1995 and was awarded a Rolex Laureate in 2000 for developing the pot in pot preservationcooling system the device was known at least as early as the Middle Kingdom of Egypt as seen by the hieroglyphic kbb to cool

The Jehol biota includes all the living organisms the ecosystem of northeastern China between 133 to 120 million years ago This is the Lower Cretaceous ecosystem which left fossils in the Yixian Formation some 125121 mya and the Jiufotang Formation It is also believed to have left fossils in the Sinuiju series of North Korea 

The ecosystem in the Lower Cretaceous was dominated by wetlands and numerous lakes Rainfall was seasonal alternating between semi arid and mesic conditions The climate was temperate The Jehol ecosystem was interrupted at times by ash eruptions from volcanoes to the west The word Jehol was the name given during the Japanese occupation of North East China 19331946

The Jehol Biota is particularly noteworthy for the very high diversity of fossils and the very large numbers of individuals of each species that have been recovered The biota includes many species that were previously known only from the Upper Jurassic or earlier These include the dinosaur Sinosauropteryx the pterosaur Dendrorhynchoides and even a primitive protomammal a tritylodont synapsid from Lower Cretaceous Japan even though tritylodonts were previously thought to have gone extinct in the Middle Jurassic It also has the earliest and most basal known members of groups which spread all around the world by the Upper Cretaceous including neoceratopsians therizinosaurs tyrannosaurs and oviraptors

The Jehol Biota has produced fossils of plant mega and microfossils including the earliest angiosperms charophytes and dinocysts snails clams superabundant aquatic arthropods called conchostracans ostracods shrimps insects spiders fish frogs and salamanders turtles choristoderes lizards pterosaurs and dinosaurs including dinobirds the largest mammals known from the Mesozoic and a great diversity of birds including the earliest advanced birds and the smallest and largest birds known from the Mesozoic

The forests around the lakes were dominated by conifers including members of the podocarp pine araucaria and cypress families There were also ginkgos bennettitaleans ephedra horsetails ferns and mosses The leaves and needles of the trees show adaptations to a dry season but some of the ferns and mosses are types that grow in very wet habitats It is possible that the latter avoided dry conditions by growing very close to bodies of water Archaefructus has been described as the earliest known flowering plant and it is reconstructed as a water plant

The fossils have been found in several sites of exceptional preservation The two most famous are the Yixian and Jiufotang Formations The Yixian and Jiufotang Formations are Lagerstatten meaning that they have exceptionally good conditions for fossil preservation The fossils are numerous but also very well preserved They often have articulated skeletons soft tissues colour patterns stomach contents and twigs with leaves and flowers still attached 

Palaeontologists deduced two things from this The first is that the land animals and plants were washed into the lakes very gently or were already in the lakes when they died They do not show the damage seen in fossils formed by large floods Second volcanic ash is commonly interbedded with lake sediments and ashfalls seem to have quickly buried the fossilized organisms created anoxic conditions around them and prevented scavenging

The biota probably extended as far as North Korea Its earliest appearance may be in another Chinese lagersttte the Huajiying Formation

A geological formation in Liaoning NE China Outstanding preservation in deposits of siliclastic sediment alternating with basalt First recognised by the Japanese when they occupied Manchuria Dates 125121 million years ago Contains the famous Confuciusornis beds

The Jiufotang Formation is a Lower Cretaceous geological formation in Liaoning It has yielded fossils of feathered dinosaurs primitive birds pterosaurs and other organisms 

The exact age of the Jiufotang has been debated for years with estimates ranging from the Upper Jurassic to the Lower Cretaceous Argon radiometry confirmed a Lower Cretaceous age for the site 1203 07 million years ago Fossils of Microraptor and Jeholornis are from the Jiufotang

Lower Cretaceous but exact dates uncertain This is probably the earliest of the Jehol biota lagersttte sites Contains sedimentary members interspersed with volcanic ash Contains birds dinosaurs and fish

Digital rights are the rights of people regarding what they can do with their computer There are many cases that need special thought related to digital rights such as the right to have data accessible to a few people and freedom of expression Very often the word is used when referring to computer networks such as the Internet 

In 2003 the United Nations held a special talk called the World Summit on the Information Society One of the tasks of this talk was to make the digital divide smaller The digital divide separates countries into rich ones and poor ones For poor countries accessing the internet is much more hard After long talks all people in the talk signed a closing statement

The statement pointed out that human rights were universal and that they could not be divided They were also related to the basic freedoms that the Vienna Declaration had defined and could not be separated from them In addition democracy as well as sustainable development should be respected and the rule of law should be made stronger

This declaration also makes specific reference to the importance of the right to freedom of expression in the Information Society It says

 We reaffirm as an essential foundation of the Information Society and as outlined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers Communication is a fundamental social process a basic human need and the foundation of all social organization It is central to the Information Society Everyone everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits of the Information Society offers 

Digital rights management is in this area as an example

The Enigma machine was created for Germany by Arthur Scherbius in World War I It is a form of changing the letters of a message so that it appears to be scrambled letters Think of the machine as a typewriter combined with a fancy odometer The theory behind the machine is that each letter typed should be shifted by a random number This is accomplished by three rotors which rotate once per letter when a rotor shifts it defines a new electrical pathway So as the message is typed the rotors move along to define new shifts each letter A video explains this simplified version of the Enigma  Watch Simplified Enigma

However the Allies found out how to read messages in the Enigma code during World War II A team called Ultra including Alan Turing figured it out

On 15th July 2011 Queen Elizabeth visited Bletchley Park where the machine is kept in the Museum paid tribute to those who created this amazing code breaker since the use of it cut short World War by successfully breaking the complex codes by Nazi Germany

Heterodontosauridae is a family of early ornithischian dinosaurs

They have often been considered basal ornithopods although recent studies suggest they may have been more closely related to marginocephalians Although their fossils are rare they lived around the globe beginning in the Upper Triassic and may have persisted into the Lower Cretaceous

A large gap called a diastema separated the premaxillary teeth from the those of the maxilla in many ornithischia but this diastema was arched in heterodontosaurs 

The mandible was tipped by the predentary a bone unique to ornithischia This bone also supported a beak similar to the one found on the premaxilla All the teeth in the lower jaw were found on the dentary bone

Heterodontosaurids are named for their strongly heterodont teeth There were three premaxillary teeth In the early Jurassic Abrictosaurus Heterodontosaurus and Lycorhinus the first two premaxillary teeth were small and conical while the much larger third tooth resembled the canines of carnivoran mammals and is often called the caniniform or tusk

A vuvuzela is a blowing horn used in soccer games in South Africa They are also called lepatas or a stadium horn To blow this horn the lip and lung strength of the blower has to be strong to make a sound like a foghorn or an elephant

The vuvuzela was originally made out of tin It became very popular in South Africa in the 1990s A fan of the Kaizer Chiefs FC named Freddie Saddam Maake says that he invented the vuvuzela He got the idea from the aluminium 1965 bicycle horn and after taking off the black rubber he blew it After that he thought it was too short and so he joined a pipe to make it longer He has kept photos of himself in South African soccer games holding the aluminium vuvuzela He says the instrument was not allowed to be used because it was thought of as a dangerous weapon Because of this he tried to find a plastic company that could make it safer 

In 2001 South Africa based company Masincedane Sport began to sell the plastic version Neil van Schalkwyk the co owner of Masincedane Sport won the SAB KickStart Award in 2001

Vuvuzelas have been said to be rooted in African history but this is argued between many historians South African people used to blow on a kudu horn to call villagers to a meeting Also there is a South African saying that A baboon is killed by a lot of noise Similar horns have been made for a long time by many people A horn that looks identical to a vuvuzela is seen in Winslow Homers woodcut The Dinner Horn from the 1870s

In the 2010 World Cup vuvuzelas were in the news all over the world because it was normal in South Africa for them to be blown at football matches The world football governing body FIFA did not want to allow the use of vuvuzelas This was because they were afraid that broken wikt linkhooliganhooligans might use the instrument as a weapon and that businesses could put advertisements on vuvuzelas However the South African Football Association said that vuvuzelas were important for South African games and FIFA decided in July 2008 to let the instruments be used 

Some football players and audiences did not like the vuvuzelas The Lee Dixon of the BBC Three said that the sounds were quite broken wikt linkirritateirritating The European broadcasters also complained to the FIFA that they could not hear the commentators because of the sound

Vuvuzelas have also caused problems With a Vuvuzela high sound pressure levels can be reached These are about 120 dB at a distance of one metre and about 191 db next to the instrument There have been moves to prohibit the use of vuvuzelas in certain public viewing areas because they can damage hearing and because their sound may be louder than that of emergency broadcasts Demand for earplugs to protect from hearing loss during the World Cup was bigger than the available supply Many pharmacies ran out of stock Neil van Schalkwyk manufacturer of the plastic vuvuzela began selling earplugs to fans After the World Cup 2010 vuvuzelas started to be banned in other countries In Britain Tottenham Hotspur was the first football team to ban them in July 2010 and many other football teams have since followed They were banned because of health and saftey reasons especially because it was said that people might not hear any safety announcements

Web accessibility is how easy it is to use the internet for people with disabilities 

This can be different types of disabilities For example websites might have important information in a sound file with somebody reading it out loud which would make it possible for people who are blind or who have trouble seeing to get the information Another way of making a website more accessible would be to remove an image with flashing lights because such images could give some people seizures

Brachiosauridae are a family of sauropod dinosaurs whose members are known as brachiosaurids They were herbivorous quadrupeds with longer forelegs than hind legs As a result there is also some dispute about which animals belong within this family

The largest mounted skeleton in the world is a brachiosaurid the Giraffatitan brancai at the Museum fr Naturkunde in Berlin Germany

Brachiosaurids first evolved in the Middle Jurassic period and died out at the end of the Early Cretaceous period existing for about 60 million years The earliest known brachiosaurid is Lapparentosaurus from the Middle Jurassic of Africa The giant Sauroposeidon from North America was one of the last brachiosaurids existing just before the end of the Early Cretaceous period 

The name brachiosaurid means arm lizard which may sound like a strange name for a four legged animal The family Brachiosauridae was given this name because the dinosaurs in it tended to have longer arms than back legs

Brachiosaurids have been featured in many works of popular culture particulary the type genus Brachiosaurus Brachiosaurus was featured in the 1993 film Jurassic Park as well as the 2000 Disney film Dinosaur The brachiosaurid Astrodon is the state dinosaur of Maryland It was featured in paleontologist Robert T Bakkers novel Raptor Red where it was portrayed as a prey item of the dromaeosaurid Utahraptor

Giraffatitan is a genus of sauropod dinosaurs that lived during the late Jurassic Period about 140 million years ago It was one of the largest animals known to have walked the earth

Giraffatitans were about convert23mftadjon tall and weighed about convert40tlb They had very long necks and looked like giraffes They lived in Tanzania in an area called Tendaguru

It was first named as an African species of Brachiosaurus in 1914 by Werner Janensch because some dinosaurs found in the same area looked like it In 1988 Gregory S Paul said that there were some differences between the Brachiosaurus brancai and the North American Brachiosaurus so he created a subgenus called Brachiosaurus brancai In 1991 George Olshevsky said there were enough differences to make its own genus creating Giraffatitan

An object in grammar is the target of an action and occurs in any sentence with a transitive verb It is an element in the clause which follows the verb as in

These are direct objects The following are indirect objects

The structure of these sentences is where S subject V verb and O object The first object is an indirect object the second is a direct object Notice that in the last example you sent a letter not your son The sentence makes perfect sense without the indirect object

An equivalent sentence to the last example is

Here some grammarians also see son as the indirect objectp720

The subject in grammar is the agent in an active sentence such as Alan kissed Jane

However there is a difficulty The following two sentences are identical in meaning

Only in the first sentence is our children the grammatical subject So there is a difference between the logical subject and the grammatical subjectp996 Also many sentences have no subject for instance

If a sentence does have a subject then the rest of the sentence may be called the predicate 

A frigate is a warship The term has been used for warships of many sizes and roles for a few centuries During the age of sail they were small agile ships that were extensively used in the American War of Independence and later against the British Their main use was shore defense

In the modern day the term Frigate covers a broad range of ships This is primarily for political reasons The generally accepted term is of a warship less that 6 000 dwt and greater that around 2 000 dwt Its primary purpose is usually anti submarine warfare It can also be a long range patrol vessel or in smaller navies an anti air vessel

Voice in grammar is about the way subject and object work in a sentence

The distinction only applies where the verb is transitive since only a transitive verb comes with an objectp 1094 For example We enjoyed the trip is transitive and in active voice The trip was enjoyed by us is transitive and in passive voice She hurried home is not transitive and so has no voice But if she hurried the children home thats transitive and active voice

Transitivity is a term in mathematics

In general in a set if a is related to b and b is related to c then a is related to c

Black widows are spiders Their scientific name is Latrodectus mactans and they share the Latrodectus name with several similar spiders They are shiny black have round abdomens with a red hourglass pattern on its underside They are closely related to another group called Steotoda that contains species that are not dangerous to humans All of the true widow spiders can give bites that are harmful to human beings and may kill children or people who are not in good health

Female widow spiders are rather largehaving a body length of approximately 05 inch The males of the widow spiders are very much smaller than the females 

Both the widow spiders and the Steotoda spiders belong to a larger group that includes very many kinds of spiders that make similar kinds of webs and have the same general body shape But those spiders are not shiny black and often prefer to build their webs in sunny places 

Black widow spiders live in warm places all over the world They like to build their webs in safe places under something like an overturned box sitting on the ground Often they are found under the seats of outdoor toilets They like to be left alone so they rarely come inside places where people live 

Like other spiders Black widows bite for two reasons to kill things to eat and to protect themselves They catch flying insects in their webs and bite them so that they will stop fighting to get free When people put their hands into this spiders web they might get bitten by mistake but usually people get bitten when they squeeze a spider and the spider defends itself Unfortunately for us humans are very sensitive to the venom that the spider gives in its bite The good thing is that Widow spiders will almost always run away if they can If something big hits their web then they will drop straight down to the ground and run away

Black widows eat flies moths and anything else that flies or falls into their webs and that is not big enough to escape 

Armadillidiidae is a family of woodlice a terrestrial crustacean group in the order Isopoda Pill bugs are not insects but are crustaceans Crustaceans are animals with hard shells made from many pieces for protection Pill bugs look like gray pills The pill bugs abdomen has seven segments Pill bugs have flat bodies The pill bug has three basic body parts called the head thorax and abdomen and they can be many sizes The head has eyes and a mouth Pill bugs have two sets of antenna One of the sets is visible to see The thorax holds the legs The abdomen holds the exopods of uropods is attached to some crustaceans abdomen Pillbugs eat rotten vegetables 

The Druze are an Arabic speaking people of the Middle East 

There are more than 500000 Druze About half of them live in the Hauran districts of Syria Most of the rest live in Lebanon and about 40000 live in Israel Some have emigrated to the United States and Canada 

The Druze practice a religion related to Islam and Christianity but more based on philosophy Al Hakim a ruler of Egypt during the 11th century sponsored the religion which was created by Hamza bin Ali The name Druze probably comes from Darazi a preacher who was expelled from the Druze movement because he preached that Al Hakim was literally God 

The Druze in Lebanon had a major political influence and where the rulers of Lebanon before the 1860s after the 1860s they shared the ruling of mount Lebanon with the Maronites and were later considered the 4th major religious sect after independence They played a key role in fighting against the Lebanese Christian right during the early 1980s The Druze ended their fighting against the Lebanese Christian right in late 1990 In 1990 and 1991 they gained representation in Lebanons government in accordance with a 1989 peace agreement

Acacia is a genus of shrub or tree are belonging to the subfamily Mimosoideae of the family Fabaceae first described in Africa by the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus in 1773 Many non Australian species tend to be thorny whereas the majority of Australian Acacias are not 

Acacias are heavily defended against herbivores Different species have different combinations of defences

Products from the Acacia have often been used for medicinal purposes

Various species of acacia yield gum True gum arabic is the product of Acacia senegal abundant in dry tropical West Africa from Senegal to northern Nigeria

Acacia arabica is the gum Arabic tree of India but yields a gum inferior to the true gum Arabic

Horizontal and vertical writing are two ways of writing

Documents around the world have many different ways of writing But there are mainly two ways of writing writing horizontally or vertically There are two kinds of horizontal writing One kind can be read from left to right the other is read from right to left There are two kinds of vertical writing as well from left to right or from right to left Traditionally the countries in the Sinosphere write vertically from right to left When it was necessary to write horizontally they wrote horizontally from right to left When the Western culture began influencing them they began writing horizontally from left to right which is now used widely Today letters that can be written both horizontally and vertically are not common

Most Western languages are written horizontally from left to right but Arabian and Hebrew are written horizontally from right to left Mongol letters are written horizontally from left to right

Long ago people used hieroglyphs Hieroglyphs were very flexible letters They were often written from left to right in the first line and then right to left in the second line and so on This is called boustrophedon

Mimosoideae is a subfamily of the flowering plant family Fabaceae Members of this family usually have flowers with small petals and many stamens 

Some classification systems for example the Cronquist system treat Fabaceae in a narrow sense raising Mimosoideae to the rank of family as Mimosaceae The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group treats Fabaceae in the broad sense

The impressionist movement in music was a movement in European classical music It was mostly in France It began in the late nineteenth century and ended in the middle of the Twentieth Century There were two very famous composers of this movement Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel Debussy actually did not like the term Impressionist in his works

Neoclassicism in music was popular in the twentieth century Mostly between the two World Wars This kind of music is when composers try to come back to beautiful ways with the broadly defined way of classicism namely order balance clarity economy and emotions Neoclassicism had two distinct national lines of development They were French and German Neoclassicsim was a beautiful trend rather than a movement Many composers normally do not think of themselves as neoclassicists But some really do have some elements of the style

Paul Marie Theodore Vincent dIndy was a French composer and music teacher Born in Paris he was encouraged to learn music by his uncle who had studied with Csar Franck DIndy later also studied with Franck at the Paris Conservatoire He liked the music of Lizst Beethoven and Wagner He went to the first performance of Wagners Ring at Bayreuth in 1876 He organized performances of works by Rameau and Monteverdi whose work had been mostly forgotten He was a very conservative in his views on music and after his proposed changes to the Conservatoire were ignored he set up his own music school the Schola Cantorum in 1894

He wrote a large number of musical compositions including operas overtures symphonies choral works piano works string sextets string quartets folk song arrangements and a cello sonata One of his well known works is the Symphonie sur un Chant Montagnard Franais 

He also wrote books including a biography of Csar Franck and a book on how to write music

Edgard Victor Achille Charles Varse whose name was also spelled Edgar Varse was a French composer who spent the greater part of his career in the United States

Conservapedia is a wiki designed for people who are conservative Christians It was created by Andrew Schlafly Conservapedia is a reaction to what its creators see as a liberal point of view in Wikipedia Conservapedia has articles on many things but most of the site is about politics and religion It also has lectures and other materials for students and classes taught by Mr Schlafly for free All articles are written from a conservative point of view dominant in the United States of America Conservapedia has some different ideas on community They have Administrators who have the most power Users cannot edit at nighttime in the US upload images or do other things they could do at most wikis Users are granted these rights and can also earn the right to block other users

Conservapedia was founded by lawyer Andrew Schlafly because of what he felt was liberal bias in Wikipedia He did this with his homeschooled World History class after one of his students used Common Era dating methods instead of his preferred Anno Domini ones

Unlike Wikipedia anonymous people are not allowed to contribute to Conservapedia They have to create accounts that should be using part of their real names Edits should follow the sites conservative Christian point of view Administrators control every aspect of the site and have the final say in editorial authority People who are called vandals often come to Conservapedia to mess up the pages because they do not agree with the sites point of view People are often unfairly banned for making minor mistakes

Conservapedia has a part of the site where editors rewrite the Bible to remove liberal bias from modern versions They claim that the New International Version of the Bible is written at the seventh grade level and that it has politically correct language Critics say that it is not good to rewrite the Bible and say it was bad for them to remove Jesus prayer in Luke 2334 and the adulteress story

Schlafly got into an argument with Michigan State University researcher Richard Lenski over his twenty year experiment with ecoli samples he used to show evolution occurring Schlafly mailed Lenski asking for the results Lenski responded by redirecting Schlafly to his paper on the subject Schlafly asked for the evidence and Lenski refused to hand him the samples since he did not have the expertise Conservapedians got in a campaign criticizing Lenski

Critics use this as a way to show how ignorant they think Conservapedia is

Conservapedia has had some bad reactions from people who think that it is untrue It has also been criticized for supporting some ideas such as creationism

A site called RationalWiki was created to criticize Conservapedia and some editors of that site decided that they wanted to vandalize or destroy Conservapedia

Two other sites A Storehouse of Knowledge and Ameriwiki were created as alternatives to Conservapedia

A text grammar is the study of texts above the level of the sentence It shows how texts are put together so as to convey ideas facts messages and fiction 

A similar term is discourse analysis Both are mostly concerned with natural language use discourse analysis would include spoken language Speech is also the parent of rhetoric the ancient study of persuasive speaking In a similar way literary criticism parallels text grammar because both concentrate on the printed word A text grammar approach puts emphasis on the linguistic structure of a text rather than its cultural or symbolic meaning

A text is a coherent body of sentences Coherent means they are linked by a consistent theme The text ends when completion is signalled For example when a problem introduced at the start is solved or when a promised discussion has reached a conclusion 

Each text focuses on certain things If text are grouped by what they are doing then there are five basic text types

Many texts of course can and do have a mixture of two or more of these types 

Discourse analysis is a subject which studies a text or a conversation This is a subject in linguistics which does not study sentences like in syntax but the entire text or conversation The text or conversation is known as discourse Discourse analyst prefer to use real life discourse in their studies rather than invented sentences like in traditional linguistics This way of studying real life discourse is called corpus linguistics 

Discourse analysis is related to text linguistics However text linguistics studies how discourse is structured so that they are connected Discourse analysis studies this and also how the discourse is connected to the context This context includes who the people talking or writing are the social and cultural context Also it studies the way mode which is the way the language is represented influences discourse Discourse analysis is also interested in the genre of the discourse 

Discourse analysis is studied not only in linguistics but also in sociology anthropology psychology communication studies and translation studies

Aphaenogaster kimberleyensis is a species of ant It has been found and described by Shattuck S O in 2008

Aphaenogaster is a genus of myrmicine ants Almost 200 species have been described Also 11 fossil species are known They live worldwide except from South America and Southern Africa 

They are often confused with Pheidole or Pheidologeton These two have major and minor workers while Aphaenogaster has only a single worker caste Pheidole has a 3 segmented club on its antenna But Aphaenogaster has four segments and a larger body size Pheidologeton has a 11 segmented antenna while the antenna in Aphaenogaster is 12 segmented

They make very thick easily seen nests with many big entrances in a small place These entrances can have diameters of up to 4 cm and are up to 30 cm deep This resulted in their common name funnel ants These nests can be a bad problem for golfers or on pastures and unsealed airstrips because the fragile ground easily breaks under pressure

Aphaenogaster gets most of its food from tended aphids on the roots of plants This explains that they are not commonly seen out of their tunnels The funnel shaped openings could play a role in trapping arthropods which are also eaten

Although these ants are not aggressive they will bite when their nest is disturbed

Der Wanderer is the name of a Lied composed by Franz Schubert in October 1816 for voice and piano  The words are taken from a German poem by Georg Philipp Schmidt von Lbeck The lied is set in the key of C sharp minor with the tempo marking sehr langsam and the time signature alla breve The piece has a total of 72 measures Schubert wrote another lied entitled Der Wanderer it is numbered D649

The song begins with a recitative describing the setting mountains a steaming valley the roaring sea The wanderer is strolling quietly unhappily and asks sighing the question where

The next section consisting of 8 bars of a slow melody sung in pianissimo describes the feelings of the wanderer He feels that he is a stranger everywhere This 8 bar section was later used by Schubert as theme for the second movement of the Wanderer Fantasy

Next the music shifts to the key of E major the tempo increases and the time signature changes to 68 The wanderer asks where are you my beloved land This place the wanderer longs for is described as green with hope the land where my roses bloom my friends stroll my dead rise and finally the land which speaks my language Oh land where are you Towards the end of this section the music gets quite animated and forms the climax of the song

Finally the music returns to the original minor key and slow tempo After quoting the question where from the opening the song closes with a ghostly breath finally answering the question There where you are not there is happiness The song closes in the key of E major

Life Before Life is a book written by psychiatrist Jim B Tucker It presents an overview of more than 40 years of reincarnation research at the University of Virginia into childrens reports of past life memories 

The book suggests that consciousness can be considered separately from the brain which provides a basis for claims of reincarnation Life Before Life has been translated into ten languages and the foreword to the book is written by Ian Stevenson 

Ian Stevenson MD was a Canadian professor of psychiatry He worked at the University of Virginia in the area of parapsychology 

Stevenson thought that the idea of reincarnation might help modern medicine better understand aspects of human behavior and development He traveled a lot over a period of 40 years to investigate 3000 childhood cases that suggested to him the possibility of past lives Stevenson saw reincarnation as the survival of the personality after death although he never suggested a physical process by which a personality might survive death 

Stevensons research was the subject of Jim B Tuckers Life Before Life

Stevenson found that the best evidence supporting the belief in reincarnation comes from the cases of young children who typically between the ages of 2 and 5 make statements about a previous life they claim to have had before being born Their statements are often accompanied by behaviour that is unusual for their family but appropriate for the life that the child claims to remember There is often a forgetting of the imaged memories between the ages of 5 and 8 a high incidence of violent death claimed in the claimed previous life and mention of the mode of death by the subject

Some 35 per cent of the subjects have birthmarks or birth defects which often correspond to injuries or illness experienced by the deceased person who the subject remembers Medical documents have confirmed this correspondence in more than forty cases

Ian Stevenson authored or co authored more than a dozen books Stevenson died in 2007 and many of these books are mentioned in his obituaries in the British Medical Journal New York Times and the Washington Post

Parapsychology is the study of psychic phenomona These phenomona involve the exchange of information between a person and their environment without the use of the five senses They include extrasensory perception influence of mind on matter anomalous experiences and apparitions Such things have been reported for a very long time

In 2005 Nobel Laureate Brian Josephson said that many scientists are not yet swayed by the evidence for parapsychology and the paranormal Josephson contends that some scientists feel uncomfortable about ideas such as telepathy and that their emotions sometimes get in the way when making evaluations

Handedness is the preference for using either the left or the right side of the body for certain things People are described as left handed or right handed when they prefer to write with their left or their right hand They may prefer the use of certain hands for certain tasks

The scientific name for handedness is laterisation Laterisation is not only found in humans it is found in many kinds of animals

Laterisation is caused because one side of the brain is stronger than the other The left side of the brain controls the right side of the body and the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body

Until fairly recently most scientists thought that the reason that humans preferred the left or right sides of their body was because they could speak Language is controlled by the left side of the brain so they thought there was a connection between language and laterisation 

The scientists changed their minds when they found that it was not just humans who have laterisation  Many animals have it too For example elephants often have preferences for whether they swing their trunks to the left or the right Honeybees have right antennas that are more sensitive to smells Parrots can be left or right footed and some dont mind Animals as different as chickens and minnows like to look for food with one eye and look out for predators with the other This seems to help them to do two things at once

The Andromeda Galaxy is the nearest big galaxy to the Milky Way our galaxy Andromeda is sometimes called M31 or NGC 324 by astronomers It is about 25 million light years away from us 

Andromeda is the largest galaxy of the Local Group which consists of the Andromeda Galaxy the Milky Way Galaxy the Triangulum Galaxy and about 30 other smaller galaxies Although the largest Andromeda may not be the most massive Recent findings suggest that the Milky Way contains more dark matter and may be the most massive in the grouping 

The 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope revealed that M31 contains a trillion stars This is more than the number of stars in our own galaxy which is estimated to be c 200 400 billion

Andromeda is estimated to be 71e11 solar masses In comparison a 2009 study estimated that the Milky Way and Andromeda are about equal in mass while a 2006 study put the mass of the Milky Way at 80 of the mass of Andromeda 

At an apparent magnitude of 34 the Andromeda Galaxy is notable for being one of the brightest Messier objects making it visible to the naked eye on moonless nights even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution Although it appears more than six times as wide as the full Moon when photographed through a larger telescope only the brighter central region is visible to the naked eye Being both large and bright it is one of the farthest objects that can be seen without a telescope or binoculars

The Andromeda Galaxy is approaching the Milky Way at about 100 to 140 kilometres per second so it is one of the few blue shifted galaxies The Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way are thus expected to collide in perhaps 45 billion years A likely outcome of the collision is that the galaxies will merge to form a giant elliptical galaxy Such events are frequent among the galaxies in galaxy groups

As a form of entertainment the mechanical bull often includes a saddle and often a model of the head of a bull complete with horns  One of the earliest uses as a form of entertainment was at Bertrand Island Amusement Park in New Jersey where a mechanical bucking bronco ride was introduced in the 1930s under the name of Ride Em Cowboy

The commercial use of mechanical bulls gained popular appeal with the release of the 1980 movie Urban Cowboy In this movie John Travolta and Debra Winger showed the riding a mechanical bull The mechanical bull used in this movie was the El Toro brand of mechanical bull This brand of mechanical bull is still being made but does not carry the same safety features that are available on more current models Mechanical bulls can also be seen in the films Stir Crazy and Charlies Angels Full Throttle In the movie Barnyard in the night barn a Mechanical Man is seen

In the television show Strangers with Candy Jerri Blanks physical education class is uses mechanical bull riding

A bucking bronco was originally a cowboy term for a horse that jumps about with stiff knees and an arched back

The Suda is somewhere between a grammatical dictionary and an encyclopedia in the modern sense It explains the source derivation and meaning of words according to the philology of its period There is nothing especially important about this aspect of the work It is the articles on literary history that are valuable These entries supply details and quotations from authors whose works are otherwise lost 

This lexicon represents a convenient work of reference for persons who played a part in political ecclesiastical and literary history in the East down to the tenth century The chief source for this is the encyclopedia of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus and for Roman history the excerpts of John of Antioch

The work deals with biblical as well as pagan subjects from which it is inferred that the writer was a Christian A prefatory note gives a list of dictionaries from which the lexical portion was compiled together with the names of their authors The work is uncritical and probably much added to and the value of the articles is very unequal Nevertheless it contains much information on ancient history and life

The Souda has a near contemporaneous Islamic parallel the Kitab al Fehrest of Ibn al Nadim

The lexicon is arranged alphabetically with some slight deviations The letters follow phonetically in order of sound The system is not difficult to learn and remember but in some modern editions the work is rearranged alphabetically

An Out of Body Experience is a big feeling of not being where your body is It hardly ever happens and does not last very long It feels like you can see and hear and move to different places or even fly but all the time your body is sleeping in bed It feels very strange

OBEs happen most when you are waking up or going to sleep They can happen if you nearly die too That kind of OBE is a Near Death Experience or NDE Some people get OBEs during too much marathon running or mountain climbing

OBEs often work the same way When they do they are classical OBEs

Some people say they have phasing OBEs too They just stop noticing the world remember the easy feeling and start seeing There is no sleep paralysis so they can sometimes talk about it at the same time

Most people can see two kinds of place when they have an OBE Robert Monroe called them Locale I and Locale II but some people call them the etheric plane and the astral plane

Locale 1 places look like ordinary places in the world You might see your bedroom or sleeping body in Locale I Locale II places are more like dream worlds or heavens

Some people think OBEs are just dreams but other people say OBEs dont feel like that Some people think that when you have an OBE youre like a ghost and the things you see are real People who think that sometimes call them astral projections Some scientists like Sam Parnia are doing tests with hidden pictures in hospitals to see if ill people really can see them when they have NDEs

Implication is a grammatical concept To imply is to suggest something is true without actually saying it Examples

Implication is one of a pair of words which go together When you realise the meaning of the second sentence and protest I have never beaten her you have made an inference Here is the rule

Inference always comes after an implication I imply then you infer 

An implication is always verbal but inferring is not always verbal A non verbal response might show the indirect message had been accurately interpreted by the receiver Example I hate you may contain unspoken implications according to circumstance and tone of voice Between two lovers it might mean

Nonverbal communication is the process of sending and receiving wordless messages Language is not the only source of communication there are other means Much nonverbal communication is unconscious it happens without thinking about it

NVC can be communicated through gestures and touch by body language or posture by facial expression and eye contact NVC can be communicated through objects such as clothing and hairstyles Dance is also a type of nonverbal communication 

Speech contains nonverbal elements known as paralanguage including voice quality emotion and speaking style as well as prosodic features such as rhythm intonation and stress Likewise written texts have nonverbal elements such as handwriting style spatial arrangement of words or the use of emoticons such as 

Nonverbal communication has three main aspects the situation where it takes place the communicators and their behavior during the interactionp7

Verbal means the use of words Thus vocal sounds that are not considered to be words such as a grunt or singing a wordless note are nonverbal Sign languages and writing are understood as verbal communication as both make use of words although like speech paralinguistic elements do occur alongside nonverbal messages Nonverbal communication can occur through any sensory channel sight sound smell touch or taste NVC is important because When we speak our attention is focused on words rather than body language But our judgement includes both An audience is simultaneously processing both verbal and nonverbal cues Body movements are not usually positive or negative in and of themselves rather the situation and the message will determine the appraisalp4 

Argyle put forward the idea that spoken language is mainly used for communicating information about external events and non verbal codes are used in interpersonal relationships According to Argyle there are five primary functions of nonverbal bodily behavior in human communication

Paralanguage is the study of nonverbal cues of the voice Various acoustic properties of speech such as tone pitch and accent collectively known as prosody can all give off nonverbal cues Paralanguage may change the meaning of words

The linguist George L Trager developed a classification system which consists of the voice set voice qualities and vocalization

Clothes and fashion generally send messages We judge others by what we see at least when we first meet them Fashion is a reflection of the time and place The styles show as much about history and the time period as any history book Clothes reflect on what people think and how they live Fashion is a nonverbal statement It reflects our time our beliefs and sometimes our religion

Body language means how your body is held the stance It tends to show your attitude to what is going on round you Others pick up the signs in a flash 

Eye contact can indicate interest attention and involvementp10 Gaze includes looking while talking looking while listening amount of gaze and frequency of glances patterns of fixation pupil dilation and blink ratep153

Showing strong emotions is powerful communication which is immediately understood Many of the signals are the same in all cultures as Darwin showed Examples of strong emotions shown visually are

These are listed in order of clarity No one mistakes anger or fear but more subtle emotions may sometimes be missed by the onlooker

Touch is classic nonverbal communication It is perhaps the most intimate thing one person can do to another What it means depends on the context Here is a short list of what we may do when we touch another person

Most of the arts are forms of non verbal communication

In physics pair production is what happens when a photon interacts with the nucleus of an atom instead of the electron like in lower level x ray interactions The photon gives its energy to the nucleus and then creates a pair of positively and negatively charged electrons The positive electron ionizes until it combines with a free electron The two photons scatter in opposite directions

The probability of pair production is proportional to the energy of the incoming photon and is affected by the materials atomic number Pair production usually happens with energy levels over 25 MeV Pair production happens sometimes in radiation therapy treatments with high energy photon beams

Sexual selection is a special kind of natural selection It is a theory of Charles Darwin that certain traits can be explained by competition within a species 

Darwin defined sexual selection as the effects of the struggle between the individuals of one sex generally the males for the possession of the other sex It is usually males who fight each other Traits selected by male combat are called secondary sexual characteristics and sometimes referred to as weapons Traits selected by mate choice are called ornaments

Females often prefer to mate with males with external ornamentsexaggerated features of morphology Genes that enable males to develop impressive ornaments or fighting ability may simply show off greater disease resistance or a more efficient metabolismfeatures that also benefit females This idea is known as the good genes hypothesis Sexual selection is still being researched and discussed today

Ernst Mayr said

Today biologists would say that certain evolutionary traits can be explained by competition between members of the same species Competition can be before or after sexual intercourse 

Finally sexual conflict is said to occur between breeding partners sometimes leading to an evolutionary arms race between males and females This is based on the simple fact that the interests of males and females in reproduction are fundamentally different Males their interest is to mate with a large number of completely faithful females thus spreading their genes widely in the population Females Their interest is to mate with a large number of fit males thus producing a large number of fit and varied offspring92

Female mating preferences are widely recognized as being responsible for the rapid and divergent evolution of male secondary sexual traits Females of many animal species prefer to mate with males with external ornaments exaggerated features such as elaborate sex organs Alternatively genes that enable males to develop impressive ornaments or fighting ability may simply show off greater disease resistance or a more efficient metabolism These features would be likely to be inherited by offspring

Blood atonement was a doctrine of the Mormon Church It was first preached by Brigham Young in the 1850s though Joseph Smith may have thought of it first At one time most Mormons believed it but now only some fundamentalists do It was the belief that some things people do are so bad they have to be atoned by being killed This is sometimes called blood for blood punishment because it was used to punish murder However it was also sometimes used for non violent crimes such as denying or leaving the church and marrying someone of a different race The blood atonement idea led to firing squads being allowed in Utah for many years It also may have led to the Mountain Meadows Massacre where Mormons killed some emigrants from Arkansas





John Michael Wright was a British portrait painter in the Baroque style 

Wright was taught in Edinburgh by the Scots painter George Jamesone He became a famous artist and scholar during his long journey in Rome There he entered the Accademia di San Luca and came to know some of the most important artists of his time He was hired by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria the governor of the Spanish Netherlands in 1655 His job was to find artworks in Oliver Cromwells England in 1655 

He settled in England from 1656 He served there as a court painter before and after the English Restoration A Roman Catholic he was favoured by the Stuart court Hired by both Charles II and James II he saw many of the political experiences of the era In the last years of the Stuart rule he went back to Rome as part of an embassy to Pope Innocent XI

Today Wright is seen as one of the most important British painters of his time He is important mostly because of the special realism he used in his portraits Perhaps because of his unusual experiences he was favoured by people of the highest level of society This was surprising in an age in which foreign artists were usually more liked Wrights paintings of royalty and aristocracy are in the collections of many great galleries today

John Michael Wright who would later sign himself Anglus or Scotus is of uncertain origin The diarist John Evelyn called him a Scotsman Horace Walpole and his later biographer Verne agreed with this 

But in 1700 Thomas Hearne claimed that Wright was born in Shoe Lane London He added that after Wright became a Roman Catholic when he was an adolescent he was taken to Scotland by a priest A baptismal record dated 25 May 1617 for a Mighell Wryghtt son of James Wright described as a tailor and a citizen of London in London seems to agree with this claim

Xenophanes of Colophon c570 c475 BC was a Greek philosopher poet and social and religious critic

Our knowledge of his views comes from fragments of his poetry surviving as quotations by later Greek writers To judge from these his poetry criticized and satirized a wide range of ideas This included Homer and Hesiod the belief in the pantheon of anthropomorphic gods and the Greeks veneration of broken wikt linkathleticismathleticism He is the earliest Greek poet who claims explicitly to be writing for future generations creating fame that will reach all of Greece and never die while the Greek kind of songs survives

Xenophanes surviving writings display a skepticism that became more commonly expressed during the 4th century BC He satirized the polytheistic beliefs of earlier Greek poets and of his own contemporaries Homer and Hesiod one fragment states have attributed to the gods all sorts of things that are matters of reproach and censure among men theft adultery and mutual deception Sextus Empiricus reported that such ideas were savored by Christian apologists Xenophanes is quoted memorably in Clement of Alexandria arguing against the conception of gods as fundamentally anthropomorphic But if cattle and horses and lions had handsor could paint with their hands and create works such as men dohorses like horses and cattle like cattlealso would depict the gods shapes and make their bodiesof such a sort as the form they themselves haveEthiopians say that their gods are snubnosed and blackThracians that they are pale and red haired

On the Origin of Species is the famous book by Charles Darwin It gave evidence for evolution and suggested what had caused evolution to happen 

Its full title was On the origin of species by means of natural selection or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life 

It was published by John Murray in London in 1859 It was translated into many languages and has been in print ever since The title since the 6th edition of 1872 has been The Origin of Species This is the most important single book in the biological sciences and its main ideas are well supported by modern research

Darwins book did two things First it provided a great deal of evidence that evolution has taken place Second it proposed a theory to explain how evolution works That theory is natural selection Evolution by natural selection is the key to understanding biology and the diversity of life on Earth

Darwins ideas on the connection between natural selection and inheritance were unclear mainly because the process of genetic inheritance was unknown at that time This was solved in the mid 20th century by the modern evolutionary synthesis which showed that Gregor Mendels genetics was compatible with evolution in small steps Darwin made almost no mention of the evolution of the human race though most of the controversy raged around this topic Darwin eventually published The Descent of Man in 1871

The Origin was a serious blow to all who interpreted the Bible literally However even in 1860 there were many Christians who thought some of the Old Testament could not be literally true Even the early Church Fathers had not interpreted Genesis literallyp323 Today both the Anglican and Catholic churches hold that evolution is not inconsistent with their beliefs

The Origin marked a big step in the history of science Before it religious leaders often gave their opinions on science after though it took time science increasingly became the business of professional scientists Darwins friend Thomas Henry Huxley devoted many years to supporting Darwin and opposing any interference of religion in science

All aspects of biology have been affected by evolution Before Darwin most biology was natural history done by dedicated amateurs After Darwin most biology was done by professionals trained in modern techniques The book helped this change by providing evolution as the explanation of how living things came to be as they are 

Darwins aims were twofold to show that species had not been separately created and to show that natural selection had been the chief agent of change 

Many readers were already familiar with the idea of evolution from a book published anonymously in 1844 Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation In his introduction Darwin ridicules that work as failing to provide a mechanism 

The first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature caused by the struggle for existence is analogous to the selection of variations under domestication

Darwin presents supporting facts drawn from many disciplines The idea was to show that his theory could explain a myriad of observations from many fields of natural history that were inexplicable if species had been individually created

There were six editions of the Origin during Darwins life The second in 1860 was almost the same as the first The sixth edition bore the title The origin of species

There were many changes in the text in later editions In the fifth edition of 1869 Darwin used Herbert Spencers phrase survival of the fittest for the first time in the heading of chapter 4 

In the sixth and last edition Darwin uses the word evolution for the first time in this book There is a new chapter 7 inserted

The Origin was translated during Darwins lifetime into Danish Dutch French German Hungarian Italian Polish Serbian Spanish and Swedish and into 18 more languages since Translations into some languages such as French and German were done more than once

There are some reference works which help scholars to do research on the Origin

Hello all we should really thinking about out most wanted list before my replacements

Should we not replace these by better candidates  We do have very limited resources I think most authors are probably not interested in creatingreading about such articles I assume the most wanted list is bot created We should therefore cut down on the references and get the list re created Thoughts Eptalon 1318 30 May 2010

Just another idea We currently have 10 most wanted entries and currently 6 top level knowledge groups

This would prevent a situation like now where one subject area is dominating The more variety we have the more likely well see the articles getting created  Eptalon 1640 30 May 2010

Where we have options is how articles are picked

I think its important for us to pick articles from various topics To actually pick the articles I think this last option is probably the best since it represents the articles that are actually most likely to be read rather than the ones currently most linked to on our wiki Thoughts EhJJTALK 1644 30 May 2010

Personally I think we should focus less on this sort of thingthe old way was a simple way that didnt require administration for the most part which is why it was ok to do it But once we start pulling people away from actual editing to decide on these sorts of things they become less valuable Id rather see the most wanted list disappear completely than to be made even more complex and time consumming DJSasso 1837 2 June 2010 Frankly Ive always thought that each article listed in the knowledge groups on our main page should be VGAs Its a bit of a sad situation that most have major issues fr33kman 0344 7 June 2010

If it works well on enwp are we going to adopt it I dont think we have much use for Level 2 flagged protection but I think for this wiki Level 1 would serve excellently as an alternative to semi protection altogether Because it is so flexible in allowing IP edits but not letting vandalism show up straight away it would encourage more editing of this wiki Also reviewing it would just be an easy extension of RC patrol which many of us do anyway Any malicious IP vandalises Justin Bieber or something just nuke with no change to the reader What do you think Is it too much extra work Soniatalken 1037 13 June 2010

Canaanites were a people mentioned in the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament Most of their land called Canaan later became known as Israel 

The Canaanites settled in the region about 2000 BCE They were the main inhabitants until about 1200 BC The Bible says that the Israelites conquered Canaan at that time However archaeology and some parts of the Bible suggest that the Israelites only gradually became the areas main people Archaeology also suggests that many Canaanite cities were destroyed by the Sea Peoples or Philistines in the 1100s BCE The Sea Peoples may have sailed to Canaan from the area around the Aegean Sea 

The Canaanites were a Semitic people related to the Phoenicians Amorites Assyrians and Israelites The Canaanites had a developed civilization Their main political group was the city state In a city stae a king ruled a city or town and the villages and land around it The Bible mentions a number of Canaanite tribes

Ramesses II was the greatest Pharoah of Ancient Egypt He was the third Pharaoh of the Nineteenth dynasty His successors and later Egyptians called him the Great Ancestor

When he was 14 Ramesses was appointed successor by his father Seti I He ruled Egypt from 1279 BC to 1213 BCp165 This is a total of 66 years and 2 months It is likely that he died in his 90th or 91st year On his death he was buried in a tomb in the Valley of the Kings his body was later moved to a royal cache where it was discovered in 1881 It is now on display in the Cairo Museum

Ramesses II led several expeditions north into the lands east of the Mediterranean He also led expeditions to the south into Nubia

The early part of his reign was focused on building cities temples and monuments He established the city of Pi Ramesses in the Nile Delta as his new capital and main base for his campaigns in Syria

Early in his life Ramesses went on campaigns to get land back from Nubian and Hittite hands and to secure Egypts borders He also stopped Nubian revolts and ran a campaign in Libya During Ramessess reign the Egyptian army may have included about 100000 men a force that he used to strengthen Egyptian influence

In his second year Ramesses defeated the Sherden sea pirates They were causing problems along Egypts Mediterranean coast by attacking cargo laden vessels on the sea routes to Egyptp250 Ramesses posted troops and ships at strategic points along the coast and allowed the pirates to attack their prey He then caught them by surprise in a sea battle capturing them all in a single actionp53 A stele says they came in their war ships from the midst of the sea and none were able to stand before them Shortly afterwards Sherden are seen in the Pharaohs body guard with their horned helmets round shields and the great Naue II swords

The Hittite Mursili III fled to Egypt after he failed to take his uncles throne The uncle Hattusili III demanded that Ramesses extradite his nephew back to Hattip74

This caused a crisis between Egypt and Hatti when Ramesses said he did not know where Mursili was The two empires came close to war Eventually in the twenty first year of his reign Ramesses decided to make an agreement with Hattusili III to end the conflict The document they agreed is the earliest known peace treaty in world historyp256

The peace treaty was recorded in two versions one in Egyptian hieroglyphs the other in Akkadian using cuneiform script both versions survive Such dual language recording is common to many treaties This treaty differs from others in that the two language versions are differently worded Although the majority of the text is identical the Hittite version claims that the Egyptians came suing for peace while the Egyptian version claims the reversep7379 6264 The treaty was given to the Egyptians in the form of a silver plaque This pocket book version was taken back to Egypt and a copy carved into the Temple of Karnak

The most important and famous of Ramesses Queen consorts was discovered in 1904 The tomb of Nefertari is extremely important because its magnificent wall painting is regarded as one of the greatest examples of ancient Egyptian art

The Governor of New South Wales is the oldest political office Australia Captain Arthur Phillip became the first Governor of New South Wales on 7 February 1788 The Colony of New South Wales was the first British settlement in Australia The first governors had almost autocratic powers due to the distance from and poor communications with Great Britain In 1824 the New South Wales Legislative Council Australias first legislature was appointed to help the governor

Between 1850 and 1861 the Governor of New South Wales was also called the Governor General All letters between the Australian colonies and the British Government were meant to go through the Governor General The other colonies had Lieutenant Governors As they became independent South Australia in 1836 Tasmania January 1855 and Victoria May 1855 replaced their Lieutenant Governors with Governors Sir William Denison kept the title of Governor General until his retirement

The Governor acts on the advice of the head of the elected government the Premier of New South Wales The Governor does have power of the Crown and has the right to dismiss the Premier This power was last used in 1932 when Sir Philip Game dismissed Jack Lang

If the Governor dies resigns or is absent their duties are carried out by the Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales

The Governor of New South Wales used Government House as a home office and official reception space until 1996 The Governors office is now in the historic Chief Secretarys Building at 121 Macquarie Street

The first Australian born Governor of New South Wales was Lieutenant General Sir John Northcott in 1946 All governors since then have been Australian born except for Gordon Samuels who was born in the United Kingdom but came to Australia at an early age Northcotts successor Lieutenant General Sir Eric Woodward was the first born in New South Wales

Tarbosaurus was a large carnivorous theropod dinosaur from Asia especially Mongolia and China It was a tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur that flourished between 70 and 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period

Tarbosaurus lived in a humid floodplain criss crossed by river channels In this environment it was a predator at the top of the food chain probably preying on other large dinosaurs like the hadrosaur Saurolophus or the sauropod Nemegtosaurus  

Like its close North American relative Tyrannosaurus rex it had a large head and powerful jaws but was not top heavy Its huge skull was comparatively thin and light with large air pockets Many of its bones were hollow making them strong but light so they did not add excessive weight to this large predator Its forlimbs were small with two fingers as with its larger relative The small two fingered front limb is absolutely distinctive of tyrannosaurids

The three toed hind limbs were long and thick supporting the body in a bipedal posture The long heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso and placed the center of gravity over the hips

Its skull was similar to that of Tyrannosaurus but more rigid Also because its skull was not so broad at the back it did not have binocular vision like Tyrannosaurus

Some scientists have hypothesized that the more rigid skull of Tarbosaurus was an adaptation to hunting the massive sauropods found in the location which did not exist in most of North America during the later Cretaceous 

Torosaurus was a large quadrupedal plant eating dinosaur with three horns on its large head Torosaurus hatched from eggs and may have lived in herds

Torosaurus lived during the Upper Cretaceous about 70 65 million years ago in what is now western North America 

Dung beetles are beetles that feed partly or exclusively on the faeces of mammals This beetle can also be referred to as the scarab beetle All of these species belong to the superfamily Scarabaeoidea and most of them to the family Scarabaeidae 

There are dung feeding beetles which belong to other families such as the Geotrupidae The subfamily Scarabaeinae alone has more than 5000 species

Many dung beetles known as rollers are noted for rolling dung into spherical balls which are used as a food source or brooding chambers Other dung beetles known as tunnelers bury the dung wherever they find it A third group the dwellers neither roll nor burrow they simply live in manure They are often attracted by the dung burrowing owls collect

Dung beetles live in many different habitats including desert farmland forest and grasslands They do not prefer extremely cold or dry weather They are found on all continents except Antarctica

Dung beetles eat dung excreted by herbivores and omnivores and prefer that produced by the former Many of them also feed on mushrooms and decaying leaves and fruits One type living in South America Deltochilum valgum is a carnivore preying upon millipedes Those that eat dung do not need to eat or drink anything else because the dung provides all the necessary nutrients 

Most dung beetles search for dung using their sensitive sense of smell Some of the smaller species simply attach themselves to the dung providers to wait for their reward After capturing the dung a dung beetle will roll it following a straight line despite all obstacles Sometimes dung beetles will try to steal the dung ball from another beetle so the dung beetles have to move rapidly away from a dung pile once they have rolled their ball to prevent it from being stolen Dung beetles can roll up to 50 times their weight Male Onthophagus taurus beetles can pull 1141 times their own body weight the equivalent of an average person pulling six double decker buses full of people In 2003 researchers found one species of dung beetle navigates by using polarization patterns in moonlight The discovery is the first proof any animal can use polarized moonlight for orientation 

The rollers roll and bury a dung ball either for food storage or to make a brooding ball In the latter case two beetles one male and one female will be seen around the dung ball during the rolling process Usually it is the male that rolls the ball with the female hitch hiking or simply following behind In some cases the male and the female roll together When a spot with soft soil is found they stop and bury the dung ball They will then mate underground After the mating both or one of them will prepare the brooding ball When the ball is finished the female lays eggs inside it Some species do not leave after this stage but remain to safeguard their offspring  

The dung beetle goes through a complete metamorphosis The larvae live in brood balls made with dung prepared by their parents During the larval stage the grub feeds on the dung surrounding it

The behavior of the beetles was much misunderstood until the studies of Jean Henri Fabre Fabre corrected the myth that a dung beetle would seek aid from other dung beetles when confronted by obstacles By painstaking observations and experiments he found the seeming helpers were in fact robbers awaiting an opportunity to steal the rollers food source

Bombardier beetles are ground beetles in the family Carabidae There are more than 500 species which are notable for their defence mechanism Most of them are found in rainforests

When disturbed the beetle squirts a poisonous chemical spray from special glands in its abdomen The ejection makes a popping sound

A bombardier beetle produces and stores two chemical compounds which react with each other hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide 

When threatened the beetle contracts muscles that force the two reactants through tubes into a mixing chamber containing water and enzymes The reactants undergo a violent chemical reaction which gives off heat This raises the temperature to near the boiling point of water

The beetle swivels the tip of its abdomen around and shoots a spray of boiling hot poisonous chemicals at its attacker

Glomerular filtration rate is a test used by physicians and other medical professionals to see if the kidneys are working correctly In basic terms it is a measurement of how much liquid and waste is passing from the blood through the tiny filters in the kidney called the glomeruli and out into the urine during each minute The test measures how much creatinine is in the blood This shows how well the kidneys are performing In a normal healthy person the GFR stays close to the same value all of the time The test is done by taking blood from a person and sending it to a laboratory Normal values are between 90mlmin and 110mlmin A value below 60mlminute means the person has chronic renal disease and a value below 15mlminute means the persons kidneys have stopped working 

Measurement of the GFR can be very helpful to medical professionals It helps them decide if a person has a disease of the kidneys or not A normal value for GFR is between 90 110mlmin This will normally go down in older people It will also go down in people with kidney disease As well as helping a medical professional diagnose a kidney disease the GFR is also used to monitor the progress of a disease

The test begins by taking blood from a persons veins The most common places are the vein in the elbow and the veins on the back of the hands People usually feel a sharp stinging pain when the needle enters their skin After the blood is drawn out it is sent to a medical laboratory where a laboratory technician calculates the GFR It is possible to calculate an exact value for the GFR but this is rarely done any more Most of the time the value is estimated The basis for this estimate is a chemical in the blood called creatinine The calculation may also include things such as gender age height weight and race Getting an exact measurement needs more tests and special equipment Doctors now normally use the estimated GFR with signs symptoms and the medical history given by the patient to come to a diagnosis A final diagnosis of kidney disease may sometimes be made by a pathologist using tests such as a kidney biopsy 

There are some slight risks when this test is done These include too much bleeding from the needle entering the skin and vein blood collecting under the skin feeling faint and infection from the skin being pierced by the needle

There are many functions that make up the GFR These include nitrogen based waste sodium water potassium phosphate and some medicines dissolved in the plasma such as digoxin and gentamicin Blood pressure the balance of acids to bases the release of erythropoietin The activation of vitamin D1 the formation of glucose in the fasting state and the creation of peptide hormones all affect the GFR

A GFR of less than 60mlminute for three or more months indicates chronic kidney disease A GFR of less than 15mlminute indicates full failure of the kidneys GFR estimates between 60 and 89 mLminute do not mean a person has chronic kidney disease unless there are other signs of disease People with either higher than normal amounts of muscle mass such as bodybuilders or people with lower than normal amounts of muscle mass such as amputees or people with muscle wasting disorders can have GFR test results that do not appear normal but may still be normal A medical professional will explain the meaning of any GFR test done on a patient

Fallout is a role playing game for the computer This computer game was made by Interplay Entertainment It was completed in 1997 It takes place 84 years after nuclear bombs have turned the Earth into a desert and destroyed all the governments 

The player controls the character by using the mouse to make the character go places When the character gets there the player can make the character do other things Some things the character can do are fighting stealing and talking When the player is done playing in one town or place he or she can use a map to get to a new place 

Because life is hard in the game there are people who need help in every town The player can choose to help the good guys or the bad guys Helping the good guys gives karma points Helping the bad guys costs karma points A very evil character will have negative karma No matter who the player helps the character gets experience points which help the character get better at doing things 

The world is full of danger There are people who will try to kill the character and take his stuff and there are dangerous mutant animals that will try to eat the character When this happens the player must fight 

Combat in Fallout is like chess because every character gets a turn If the player attacks a character then that character cannot act until the player is done with that attack Then the character gets a turn to attack the player This goes on back and forth until one of them dies or runs away Some characters can do more actions per turn depending on how long it takes to do the action and how much agility the character has More agile characters can do more actions per turn 

The player and other characters in Fallout can attack with their fists with hand held weapons like sledgehammers with thrown weapons like grenades and with guns Guns can be as small as pistols or as large as gatling guns There are even energy weapons such as lasers 

In 2077 nuclear war erupted between the United States and China Most of the people on Earth died and the world became a desert Fortunately the United States government had already built underground fallout shelters called Vaults where some of the people went to survive The player character was born in Vault 13 in what had been California The people living in the vault were too scared to ever come out of the Vault so they stayed inside it for 84 years 

Then the computer chip that makes their water safe to drink breaks down The Vault does not have any extra Water Chips so they send the player character into the desert to find a new one He or she has 150 days to do or else the people in the Vault will die 

Although the search for a new Water Chip is what starts the game the player can do many other things while he or she is looking for the Chip and even afterward 

One interesting thing about Fallout is its retrofuturistic style Retrofuturism means that although the game is set in the future it looks like the past Another way of explaining retrofuturism would be to say that the game shows the kind of future that people in the past would have imagined 

Specifically Fallout is the future as 1955 America might have seen it This can be seen in the themes of the game  fear of nuclear war and a need for fallout shelters for safety  and in the artistic style or looks of the game For example all computers in Fallout contain either vacuum tubes or magnetic tape reels Of course no one at Interplay in 1997 thought that there would be vacuum tubes in the future but they put them in the game for the sake of retrofuturism 

Many famous actors voiced some of the characters in Fallout These include Richard Dean Anderson from MacGyver David Warner from Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country Tony Shalhoub from Monk Brad Garrett from Everybody Loves Raymond Keith David from Theres Something About Mary Richard Moll from Night Court and Tony Jay from ReBoot Also Ron Perlman from Hellboy was the narrator in the opening credits 

A lot of the people who worked on the game later joined Black Isle Studios a smaller company inside Interplay that just made role playing games One of the games Black Isle Studios made was Fallout 2 After Interplay shut Black Isle Studios down many of those game makers went on to start Obsidian Entertainment the game company that made Fallout New Vegas in 2010

Fallout was very popular when it came out and continues to be remembered as a great game It was ranked 4 on PC Gamers list of top games of all time in 2001 It was named 5 on the IGN list of the top 25 PC games of all time in 2007 and 19 in 2009 The year it came out it was awarded RPG of the Year by GameSpot and is now on their Greatest Games of All Time list Fallout was ranked 55 on IGNs 2005 top 100 games of all time and 33 in 2007

Stick insects are insects in the order Phasmatodea

The whole order is camouflaged as either sticks or leaves Leaf insects are generally the family Phylliidae They are found in South and southeast Asia to Australia 

There are in excess of 3000 described species with many more yet to be described in museum collections and in the wild 

The order has a worldwide distribution but most species are found in the tropics These tropic species vary from stick like species to those resembling bark leaves and even moss or lichen The stick insect can sometimes reach over 13 inches long

A few species such as Carausius morosus are even able to change their pigmentation to match their surroundings Many species are wingless or have reduced wings

Phasmids are herbivorous feeding mostly on the leaves of trees and shrubs Their eggs are usually camouflaged resembling plant seeds and may remain dormant for a full season or more before hatching The nymphs are born already closely resembling the adults

Stick insects like praying mantis show rocking behaviour in which the insect makes rhythmic repetitive side to side movements This may help crypsis by resembling vegetation moving in the wind 

Also the swaying movements may help the insects see objects against the background Rocking movements by these sedentary insects may replace flying or running as way to define objects in the visual field

Some species of phasmid are able to produce a defensive spray when threatened The spray contains pungent smelling volatile molecules which the insect gets from its food plant The spray from one species Megacrania nigrosulfurea is even used as a treatment for skin infections by a tribe in Papua New Guinea by virtue of its antibacterial constituents

Many stick insects are easy to care for and make good pets Almost 300 species have been reared in captivity

Extra time is an additional period of time added to a game if the score is tied at the end of normal time Some sports do not allow some of all of their games to end in a tie In score notation it is often written by the letters ET or aet aet stands for after extra time

In tournament play where only the winner advances to the next round professional association football add 30 minutes of extra time to the game The extra time is made up of two 15 minute periods If a game is still tied after extra time it is usually decided by kicks from the penalty mark commonly called a penalty shootout 

Extra time is also used in other sports including rugby union and rugby league where it usually lasts for 20 minutes In Australian rules football two five minute extra time periods are played in knockout finals matches when scores are tied at the end of the final quarter In Gaelic football two halves of ten minutes are played after a draw In major Gaelic football tournaments extra time is only used if a replay finishes in a tie In field hockey matches extra time of 7 minutes each way is played

In North American sports extra time is usually referred to as overtime for ice hockey it is usually sudden death which means that the overtime period ends with the first score made In college football a system of alternating possessions beginning at the opponents 25 yard line is used which plays out similarly to extra innings in baseball in that each team receives a chance to score and if the game is still tied another iteration occurs

British Pakistanis are people in the United Kingdom of Pakistani ancestry The UK has the second largest overseas Pakistani population after Saudi Arabia 

Pakistan came into existence in 1947 so documentation of the life of Pakistani Britons technically can only start from that year However Muslim immigrants from the part of British India now known as Pakistan entered the British Isles as early as the mid seventeenth century

Following the Second World War and the break up of the British Empire Pakistani migration to the United Kingdom increased specifically during the 1950s and 1960s as Pakistan was a part of the Commonwealth

The majority of the immigration began in the mid 1950s when manual workers were recruited to fulfil the labour shortage which resulted from World War II Many people began immigrating from Pakistan administered Kashmir after the completion of Mangla Dam in Mirpur in the late 1950s as well that destroyed hundreds of villages and stimulated a large wave of migration Up to 5000 people from Mirpur left for Britain

In the years to come many from Punjab began immigrating in the 1960s they worked in the foundries of the English Midlands and a large number worked at Heathrow Airport as well During the same time medical staff from Pakistan were recruited for the newly formed National Health Service Over 7000 Pakistani doctors currently work for the NHS

During the 1970s a large number of East African Asians who already held British passports entered the UK after they were expelled from Kenya Uganda and Zanzibar The Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 and Immigration Act 1971 largely restricted any further primary immigration although family members of already settled migrants were still allowed

David Boris Pall founder of Pall Corporation was the chemist who invented the Pall filter used in blood transfusions

Born in Thunder Bay Ontario of Russian immigrant parents he grew up on a farm in Saskatchewan and attended McGill University from which he was granted a bachelors degree in chemistry and a PhD in physical chemistry He moved to New York in 1938 and became a part of the Manhattan Project In 1946 he established Pall Corporation The companys initial focus was on the development of filters for use in aircraft hydraulics 

However in 1959 when Dr Palls first wife Josephine died of aplastic anemia he began to work on the Pall filter Mrs Pall had undergone multiple blood transfusions in the course of an illness which were ultimately unsuccessful The Pall filter makes blood transfusions significantly safer by filtering out white blood cells thereby reducing the incidence of transfusion reactions and viral infections Today Pall Corporation has sales in excess of 20 Billion

In his lifetime Dr Pall received over 180 patents and in 1990 he received the United States National Medal of Technology from President George HW Bush

Pall a trustee of the North Shore University Hospital died of complications of Alzheimers disease at his last home in Roslyn Estates New York

A peace treaty is different from an armistice which is an agreement to cease hostilities or a surrender in which one side agrees to give up its arms

Peace treaties are made in stages

Peace treaties may include various items

The earliest recorded peace treaty was between the Hittite and Egyptian empires The Battle of Kadesh took place in what is modern Syria The entire Levant was at that time contested between the Egyptian and Hittite empires After a costly four day battle in which neither side gained a clear advantage both sides claimed victory 

Fear of further conflict between the two states persuaded both rulers Hattusili III and Ramesses II to end their dispute and sign a peace treaty Both sides were threatened by other enemies Egypt had to defend her western border against Libyan tribesmen while the Hittites faced the threat of the Assyrian Empire which had conquered Mesopotamiap256 

The peace treaty was recorded in two versions One was in Egyptian hieroglyphics the other in Akkadian using cuneiform script Fortunately both versions survive Such dual language recording is common to many treaties This treaty differs from others in that the two language versions are differently worded Most of the text is identical but the Hittite version claims that the Egyptians came suing for peace while the Egyptian version claims the reversep7379 6264 

The treaty was made in year 21 of Ramesses reign probably 1258 BCp257 It contains a mutual assistance pact in case one of the empires should be attacked by a third party or in the event of internal strife There are articles on the forced repatriation of refugees and provisions that they should not be harmed So this might be called the first extradition treaty There are also threats of retribution should the treaty be broken

This treaty is so significant that a reproduction hangs in the United Nations headquarters

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors are a type of antidepressant drugs given for the treatment of depression They are good at treating atypical depression Parkinsons disease anxiety disorders social phobia and have also shown to help people to stop smoking tobacco

As MAOIs drugs can be fatal people if they take too much they are often only ever given when other antidepressant drugs have failed Some newer drugs such as selegiline and moclobemide have proven to be safer than the older MAOIs and are prescribed by physicians in the first instance 

MAOIs and RIMAs are used to provide a second line of treatment for certain psychiatric illnesses most commonly types of hard to treat depression with not normal symptoms and anxiety disorders with or without panic attacks They may also be used for social phobia MAO B inhibitors are used to treat Parkinsons disease Certain MAOIs have been shown to help people to stop smoking tobacco 

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors work by stopping the action of an enzyme called monoamine oxidase This enzyme breaks down a group of brain signalling chemicals called the monoamine neurotransmitters There are two types of the enzyme MAO A and MAO B Each type breaks apart different chemicals in the group MAO A breaks down melatonin serotonin epinephrine and norepinephrine MAO B breaks down phenylethylamine and the trace amines These chemicals are used in the brain for signalling purposes Dopamine for example is a chemical that affects motivation and pleasure Effectively they work on balancing the brains chemistry 

Like all drugs MAOIs and RIMAs can have effects that are not intended and are not part of the treatment that the drugs provide In this class of drug these include a risk of a hypertensive crisis This can be caused by high levels of tyramine such as by eating cheese except cream or cottage cheese meat extracts such as Bovril yeast extract stock cubes fermented soya bean products alcohol especially fortified wine beer and chainti wine Also preserved fish preserved poultry offal avocado banana skins broad bean pods and pickled or smoked herring must be avoided Certain medications can also cause a hypertensive crisis with MAOIs and RIMAs such as amphetamine fenfluramine ephedrine phenlyephrine phenylpropanolamine nasal decongestants L dopa pethidine and tricyclic antidepressants Use of a RIMA rather than a MAOI can reduce these side effects however tyramine rich foods should still be avoided 

A protein isoform is any of several different forms of the same protein Different forms of a protein may be produced from related genes or may be made from the same gene by alternative splicing A large number of isoforms are caused by single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs small genetic differences between alleles of the same gene These occur at specific individual nucleotide positions within a gene

Tori Amos is an American singer and songwriter who has won many awards for her music She was born on August 22 1963 in Newton North Carolina Her name by birth is Myra Ellen Amos Her father Edison Amos is a Methodist minister Her mother Mary Ellen Amos is part Cherokee Indian Her grandfather Calvin Clinton Copeland was very important to her as a child The things he taught her continue to be important to her as an adult

Tori Amos was an unusually talented child She was able to play piano at the age of two and a half years When she was two her family moved to Baltimore Maryland When she was five years old she was already writing her own songs on the piano At age five she won a scholarship to a very important music school called the Peabody Conservatory of Music Tori enjoyed writing her own music and making songs up as she went along but did not enjoy playing music that was written by other people as much Because of this they took her scholarship away at the age of eleven

When Tori was 14 she began singing and playing piano at bars Her father came with her to make sure she was safe She won a singing contest by singing a song she wrote called More Than Just a Friend When she was 18 Tori recorded her first song It was called Baltimore The song was entered into a contest being held by the Baltimore Orioles a baseball team Tori won the contest The song was released on a 7 vinyl record and the song on the other side was called Walking With You This record was Toris very first music release and 500 copies were made Today it is considered a very valuable item and costs a lot of money

When Tori was 21 she changed her name from Myra Ellen to Tori She moved to Los Angeles California to try and become a professional singer and musician She put together a rock and roll band which was called Y Kant Tori Read The name of the band was a joke about when she went to piano school and did not want to read printed music instead making up her own music The band included a guitarist named Steve Caton a drummer named Matt Sorum a bass guitar player named Brad Cobb and a keyboard player named Jim Tauber The band was signed to a recording contract with Atlantic Records In 1988 they released their first and only album also called Y Kant Tori Read It was released on 12 vinyl record cassette tape and CD The albums style was rock and roll and is a very different type of music from what Tori would become famous for later in her life

The album did not sell many copies It was considered a very big failure The band broke up Matt Sorum ended up becoming famous in the band Guns N Roses Brad Cobb became a successful musician also playing in many different bands Steve Caton later went on to perform with Tori on other projects until the year 1999

Tori was very disappointed with the failure of her album She had to continue recording more albums because she signed an agreement with Atlantic Records that said she had to record up to six albums if they asked her to Tori put together an album by herself but when she played the music for the people at the record label they did not like it She spent more time on the music changing the songs She took away some songs and added some new songs This time the record label people liked the record

In 1991 Tori released Little Earthquakes her second album The album became a big success The lyrics on the album were about very personal experience and feelings Tori had They were about topics like religion sex and growing up One song called Me and a Gun was very personal because it was about a time when Tori was raped

In 1993 Tori released Under the Pink her third album This album was even more successful than the last The lyrics continued on topics from Little Earthquakes including a song called Icicle which was about childhood masturbation

In 1996 Tori released Boys For Pele her fourth album This album was very different from her other albums It was much longer having 18 songs The music was more complicated including a lot of different styles of music and types of instruments Reviewers had different opinions about the album Many reviews said the lyrics were hard to make sense of and that the music was not easy to listen to Other reviews said the songs were very interesting and unique Despite the mixed opinions Boys For Pele was Toris most successful album to this day It was successful world wide

In 1998 Tori released From the Choirgirl Hotel her fifth album This album was also very different from her previous albums Instead of focusing mostly on piano and many different instruments like orchestras this album included a style of music called electronica This type of music often uses computers to create musical sounds and rhythms Tori also included a full band on most of the songs including guitar drums and bass guitar This was the first time she had done so since her album Y Kant Tori Read The lyrics of the album continued to be very personal Some topics included Toris own miscarriages of several babies and marriage Most of the reviews of this album were very positive and in the first week the album sold more copies than any of Toris other albums did in their first week However the albums total sales were not as high as any of her previous ones

In 1999 Tori released her sixth album To Venus and Back This was a double album Oftentimes a double album simply means that there are two discs cassettes or records included and many more tracks than a normal album In the case of To Venus and Back it was actually two separate albums packaged together under one theme The first album in the set was called Orbiting and was a full new album of 11 recorded songs The second album in the set was called Live Still Orbiting and was a collection of live songs recorded at Toris performances across the world Orbiting continued the electronica theme of From the Choirgirl Hotel with lyrics about things like growing up losing her babies in her miscarriages and homosexuality The album received most positive reviews A single from the album called Bliss was the very first song in history from a major record label to be sold on the internet as a digital song

At this point in her career Tori felt that her record label was not doing enough things to promote her music and albums She had only one album left to record and release for them according to their agreement In 2001 she released her seventh album Strange Little Girls This album featured songs that other singers and bands had written and recorded but sung by Tori with a new idea behind what they mean Part of the reason Tori did this was because she did not want to give her own songs which mean very much to her to the record label if they were not going to properly promote them The album featured Toris versions of songs by performers like Neil Young the band Slayer and the rapper Eminem The album was a concept album which means that all of the songs fit into one big idea Toris idea was to take songs that had been sung by men and sing them from a womans point of view The album received both good and bad reviews but it did not sell nearly as many copies as her other albums

In late 2001 Tori changed to the record label Epic In 2002 she released her eighth album called Scarlets Walk This album was another concept album In this concept Tori created a story about a woman named Scarlet Scarlet took a journey across America after the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 that happened in New York City Along the way Scarlet meets a lot of different characters mostly men She has romances friendships and gets involved in many situations Each song is about one of the people she meets or one of the things that happens to her The album was more successful than Strange Little Girls but did not meet the success of her other albums However the single A Sorta Fairytale was her most successful American radio single The music video for this song featured Oscar winning actor Adrien Brody

In 2003 Tori released a greatest hits album called Tales of a Librarian The album was the final part of her agreement with Atlantic Records She took many of her older songs and changed them in a recording studio giving them new sounds She also included two brand new songs

In 2003 Toris new label Epic joined together with another label called BMG Tori has said in interviews that this was not what she wanted to happen and that the new people in charge were more interested in making money than in making good music This year she also had a part in a movie called Mona Lisa Smile Tori played a singer at a wedding reception 

In 2005 Tori released her ninth album The Beekeeper This album had a more traditional pop and rock musical style Some described it as adult contemporary music The album was unusually long with 19 songs on a regular edition and 20 songs on a special edition The lyrics were about personal things in Toris life Many of them were about sickness and death This is because in the year she recorded it her mother nearly died of a heart attack and then her older brother died in a car accident Compared to her other albums the album did not sell very well The reviews of the album were both good and bad Many said the album was too long

Later in 2005 Tori released a series of albums which were called The Original Bootlegs There were six albums in total each with two CDs Each album was of a full length live concert performed for her The Beekeeper tour The albums were at first sold separately and later put together in a boxed set That year she also released a biography called Piece by Piece It was a best seller

In 2006 Tori released a DVD called Fade to Red It was a compilation of all of Toris music videos That same year she also released a very complex boxed set of music called A Piano This set had five CDs and compiled tracks spanning all the way back to the album Little Earthquakes The package for the set was shaped like a piano keyboard 

In 2007 Tori released her tenth album American Doll Posse This was another concept album This time Tori created several characters but instead of just writing stories about them she dressed up like them and created personalities for them Tori would wear costumes and wigs for the characters during her concert performances Each song on the album was supposed to be sung by one of the characters The themes and music style of this album was very much like The Beekeeper The album was even longer with 23 tracks on the regular version and 26 on the special edition It sold around the same number of copies as the previous album and reviews were similar as well Again many said the album was too long

Later in 2007 Tori released a series of albums which were called Legs Boots There were 27 full double albums released Each one was the content from a live show during her tour for the album American Doll Posse They albums were only available digitally there were no CD versions

In 2008 Amos made an agreement with her record label Epic and left the label She released a live concert DVD called Live in Montreaux 19911992 She then signed a contract with a new record label Universal Republic

In 2009 Tori released her eleventh album Abnormally Attracted to Sin Though the album got almost all good reviews it did not sell any better than her more recent albums Later that year she released an album called Midwinter Graces The album was like a holiday or Christmas album but Tori called it a seasonal album It contained both traditional carols and original songs by Tori Tori Amos sings in the mezzo soprano range

Blood and soil is an idea that started in the 19th century It looks at a persons blood to see where they come from and who their ancestors were It also looks at the soil a person is working on to make a claim that they should indeed work and occupy that land In the nineteenth century the idea was linked to racism and to nationalism One of the first to use Blut und Boden or blood and soil was Oswald Spengler in his book Der Untergang des Abendlandes In the book Spengler talks about the struggle of blood and soil about the inner form of a relocated species of animal and man Walther Darr took the phrase and established the link In his book Neuadel aus Blut und Boden he tries to show the relation between economic and agrarian policies as well as racial ones

Another idea of the blood and soil ideology comes from Lamarckism The ethnic characteristics of a population are linked to the geographical regions it inhabits only in this region will it be able to fully live up to its potential

Avimimus was a recently discovered maniraptoran It was a very fast moving light weight bird like theropod dinosaur that lived in the late Cretaceous in what is now Mongolia around 70 million years ago that may have had feathers

The forelimbs were relatively short The bones of the hand were fused together as in modern birds and a ridge on the ulna was interpreted as an attachment point for feathers by Kurzanov Kurzanov in 1987 also reported the presence of quill knobs and while Chiappe confirmed the presence of bumps on the ulna their function remained unclear Kurzanov was so convinced they were attachment points for feathers that he concluded that Avimimus may have been capable of weak flight The presence of feathers is now widely accepted but most paleontologists do not believe Avimimus could fly

The Constitution of the United Kingdom is a set of laws and rules in the United Kingdom that governs how the country is organized and the basic rights and freedoms of the people

The UKs constitution is not written in one single document like many other countries are In fact the UKs constitution is not completely written down at all Some of it can be found in writing starting with the Magna Carta of 1215 and the Bill of Rights Act 1689 and including more modern Acts of Parliament Other parts of it are considered common law and are made up of the decisions of judges over many hundreds of years in a system called legal or judicial precedence Because of this some people say that the United Kingdom has a de facto or unwritten constitution

Using the word unwritten is a problem because most British laws and rules are written as statutes or court judgments the law of equity and in various treaties Most of these laws come from the Parliament of the United Kingdom Because most of the constitution is written down in this way it is not technically correct to call it unwritten or de facto However these words are still used The Constitution of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is even more different to most other constitutions in that it is just a normal set of laws and not a higher law that the government cannot easily change The constitution has no more authority than any other law in the UK and the government can change it just by passing a new Act 

The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy This means it has a Queen or a King The Queen or King is decided by whether or not their parents or other close relative were King or Queen Oldest brothers used to get to be King first then the next brother and so on turning only to daughters when there were no sons Queen Elizabeth II changed this however and rewrote the law so that the eldest child would become the next monarch no matter what its gender was

German philosophy refers to philosophy written in German or by German philosophers It started in the 17th century during the Age of Enlightenment from Leibniz and Wolff through Kant Schelling Fichte Hegel Schopenhauer Marx Engels and into the times of Nietzsche and Wittgenstein

The philosophy that dominated this century was the school of German philosopher and mathematican Gottfred Leibniz later expanded by his follower Christian Wolff Leibniz thought that knowledge comes from reason alone

On the wake of the Enlightenment a new philosophy called critical philosophy developed in Germany It combined the ideals of philosophers Jean Jacques Rousseau of France and Switzerland and David Hume of Scotland and rationalism and empiricism The founder of this school was Immanuel Kant He published three critiques the most revolutionary being Critique of Pure Reason the other two being Critique of Practical Reason and Critique of Judgement Two followers of Kant Schelling and Fichte thought that Kants system had some errors and sought to improve it A third philosopher Hegel developed his own kind of German idealism His books are often difficult to read and his ideas influenced many people including those who agreed with him and those who did not

The ancient Library of Alexandria was a large and significant library of the ancient world It was founded in Alexandria Egypt The Library flourished under the patronage of the Ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship It was built in the third century BC

In ancient Latin the library was known as the ALEXANDRINA BYBLIOTHECE The Greek term bibliotheke used by many historians of the era refers to the collection of books not to any building This complicates the history and chronology 

The library was conceived and opened either during the reign of Ptolemy I Soter or during the reign of his son Ptolemy II 

Plutarch wrote that during his visit to Alexandria in 48 BC Julius Caesar might have accidentally burned the library when he set fire to his own ships to frustrate Achillas attempt to limit his ability to communicate by sea According to Plutarchs account this fire spread to the docks and then to the library

However this version of events is not confirmed in contemporary accounts of Caesars visit In fact it has been reasonably established that segments of its collection were partially destroyed on several occasions before and after the first century BC A modern view attributes the destruction to Coptic Christian Archbishop Theophilus of Alexandria in 391 who called for the destruction of the Serapeum  the Daughter library and a temple to the god Serapis

According to the earliest source of information the library was initially organized by Demetrius of Phaleron a student of Aristotle under the reign of Ptolemy I Soter

The library comprised a peripatos gardens a room for shared dining a reading room lecture halls and meeting rooms However the exact layout is not known This models influence may still be seen today in the layout of university campuses The library itself is known to have had an acquisitions department and a cataloguing department The hall contained shelves for the collections of scrolls known as bibliothekai It was rumored that carved into the wall above the shelves a famous inscription read The place of the cure of the soul

It was the first known library to gather a serious collection of books from beyond its countrys borders The Library was charged with collecting all the worlds knowledge It did so through an aggressive and well funded royal mandate involving trips to the book fairs of Rhodes and Athens and a policy of pulling the books off every ship that came into port They kept the original texts and made copies to send back to their owners Alexandria because of its man made bidirectional port between the mainland and the Pharos island welcomed trade from the East and West and soon found itself the international hub for trade as well as the leading producer of papyrus and soon enough books

The library was also home to a host of international scholars The library filled its stacks with new works in mathematics astronomy physics natural history and other subjects It was at the Library of Alexandria that the scientific method was first conceived and put into practice and its empirical standards applied in serious textual criticism As the same text often existed in several different versions comparative textual criticism was crucial for ensuring their accuracy Once ascertained copies would then be made for scholars royalty and wealthy bibliophiles the world over this commerce bringing income to the library The editors at the Library of Alexandria are especially well known for their work on Homeric texts The more famous editors generally also held the title of head librarian These included among others

Already famous in the ancient world the librarys collection became even more storied in later years Papyrus scrolls comprised the collection and although parchment codices were used predominantly as a more advanced writing material after 300 BC

A single piece of writing might occupy several scrolls King Ptolemy II Philadelphus is said to have set 500000 scrolls as an objective for the library Mark Antony supposedly gave Cleopatra over 200000 scrolls for the library as a wedding gift Carl Sagan in his series Cosmos states that the library contained nearly one million scrolls though other experts have estimated a smaller number No index of the library survives and it is not possible to know with certainty how large and how diverse the collection may have been 

A perhaps exaggerated story concerns how the librarys collection grew so large By decree of Ptolemy III of Egypt all visitors to the city were required to surrender all books and scrolls Official scribes then swiftly copied these writings some copies proving so precise that the originals were put into the library and the copies delivered to the unsuspecting owners This process also helped to create a reservoir of books in the relatively new city

According to Galen Ptolemy III requested permission from the Athenians to borrow the original scripts of Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides for which the Athenians demanded the enormous amount of fifteen talents as guarantee Ptolemy happily paid the fee but kept the original scripts for the library

The Bibliotheca Alexandrina was inaugurated in 2002 near the site of the old library

Hatshepsut meaning Foremost of Noble Ladies was the fifth Pharaoh of the 18th dynasty of Ancient Egypt She is generally regarded by Egyptologists as one of the most successful pharaohs reigning longer than any other woman of an indigenous Egyptian dynasty 

Her father was Thutmose I her predecessor was Thutmose II her successor was Thutmose III the son of Thutmose II by a lesser wife Tuthmose III was co regent with his stepmother and was head of the army but Hatshepsut was the effective ruler and the named Pharaoh

Today it is generally recognized that Hatshepsut assumed the position of Pharaoh The length of her reign usually is given as twenty two years since she was assigned a reign of twenty one years and nine months by the third century BC historian Manetho who had access to many records that now are lost Her death is known to have occurred in 1458 BC which implies that she became pharaoh circa 1479 BC

Hatshepsut established the trade networks that had been disrupted during the Hyksos occupation of Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period

Although many Egyptologists have claimed that her foreign policy was mainly peaceful there is evidence that Hatshepsut led successful military campaigns in Nubia the Levant and Syria early in her career

Hatshepsut was one of the most prolific builders in ancient Egypt commissioning hundreds of construction projects throughout both Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt that were grander and more numerous than those of any of her Middle Kingdom predecessors Later pharaohs attempted to claim some of her projects as theirs

She employed the great architect Ineni who also had worked for her father her husband and for the royal vizier Senemut During her reign so much statuary was produced that almost every major museum in the world has Hatshepsut statuary among their collections for instance the Hatshepsut Room in New York Citys Metropolitan Museum of Art is dedicated solely to some of these pieces

Following the tradition of most pharaohs Hatshepsut had monuments constructed at the Temple of Karnak She also restored the original Precinct of Mut an ancient goddess of Egypt at Karnak that had been ravaged by the Hyksos occupation She had twin obelisks at the time the tallest in the world erected at the entrance to the temple One still stands as the tallest surviving ancient obelisk on Earth the other has broken in two and toppled

Following the tradition of many pharaohs the masterpiece of Hatshepsuts building projects was her mortuary temple She built hers in a complex at Deir el Bahri It was designed and implemented by Senemut at a site on the West Bank of the Nile River near the entrance to what now is called the Valley of the Kings The focal point was the Djeser Djeseru or the Sublime of Sublimes a structure of perfect harmony nearly one thousand years before the Parthenon was built Djeser Djeseru sits atop a series of agricultural terraces that once were graced with lush gardens Djeser Djeseru is built into a cliff face that rises sharply above it Djeser Djeseru and the other buildings of Hatshepsuts Deir el Bahri complex are considered to be significant advances in architecture Another of her accomplishments is the Hatshepsut needle

Women had a high status in ancient Egypt and enjoyed the legal right to own inherit or will property A woman becoming pharaoh was rare however only Khentkaues Sobekneferu and Neferneferuaten preceded her in known records as ruling solely in their own name Twosret a female king and the last pharaoh of the nineteenth dynasty may have been the only woman to succeed her among the indigenous rulers 

In Egyptian history there was no word for a queen regnant and by the time of her reign Pharaoh had become the name for the ruler Hatshepsut is not unique however in taking the title Sobekneferu ruling six dynasties before Hatshepsut also did so when she ruled Egypt Hatshepsut had been well trained in her duties as the daughter of the pharaoh During her fathers reign she held the powerful office of Gods Wife She had taken a strong role as queen to her husband and was well experienced in the administration of her kingdom by the time she became pharaoh There is no indication of challenges to her leadership and until her death her co regent remained in a secondary role quite amicably heading her powerful armywhich would have given him the power necessary to overthrow a usurper of his rightful place if that had been the case

Hatshepsut assumed all of the regalia and symbols of the pharaonic office in official representations Many existing statues alternatively show her in typically feminine attire as well as those that depict her in the royal ceremonial attire Statues portraying Sobekneferu also combine elements of traditional male and female iconography and by tradition may have served as inspiration for these works commissioned by Hatshepsut After this period of transition ended however most formal depictions of Hatshepsut as pharaoh showed her in the royal attire with all of the pharaonic regalia

Modern scholars however have theorized that by assuming the typical symbols of pharaonic power Hatshepsut was asserting her claim to be the sovereign rather than a Kings Great Wife or queen consort The gender of pharaohs was never stressed in official depictions even the men were depicted with the highly stylized false beard associated with their position in the society

Moreover the Osirian statues of Hatshepsutas with other pharaohsdepict the dead pharaoh as Osiris with the body and regalia of that deity All of the statues of Hatshepsut at her tomb follow that tradition The promise of resurrection after death was a tenet of the cult of Osiris Since many statues of Hatshepsut depicted in this fashion have been put on display in museums and those images have been widely published viewers who lack an understanding of the religious significance of these depictions have been misled

Most of the official statues commissioned of Hatshepsut show her less symbolically and more naturally as a woman in typical dresses of the nobility of her day Notably even after assuming the formal regalia Hatshepsut still described herself as a beautiful woman often as the most beautiful of women and although she assumed almost all of her fathers titles she declined to take the title The Strong Bull which tied the pharaoh to the goddesses Isis the throne and Hathorby being her son sitting on her thronean unnecessary title for her since Hatshepsut became allied with the goddesses herself which no male pharaoh could Rather than the strong bull Hatshepsut having served as a very successful warrior during the early portion of her reign as pharaoh associated herself with the lioness image of Sekhmet the major war deity in the Egyptian pantheon

The Oracle of Amun proclaimed that it was the will of Amun that Hatshepsut be pharaoh further strengthening her position She reiterated Amuns support by having these proclamations by the god Amun carved on her monuments

Slime moulds or Slime molds are forms of life which live on the rainforest floor and many other parts of the world They slither over ground and fallen tree trunks in search of food They scatter spores like plants which grow into new slime moulds

They are a way of life or life form which has evolved a number of times Because they are not a monophyletic group they are put into several different phyla They have some features of fungi and some features of protozoa This was discussed by Anton de Bary in 1858

They spend part of their lives as isolated cells but come together when a chemical signal is released Then together they form a multicellular organism which reproduces and makes spores So they are both single celled and multicellular That is not all the multicellular form loses its cell walls and becomes a syncytium This is an organism with many nuclei but few or no cell walls

The single cells are amoeboid and haploid The multi nuclear stage is called a plasmodium It is diploid formed from fusions between pairs of amoeboid cells It gains nutrition by phagocytosing bacteria and food particles

As the food supply fades the plasmodium makes haploid cells by meiosis and they form the basis of spores The spores are kept and then distributed from a structure like a sporangium This life cycle is typical of the main group called Mycetozoa

Modern molecular biology has shown by sequence analysis that slime molds are not a monophyletic group They were once regarded as fungi but now they are split into three different groups and none of them are fungi Relationships between the groups are not yet understood

Bikonts are eukaryote cells with two flagellae There are three groups which have evolved slime mold form independently

Fonticula is a cellular slime mold which forms a fruiting body in a volcano shape Fonticula is not closely related to either the Dictyosteliida or the Acrasidae A 2009 paper finds it to be related to Nuclearia which in turn is related to fungi

Chevrotains also known as mouse deer are small even toed ungulates that make up the family Tragulidae

Mouse deer live in Asia They are about the size of a hare with short thin legs They stamp their small feet to signal to each other Mouse deer are extremely nervous When they are surprised they freeze immediately and then run away in a zig zag through the forest

Crab spiders are the Thomisidae family of spiders They have two front pairs of legs angled outward and bodies that are flattened and often angular Also like crabs Thomisidae can move sideways or backward 

Crab spiders use their powerful front legs to grab and hold onto prey while paralyzing it with a venomous bite

Crab spiders are hunters and ambushers Some species sit on or among flowers bark fruit or leaves where they grab visiting insects Their species use camouflage several different types are known 

Some species are disguised as birds droppings resting on a leaf Even at a close range it is difficult to tell the difference Crab spiders live in rainforests all over the world They get their name from the way they scuttle around like small crabs

Writer Max Blumenthal who reported on an attempt by one of the shows staff to advertise at a rally for former Alaska governor and Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin described The Political Cesspool as having a racist ideology and highlighted anti Jewish racist and homophobic comments that Edwards had made on his blog The Stephen Roth Institute has also written about the show noting that James Edwards openly espoused many of his guests views and during speeches to extremist audiences including members of the white supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens and the racist League of the South he gained the support of a wide array of extremists In an article about antisemitism in Belgium the Stephen Roth Institute commented on the shows interview with Filip Dewinter a member of the Belgian Parliament and a leader of the Vlaams Belang movement Newsweek magazine used one of co host Winston Smiths statements to argue that the rise in popularity of white racism is due to the combination of the late 2000s recession and the election of a black president Many such groups have been attempting to gain new recruits and increase their political power by rebranding themselves as defenders of white heritage while trying to hide their dislike of minorities and Jews Smith states the emphasis is different now We dont talk as much about what blacks have done to us were more focused on ourselves and our own culture

In 2005 the staff of The Political Cesspool organized a rally at Confederate Park which along with two other Confederacy themed parks in downtown Memphis has been the subject of a longtime disagreement for honoring Confederate soldiers and ideals The park had been criticized earlier by a black Shelby County official which attracted the notice of New York based activist Al Sharpton who was invited by the Reverend LaSimba Gray to hold a demonstration in Memphis Sharpton planned a march called the Rally for Dignity from downtown Memphis to another park honoring Confederate Lieutenant General Nathan Bedford Forrest who was involved early in the organization of the Ku Klux Klan Sharpton canceled the march after Edwards and The Political Cesspool staff obtained a permit to demonstrate in Confederate Park located along Sharptons planned march route

Sharpton settled for a protest at Forrest Park At the demonstration he argued that We need to show the rest of the world that the day for honoring people like this is over and said in an interview that his objections were not related to race but to Forrests Civil War era actions against the United States Estimates of attendance at the rallies vary according to the Southern Poverty Law Center James Edwards attracted about 200 white counter demonstrators to the Confederate Park vigil while Sharptons protest at Forrest Park attracted a few dozen black demonstrators whom Edwards referred to as rabble The Memphis Flyer estimated that Sharpton attracted about 250 supporters In the aftermath of the city park controversy show affiliates Edwards Farley Bonds and Rolen received the Dixie Defender Award from the Sons of Confederate Veterans

Later that year Memphis city councilman E C Jones awarded Edwards and Farley with a certificate in appreciation of outstanding contributions to the community Edwards and Farley also received an honorary city council membership from Jones who had previously appeared on The Political Cesspool According to The Commercial Appeal Jones had not listened to the show before the incident and was unaware of its views After a reporter informed him of the shows views Jones initially refused to say he was sorry However after another reporter confronted him with more details about the shows ideology he changed his view saying that he probably would not appear again Carol Chumney another member of the Memphis City Council was also invited to appear on The Political Cesspool but ultimately declined the invitation after listening to an episode of the show Chumney said what I heard was about advocating for prostitution So I told them I had other commitments

Christian Wilhelm Walter Wulff is a German politician of the conservative Christian Democratic Union He was elected to be the President of Germany on 30 June 2010 He served as Minister President of the state of Lower Saxony from 2003 to 2010

Wulff was born in Osnabrck and is Roman Catholic His father left the family and he grew up with his mother As a teenager he had to take responsibility for the care of his younger sister after his mother developed multiple sclerosis After completing his Abitur the Gymnasium in Osnabrck Wulff went to study law He specialised in economic law at the University of Osnabrck In 1987 and 1990 he passed the first and second state examinations in law He started to work as a lawyer

Since 1975 Wulff has been a member of the CDU From 1978 to 1980 he served as federal chairman of the Schlerunion This was a political high school student organization connected to the Christian Democrats He became the regional chairman of the Junge Union in Lower Saxony in 1983 In 1986 he was elected a city councillor in his hometown Since 1984 he has sat on the CDUs regional party council of Lower Saxony serving as its chairman since 1994

The Christian Democrats made Wulff candidate for state Prime Minister in 1994 However the popular office holder Gerhard Schrder won After four years in opposition the election in 1998 brought another opportunity for Wulff to become Prime Minister Indeed the federal Christian Democrat party led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl made Wulff another time the candidate

Wulff has been one of the four deputy chairmen of the CDU party at the federal level since 7 November 1998 He has also been a board member of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation since 2003

With Lower Saxony announcing deeper cuts of education and municipal services the stage was set for the 2003 election campaign Wulff entered the race as the favourite to win the election The Christian Democrats in the political wilderness since 1990 were returned to power in the Legislative Assembly gaining 483 of the vote Wulff was sworn in as Prime Minister on 4 March 2003 as the head of a coalition between centre right Christian Democrats and liberal Free Democrats

As Minister President Wulff has made a multitude of reforms This includes a restructuring of the primary education system in Lower Saxony as well as an increase of police officers When Wulff took office Lower Saxony faced a severe budget crisis It was the result from years of public deficits Painful cuts to public expenditure were enacted and implemented against considerable political resistance The measures included cuts in university funding and in benefits for the blind Other policies concern the reform of the administration Many measures have remained controversial

Prior to the 2005 Federal Election Wulff had been mentioned as a potential candidate for the German chancellorship Surprisingly in a spring 2005 poll 28 percent of all respondents named Wulff as their preferred candidate for the Christian Democrat nomination for Chancellor in the 2006 election As Wulff only began his first term as Prime Minister in early 2003 he is likely to dismiss such speculations in December 2014 Wulff was re elected deputy leader of the federal party with about 86 per cent of all delegates supporting him

In a speech Wulff expressed his opposition to euthanasia and warned of a retreat of moral values This can be seen as the first attempt to formulate a value based agenda for the 2008 legislative assembly and the 2009 federal elections In this context it is important to note that Chancellor Angela Merkel had been severely criticized for a lack of emotional warmth during the 2005 federal election campaign

Due to his popularity in Lower Saxony and in federal opinion polls Wulff was considered to be a contender for the office of Chancellor

After the 23 May announcement that federal elections will be advanced to September 2005 Wulff announced that he was not a candidate for the CDU nomination for Chancellor He has not completed his first term as Premier of Lower Saxony Instead Wulff declared his support for Angela Merkel She was the CDU leader in the Bundestag It was expected that the Christian Democrats would win the election and form a government and that Wulff would be given a position in this government However with the September 18 election resulting in a hung parliament the outcome is unclear Wulff continued to be named as a possible CDU candidate for Chancellor particularly if Chancellor Merkel failed to secure a decisive mandate in the 2009 federal election

Christian Wulff was elected President of Germany on 30 June 2010 He gon 625 of 1242 votes in the third ballot of the Federal Convention He is Germanys youngest President and the first Roman Catholic President in more than forty years Wullf was sworn in on 2 July 2010 in front of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat

His main rival in the election was Joachim Gauck a civil rights activist from East Germany and a former Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Archives Not a member of any party Gauck was nominated by the opposition SPD and Greens as their presidential candidate on 3 June

Wulff is succeeded as Prime Minister of Lower Saxony by David McAllister Wulffs candidacy for President of Germany in the 2010 presidential election was formally confirmed by Angela Merkel Guido Westerwelle and Horst Seehofer They are the heads of the CDU FDP and CSU parties

Christian Wulff met his first wife lawyer Christiane Wulff when they were both law students in Osnabrck in 1983 They married in March 1988 and have a daughter Annalena In June 2006 Wulff announced that he would divorce his wife In 2008 Wulff married an aide from the Prime Ministers Office Bettina Krner She has a son from a previous relationship On 12 May 2008 she gave birth to their first child together also a boy

Bernard made animal experimentation a part of the standard scientific method He famously wrote in 1865 that the science of life is a superb and dazzlingly lit hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen

He was born in 1813 in Saint Julien near Villefranche sur Sane He wrote comedies and other plays When he was 21 he went to Paris with his play and went to a critic But the critic suggested for him to study medicine instead of literature

In 1845 Bernard married Franoise Marie Martin for her money Her money helped him in his experiments but she was firmly against his methods and founded the first French society for anti vivisectionists When he died Bernard was given a public funeral This was something which had never been given by France to a man of science before

Vivisection is a doing a surgery as an experiment on a living organism usually animals It is sometimes used to mean animal testing itself The word is often used by people or organizations who dislike animal experimentation

Lee Kuan Yew GCMG CH is a Singaporean politician He was the first Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore from 1959 to 1990 

He was the co founder and first secretary general of the Peoples Action Party and led the party to a landslide victory in 1959 During his leadership Singapore separated from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965 and grew from an underdeveloped colonial outpost with no natural resources into a First World Asian Tiger He has remained one of the most influential political figures in South East Asia 

Under Singapores second prime minister Goh Chok Tong Lee served as Senior Minister He is currently Minister Mentor a post created when his son Lee Hsien Loong became the nations third prime minister on 12 August 2004

On 13 September 2008 Lee 84 underwent successful treatment for abnormal heart rhythm at Singapore General Hospital but he was still able to address a philanthropy forum via video link from hospital

Lee says in his autobiography that he is a fourth generation Chinese Singaporean his Hakka great grandfather Lee Bok Boon emigrated from the Dapu county of Guangdong province to the Straits Settlements in 1862 

Lee Kuan Yew was born at 92 Kampong Java Road in Singapore He was the oldest child of Lee Chin Koon and Chua Jim Neo As a child he was strongly influenced by British culture partly because of the influence of his grandfather Lee Hoon Leong who had given his sons an English education His grandfather gave him the name Harry and his father gave him the Chinese name Kuan Yew He was mostly known as Harry Lee until he turned 30 and his close friends and family especially in the West still know him by that name He started using his Chinese name after entering politics His name is sometimes written as Harry Lee Kuan Yew although this first name is not usually used in official settings

Lee and his wife Kwa Geok Choo were married on 30 September 1950 They have two sons and one daughter Kwa Geok Choos roots can be traced from Min Nan Tongan

Many of Lees family have important positions in Singaporean society and his children hold high government or government linked posts His elder son Lee Hsien Loong a former Brigadier General has been the Prime Minister since 2004 He is also the Deputy Chairman of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation of which Lee himself is the chairman Lees younger son Lee Hsien Yang is also a former Brigadier General and is a former President and Chief Executive Officer of SingTel a pan Asian telecommunications giant and Singapores largest company by market capitalisation Fifty six percent of SingTel is owned by Temasek Holdings a prominent government holding company with controlling stakes in a variety of very large government linked companies such as Singapore Airlines and DBS Bank Temasek Holdings was until 2009 run by Executive Director and CEO Ho Ching the wife of Lee Hsien Loong Lees daughter Lee Wei Ling runs the National Neuroscience Institute Lees wife Kwa Geok Choo used to be a partner of the prominent legal firm Lee Lee

Lee studied at Telok Kurau Primary School Raffles Institution and Raffles College He was stopped from going to university by World War II and the 1942 1945 Japanese occupation of Singapore During the occupation he ran a successful black market business selling tapioca based glue called Stikfas Because he had taken Chinese and Japanese lessons since 1942 he was able to find work transcribing Allied wire reports for the Japanese as well as being the English language editor on the Japanese Hodobu from 1943 to 1944

Lee had three main concerns national security the economy and social issues during his post independence administration

The vulnerability of Singapore was deeply felt with threats from multiple sources including the communists Indonesia and UMNO extremists who wanted to force Singapore back into Malaysia As Singapore gained admission to the United Nations Lee quickly sought international recognition of Singapores independence He declared a policy of neutrality and non alignment following Switzerlands model At the same time he asked Goh Keng Swee to build up the Singapore Armed Forces and requested help from other countries for advice training and facilities

Like many countries Singapore was not immune to political corruption Lee introduced legislation giving the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau greater power to conduct arrests search call up witnesses and investigate bank accounts and income tax returns of suspected persons and their families 

Lee believed that ministers should be well paid in order to maintain a clean and honest government In 1994 he proposed to link the salaries of ministers judges and top civil servants to the salaries of top professionals in the private sector arguing that this would help recruit and retain talent to serve in the public sector

In the late 1960s fearing that Singapores growing population might overburden the developing economy Lee started a vigorous Stop at Two family planning campaign Couples were urged to undergo sterilisation after their second child Third or fourth children were given lower priorities in education and such families received fewer economic rebates

During the three decades in which Lee held office Singapore grew from being a developing country to one of the most developed nations in Asia despite its small population limited land space and lack of natural resources Lee has often stated that Singapores only natural resources are its people and their strong work ethic He is widely respected by many Singaporeans particularly the older generation who remember his inspiring leadership during independence and the separation from Malaysia

On the other hand many Singaporeans have criticized Lee as being authoritarian and intolerant of dissent citing his numerous mostly successful attempts to sue political opponents and newspapers who express an unfavorable opinion International media watchdog Reporters Without Borders has asked Lee and other senior Singaporean officials to stop taking libel actions against journalists 

Lee has written a two volume set of memoirs The Singapore Story which covers his view of Singapores history until its separation from Malaysia in 1965 and From Third World to First The Singapore Story which gives his account of Singapores subsequent transformation into a developed nation

Devan Nair the third President of Singapore and who was living in exile in Canada remarked in a 1999 interview with the Toronto The Globe and Mail that Lees technique of suing his opponents into bankruptcy or oblivion was an abrogation of political rights He also remarked that Lee is an increasingly self righteous know all surrounded by department store dummies In response to these remarks Lee sued Devan Nair in a Canadian court and Nair countersued Lee then brought a motion to have Nairs counterclaim thrown out of court Lee argued that Nairs counterclaim disclosed no reasonable cause of action and constituted an inflammatory attack on the integrity of the government of Singapore However the Ontario Superior Court of Justice refused to throw out Nairs counterclaim holding that Lee had abused the litigating process and therefore Nair has a reasonable cause of action

On 24 September 2008 the High Court of Singapore in a summary judgment by Justice Woo Bih Li ruled that the Far Eastern Economic Review magazine defamed Lee and his son Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong The court found the 2006 article Singapores Martyr Chee Soon Juan meant that Lee Kuan Yew has been running and continues to run Singapore in the same corrupt manner as T T Durai operated the National Kidney Foundation and he has been using libel actions to suppress those who would question to avoid exposure of his corruption The court sentenced FEER owned by Dow Jones Company to pay damages to the complainants FEER appealed but lost the case when the Court of Appeal ruled in October 2009 that the Far Eastern Economic Review did defame the countrys founder Lee Kuan Yew and his son Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong

In geology a hotspot or hot spot is a portion of the Earths surface which experiences volcanism This may be caused by a rising mantle plume or some other cause Hotspots may be far from tectonic plate boundaries 

A volcanic hotspot is where lava pushes up from under the mantle and creates a volcano The earths plates move along and another volcano is created later This creates a chain of volcanoes such as in Hawaii

J Tuzo Wilson suggested in 1963 that volcanic chains like the Hawaiian Islands result from the slow movement of a tectonic plate across a fixed hot spot deep beneath the surface of the planet Hotspots are thought to be caused by a narrow stream of hot mantle convecting up from the Earths coremantle boundary called a mantle plume although some geologists prefer upper mantle convection as a cause

Geologists have identified some 4050 such hotspots around the globe Those under Hawaii Runion Yellowstone Galpagos Islands are the most active at present

Peak oil is the idea that at some point a country or the world will be producing the most oil it can ever produce at one time After this point less oil will be produced and therefore people will have to use less oil because it will cost more money Many scientists and governments are concerned about what will happen when there is less oil to go around

The first person to come up with this idea was MK Hubbertin the 1950s and 1960s who said that a graph of oil production looks like a curve Hubbert drew a graph in 1956 that predicted that the United States would reach its peak oil in the early 1970s The United States did indeed reach its peak oil in the early 1970s 

It is unclear as to when the worlds peak oil will happen though most scientists agree that it was reached in the early 2000s or will be reached before 2020 For example the International Energy Agency has said that peak oil may have happened in 2006

Q If a user is revert warring on a page you have decided to block them for 24 hours That user now on the user talk page requests unblock and has promised not to repeat Do you unblock

A It depends If the user is an established user who has been warned about it before I would not unblock If the user was new and the revert war wasnt over inserting vandalism I would probably unblock but watch them very closely They know they will be on a last chance so if they act up again Ill just block for the remainder of the original period My natural inclination is toward assuming good faith however as a newer user it is possible that I may be missing signs of long term abuse So I would ask for a second opinion in some cases especially as I start off

Q What is the difference between a punishment block and a prevention block Is there an example of when a punishment block would be acceptable

A A prevention block is when blocking the user is likely to prevent further damage to the encyclopedia a punishment block is solely for something that happened in the past The only time a punishment block of sorts is acceptable is in the form of a username softblock but the user is of course welcome to create an account with an acceptable name Otherwise blocks should always be prevention blocks Except for cases of clear trollingoutingsockpuppetry I think that it should always be clear that the block is to stop behaviour like that in the near future not to prevent the person from contributing It is similar to protection we usually protect when there has been damage in the past and there is likely to be damage in the future In general that should be why we block as well

It is possible that a block of a user who is blocked on another project may be seen as punitive but I have no issues with this if the user has also broken our rules even once They have had a chance to reform and if it is clear they are not going to be helpful here then we are preventing drama from other projects coming here and so it is still preventative Of course a lot of prevention blocks are naturally going to be seen as punishment blocks by the blocked user but that is something we cannot change

Q Could you describe what a personal attack is

A Well we do like to say comment on the content not on the contributor but commenting on the suitability of a users writing style is not a personal attack Commenting on their IQ however is In general an insult that is unrelated to the building of the encyclopedia is a personal attack Sometimes it is necessary to comment on the users behaviour or attitude or on the flaws of a particular opinion or argument and I dont feel that this is a personal attack as long as it is phrased in a constructive way not intended to spite the user Bringing up a users race religion sexuality or physicalmental capabilities in an irrelevant context is a personal attack So is any threat of violence or outing or legal action or anything else that makes an editors experience here highly unpleasant

That said regardless how established an editor is an attack is an attack Users should not be given more leeway because they are not new A user who has been around for some time should still get a warning if they make a personal attack and should still be blocked if they do it many times

Q Would you ever block a user or ip without any warnings 

A Yes if they were outingthreatening to harm a user or obviously evading a block or if they had a very inappropriate username

Q What would you do for a Klondike bar

A I would learn to play the banjo Just in case it does not flow to all I was being playfully sarcastic I dont subscribe to the too many admins school of thought after all we are all editors Best Jontalk 2321 5 July 2010

His fathers businesses included the Spanish Library the printing house of El Mercurio and the Valparaso newspaper of the same name The enterprise remained in the familys possession for 33 years In 1866 Tornero and his brother Orestes bought the enterprise from their father

Orestes took care of the library and its other parts while Recaredo continued running the printing house and the newspaper Later they formed the Tornero Sons Society with his father who was living outside Chile

Tornero was the only editor of El Mercurio de Valparaso from 1867 to 1870 In 1870 he partnered with Camilo Letelier Blanco Cuartn became the main editor of the newspaper later and suggested that it focus on culture and literacy

He published Chile Ilustrado in 1872 the first illustrated album of Chile with a descriptive guide historic politic industrial social and statistical review of the country and a rich graphic backup with more than 200 wood engravings and 10 litographs He was given a prize for this book at the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition

After running it for nine years he sold his part of the newspaper to Camilo Letelier He revisited Europe in 1875 and bought machinery to create the first paper mill in Chile in 1880 At that time he also started to publish foreign works translated into Spanish

After his return to Valparaso Tornero founded a library and a printing house in Almendral His brother Orestes died in 1881 and Tornero he took over the Mercurio library which was mainly focused on editing teaching material and works translated from French

President Jos Manuel Balmaceda had a bad relationship with the Chilean press For this reason Recaredo started the newspaper El Comercio to support him

Recaredo died in Santiago on July 26 1902

A brief clarification on the thread about Ottavas articles I followed links to those two pages from Ottavas foundation l post I didnt discuss it with him I just read the articles enjoyed them and updated the enwp articles with them They were better than the previous best available freely licensed articles on the topic and made good use of familiar sources 

It didnt occur to me that editing in userspace might be seen as suspicious  I assumed that was part of a slow moving local style guideline for writingsimplifying long pages which strongly discouraged anything in the main namespace that had not already been rigorously simplified There is no such policy on en and so no reason to wait In the case of The Authors Farce the local simple process seems to have taken 3 4 months Was this intentional Required is there some other reason why the articles articles listed here are not in the main article namespace

I agree with Fr33kman every one of those articles should make their way into the article namespace on simple And Djsasso makes a good point that simple should not be seen as a haven for trolls and banned users  Sj 1557 1 July 2010

The University of Melbourne is in Melbourne Victoria Opened in 1853 it is the second oldest university in Australia and the oldest in Victoria The main campus is in Parkville just north of the Melbourne CBD It has several other campuses across Victoria It has one of the largest financial endowments of any Australian university standing at 1105bn as of 2008

Melbourne is one of the top universities in Australia and the world In Australia it has a leading position in business education engineering arts law and medicine It is the second largest research organisation in Australia after the CSIRO In 2008 it spent AU6537m on research 

The university has over 35000 students and nearly 7200 staff members In 2008 it changed the way it organized its courses This to be like way American and European universities work The idea was to link to the European Unions Bologna process and get international acceptance for its degrees many people were unhappy with these changes Professor Glyn Davis AC is Melbournes current vice chancellor

Melbourne University was started by the Victorian Parliament in 1853 Classes began in 1855 with three professors and 16 students The buildings were officially opened by the Lieutenant Governor of the Colony of Victoria Sir Charles Hotham on 3 October 1855 The first chancellor Redmond Barry held the position until his death in 1880 

At first all the buildings were built in the gothic revival style In the 1950s a modernist style was started as the new house style resulting in the mix of university buildings seen today

The opening of the university was made possible by the wealth coming from the Victorian gold rush The university was to be a civilising influence at a time of rapid settlement and commercial growth It was not a religious university and was not allowed to offer in degrees in divinity The churches could only build colleges on only the northern edge The local population wanted useful subjects like law not useless subjects like classics The people of Melbourne won this argument and law was introduced in 1857 and medicine and engineering in the 1860s Women were let into courses in 1881

In 1902 the university was bankrupt when it was found out that the man in charge of the universitys money Frederick Dickson had stolen 24000 The universitys annual budget was 15000 Dickson was jailed for seven years This resulted in a royal commission that came up with new ways of funding and new courses including agriculture and education 

After World War II there were more students wanting to go to a university and Melbourne University became much larger and more inclusive

The 97th edition of the Tour de France takes place from the 3rd of July to the 25th of July

The Prologue is held in Rotterdam in the Netherlands After Amsterdam in 1954 Scheveningen in 1973 Leiden in 1978 and sHertogenbosch in 1996 Rotterdam is the fifth city in the Netherlands which host the start of the Tour de France

As of 10 July 2010

As of 1st July

During this Tour de France 327 million are distributed At the start each team receives 51 243 In return each team presents in the arrival with at least seven riders obtained a prime of 1 600 per rider present

It rewards the overall leader adding the times achieved on each step In case of equal time in the general classification the hundredths of a second recorded by the timekeepers at the time trial individual are reintroduced into the total time to separate athletes and decide the attribution of the Yellow jersey

The points classification is based on the following scale 

The classification of the mountain is based on the following scale 

Points awarded in the climb off categorized 1st and 2nd categories are doubled when its the last mountain pass of the stage

The classification is reserved for young riders born in 1985 or later The first of them in the general classification is declared leader of the best young rider

The general team classification is established by adding the three best individual times from each team in all stages After the last stage the team credited with the shortest time is declared the winner of the team standings

The combativity award reward the rider who was the most generous in the effort and showing the best sportsmanship in the stage After the last stage a Super Competitor is designated by members of the Jury of the Tour de France

Growth rings are an interesting thing A growth ring is a ring inside a tree You can tell how old a tree is by its rings or how old a house is by the wood in the furniture or walls Counting the growth rings of a tree is a way to tell how old a tree is

How tree rings are developed

Tree rings grow under the bark and the bark is pushed out while the tree is growing The inner part of a growth ring is formed early in the growing season when growth is fast and is known as early wood The outer portion is the late wood and is denser than early wood Many trees in places with hot summers and cold winters make one growth ring a year

For the entire life of a tree a year by year record or ring pattern is formed that reveals the climate conditions in which the tree grew If a tree grows in a dry place you can tell its age better than when it grows in a wet place Switching in between bad and good conditions can result in several rings forming in one year Tree ring growth patterns are effected by the climate weather rain temperature soil pH plant nutrition CO2 concentration and sunspots

Rings happen because of the change in growth speed through winter spring summer and fall so one ring usually marks the passage of one year in the life of the tree Tree rings are more visible in places where the seasons change between hot and cold Enough moisture and a long growing season result in a wide ring A dry year may result in a very narrow ring Trees from the same area will tend to grow the same pattern of rings Cut all the way though a tree horizontally like a stump to find the growth rings

Tree growth rings can tell us about the ancient climate and growth rings can be used to tell the age of a tree Growth rings can also be used to date the wood in old buildings ships and frames for paintings Tree rings are used to make radiocarbon dating more accurate

Some perennial herb species form annual growth rings in their roots that basically follow the same principles as growth rings in trees

Norwich International Airport Airport codesNWIEGSH is an airport in the city of Norwich United Kingdom Norwich has regular flights to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol ran by KLM which have been operating for many years Other services run both internationally or within the British isles

An IATA airport code is a three letter code that can be used to identify airports This removes the need to write the name of the airport in full every time it is needed instead an IATA code can be used

An important use of these codes is on baggage tags They will display the IATA code for the airport which the bags should be heading to should they get lost

An ICAO code is the code used by pilots and air traffic controllers to identify airports simply and easily

The code is made up of four numbers or letters These are not the same as IATA codes which are often simpler and are made to sound like the airports name For example people who fly from Heathrow airport are likely to know it best as either Heathrow or by its IATA code LHR They are less likely to know its ICAO code EGLL

Boston is the capital city of Massachusetts in the United States It was founded in 1630 Boston is one of the oldest wealthiest and most culturally important cities in the United States

Boston was founded on November 17 1630 by Puritan colonists from England Bostons early European settlers called the area Trimountaine They renamed the town for Boston England in Lincolnshire because many important Pilgrim colonists came from there Most of Bostons early citizens were Puritans Shortly after Bostons settlement Puritans created Americas first public school and Americas first university Harvard University Harvard is in the city of Cambridge which is across the Charles River from Boston Until the 1760s Boston was Americas largest city

During the early 1770s The British tried to control the thirteen colonies with taxes This made people from Boston start the American Revolution The Boston Massacre the Boston Tea Party and several early battles happened in or near the city It held its first town meeting in Faneuil Hall in 1743

Boston continued to grow and attract immigrants from around the world Many immigrants came from Ireland and gave Boston a very Irish culture that remains today President John F Kennedy was a member of an Irish American family that lived in Boston Many immigrants also came from Italy and lived in Bostons North End

The tallest towers in Boston are the Prudential Tower and the John Hancock Tower

Boston has a culture thats quite similar to New England such as a New England accent and foods that are mostly seafood salt and dairy products Irish Americans are very important in Bostons politics and religious activities Boston people also have a style of talking which is called Boston slang

It is often thought that Bostonians have a strong sense of culture Perhaps this is because Boston is famous for being a very intellectual place with much of its culture coming from its universities The city has many complex theatres including the Cutler Majestic Theatre Boston Opera House Citi Performing Arts Center the Colonial Theater and the Orpheum Theatre

Boston is one of the United States most important cities in education and health care Boston and the towns around it contain many of the countrys leading universities Harvard MIT and Boston University are some of the most famous

The Parti Qubcois is a political party that wants sovereignty for the province of Quebec The Parti Qubcois want Quebec to become its own country or succeed from Canada

The Parti Qubcois or PQ was founded by Ren Lvesque PQs main goals are to get independence for Qubec In the provincial election of 1976 the Parti Qubcois was elected to the government of Qubec for the first time and Ren Lvesque became the premier of Quebec Many French people in Qubec were happy to see the Lvesque as premier while many English people were not happyCitation neededdateFebruary 2010

The PQ passed a bill called Bill 101 This bill is a law that makes French the languages used most in Quebec even though English and French are the languages spoken in Canada The party was elected again in the 1981 election but in November 1984 founder Ren Lvesque left the party and the PQ lost the 1985 election

The Parti Qubcois started the first Quebec referendum having the citizens vote to decided to either leave Canada or stay a part of the country 60 per cent of the people who voted decided to stay in Canada The PQ had a second referendum in 1995 The citizens once again voted to stay in Canada The leader of the part acques Parizeau quit after the referendum failed

The current Bloc Qubcois leader Gilles Duceppe was the first to announce that he would to try to become the leader of the PQ on May 11 2007Pauline Marois also said she was going to try to become leader but Duceppe changed his mind on the 12th leaving Marois the only candidate On June 26 2007 Marois won the leadership Pauline Marois is the current leader of the She has said that the PQ plans to have another referendum in the future

Wheel gymnastics is a form of gymnastics which originated in Germany 

Wheel gymnasts do exercises in a large wheel known as the Rhnrad gymnastics wheel gym wheel or German wheel

There are three main categories of exercise in wheel gymnasts They are straight line spiral and vault

While being a child Otto Feick the son of a blacksmith from Reichenbach Germany used to roll down a hill in two wagon tires which inspired him later to invent the wheel gymnastics between 1920 1922 The current wheel gymnastics obtained its final shape in 1974 with the introduction of the PVC coating SATUS WASHINGTON Rhnrad Einmaleins Bern SATUS Now its a competitive sport practiced in Belgium Denmark Netherlands Austria Switzerland Japan and United States of America 

Trampolining is a competitive Olympic sport in which gymnasts perform airborne acrobatics while bouncing on a trampoline These can include simple jumps in the pike tuck or straddle position to more complex combinations of forward or backward somersaults and twists 

There are two related competitive rebound sports synchronized trampoline and double mini trampoline The currently accepted basic format for individual trampoline competitions usually consists of two or three routines one of which may involve a compulsory set of skills The skills consist of various combinations of somersaults shaped bounces body landings and twists performed in various body positions 

In the early 1930s an American gymnast George Nissen observed trapeze artistes performing tricks when bouncing off the safety net He made the first modern trampoline in his garage to reproduce that net on a smaller scale and used it to help with his diving and tumbling activities It was the beginning of a new sport

In the USA trampolining was quickly introduced into school physical education programs and was also used in private entertainment centers Since trampolining became an Olympic sport in 2000 many countries have started developing programs for producing very competitive athletes

Priapulida are a phylum of marine worms Their name refers to their extensible spiny proboscis which in some species may have a shape similar to that of a human penis They live in the mud which they eat in comparatively shallow waters up to convert90mft

Their nearest relatives are probably Kinorhyncha and Loricifera with which they constitute the taxon Scalidophora Besides arthropods and velvet worms the priapulids are the only members of the Ecdysozoa which are relatively large in size They feed on slow moving invertebrates such as polychaete worms

Priapulid fossils are known at least as far back as the Middle Cambrian They were probably major predators of the Cambrian period There are only sixteen known living species of priapulid worms

Kinorhynchans are segmented limbless animals with a body consisting of a head neck and a trunk of eleven segments Unlike some similar invertebrates they do not have external cilia but instead have a number of spines along the body plus up to seven circles of spines around the head These spines are used for movement withdrawing the head and pushing forward then gripping the substrate with the spines while drawing up the body 

The body wall consists of a thin layer which secretes a tough cuticle this is molted several times while growing to adulthood This layer is a syncytium containing nuclei but no cell membranes

The spines are moveable extensions of the body wall and are hollow and covered by cuticle The head is completely retractable and is covered by a set of neck plates called placids when retracted

The nervous system is typical for invertebrates It consists of a ventral nerve cord with one ganglion in each segment and an anterior nerve ring surrounding the pharynx Smaller ganglia are also located in the lateral and dorsal portions of each segment but do not form distinct cords Some species have simple ocelli on the head and all species have tiny bristles on the body to provide a sense of touch

There are two sexes that look alike A pair of gonads are located in the mid region of the trunk and open to pores in the final segment In most species the sperm duct includes two or three spiny structures that presumably aid in copulation although the details are unknown The larvae are free living but little else is known of their reproductive process

Their closest relatives are thought to be the phyla Loricifera and Priapulida Together they constitute the Scalidophora

Phylum Kinorhyncha

Loricifera is a recently discovered phylum of marine animals The phylum includes the first animals known to exist in a completely anoxic environment The phylum was described in 1983 by Reinhardt Kristensen 

They are a phylum of very small animals which live in sediment There are now twenty two described species in eight genera In addition there are about 100 more species which have been collected but not yet described Their size ranges from 100m to about 1 mm 

Their habitat is in the spaces between marine gravel to which they attach themselves They are among the most recently discovered groups of Metazoans They attach themselves quite firmly to the gravel and this explains why they remained undiscovered for so long The first specimen was collected in the 1970s and later described in 1983 They are found at all depths of water in different sediment types and in all latitudes They have not yet been found in the fossil record

These animals have a protective outer case called a lorica Protected by the lorica the animals have a head mouth and digestive system Development is usually direct though there are larvae in some species The animals have two sexes as adults There are some complex and flexible life cycles with different forms of parthenogenetic reproduction 

Their closest relatives are thought to be the Kinorhyncha and Priapulida with whom they share some characteristics Together they make up the super phylum Scalidophora

Three species of Loricifera have been found in the sediments at the bottom of the LAtalante basin in the Mediterranean Sea The surface of this basin is 3500 meters down They are the first multicellular organisms known to spend their entire lives in an oxygen free environment It is thought they are able to do this because they rely on organelles which unlike normal mitochondria do not use oxygen for their energy cycle

The newly reported animals complete their life cycle in the total absence of light and oxygen and they are less than a millimetre in size They were collected from the deep basin where they live in a nearly salt saturated brine This brine because of its density does not mix with the waters above As a result the brine is completely anoxic and high in ammonia Also due to the action of sulphate reducers it contains sulphide at a high concentration In the brine the abundance of cells is not high Extremophiles predominate including members of the deep sea hydrothermal vent community of archaea and bacteria Eukaryotes are also found in lAtalante including ciliates dinoflagellates and choanoflagellatap360381

The most common use of the term saturation in chemistry is

Saturation is the point at which a solution of a substance can dissolve no more of that substance and additional amounts of it will appear as a solid precipitate 

This point of maximum concentration the saturation point depends on the temperature of the liquid as well as the chemical nature of the substances involved If a change in conditions means that the concentration is actually higher than the saturation point the solution has become supersaturated

A sulphide is an anion of sulphur in its lowest oxidation number of 2 Sulphide is also a term for thioethers a common type of compound which are known for their bad odours

The dianion S2 exists only in strongly alkaline aqueous solutions 

In chemistry a sulphate is a salt of sulphuric acid The sulphate ion is a group of atoms with the formula SO4 and two negative charges It consists of a central sulphur atom surrounded by four equivalent oxygen atoms It occurs when sulfuric acid is deprotonated twice If it is only deprotonated once the hydrogen sulfate ion is made

The LAtalante basin is a very salty lake at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea

It is about 190 km west of the island of Crete It is called a lake because though it is under more than two miles of water it is almost completely separate from the sea above it Its huge salt content prevents the waters mixing Sometimes these lakes are called brine pools They are found in many oceans there is one in the Gulf of Mexico

LAtalante is only one of several such lakes underneath the normal waters of the Mediterranean When the Strait of Gibraltar was closed about six million years ago the Mediterranean dried up and became a huge salt lake rather like the Dead Sea and the Great Salt Lake are today Then it dried out completely leaving an enormous amount of salt When the Straight of Gibraltar opened again about five million years ago water from the Atlantic Ocean rushed in to form the Mediterranean we see today Even today the Atlantic feeds the Mediterranean with water because the evaporation from the Med is greater than is provided by its rivers With its huge supply of salt underneath and the constant evaporation the Med is a high salt sea compared with the Atlantic 

The LAtalanta lake and its neighbours the Urania and Discovery lakes are about 35000 years old They were formed by salt deposits dissolving out of the Mediterranean Ridge and collecting in deep depressions at the bottom of the Med LAtalante is the smallest of the three Its surface begins at about convert3500mftabbronlkoff below sea level

LAtalantes salinity is near saturation at 365 about eight times more than seawater This prevents the water in the brine pool from mixing with the normal seawater above Without mixing oxygen from above cant get into the brine pool The basins water is completely anoxic it has no oxygen 

Between the normal water and the brine is a short boundary zone called a halocline The salt content rises sharply there and oxygen reduces towards zero This halocline between the seawater above and the brine below has many bacterial and archaeal cells they are chemoautotrophs which feed on ammonia from the brine but cannot function without some oxygen Certain methane oxidizers and haloarchaea are found only in the halocline

Below in the brine the number of cells is much lower than in the halocline Extremophiles are most common including some of the deep sea hydrothermal vent archaea and bacteria Eukaryotes are also found in lAtalante mostly ciliates dinoflagellates and choanoflagellatap360381 

The dark grey anoxic sediments at the bottom of LAtalante lake are covered with a convert1cmin1abbronlkoff loose black layer Microbes found in the sediments are almost all various species of Bacillus In 2010 three metazoan species all in the Loricifera phylum were discovered living in the sediment the first multicellular lifeforms known to live entirely without oxygen 

Tactical voting happens when a person votes for someone other than their favorite candidate in a way to either help their favorite or achieve some other goal This may happen in national or local elections or even in elections for clubs and homeowner associations

Say 5 people are running as candidates for board members but only 3 will be elected For the following situations except the last lets say you get 1 vote

Another common situation happens in primary elections where members of one party may temporarily cross over to the other party to support a candidate who is getting less votes hoping their favorite will face weak competition in the main election This type of negative voting is popular but often considered unethical

Many experts question tactical voting in that it can undermine a democratic outcome That is ethical voters may believe it more important how a candidate wins than who wins Others feel the end justifies the means Most researchers tend to frown on tactical voting

In the 1990s the term alternative country began to be used to talk about different groups of musicians and singers who did not follow the same traditions of regular country music and who had a different sound Many of them did not follow the high production values of the big country music industry at the time which was mostly based in Nashville Tennessee 

Lyrics in alternative country might be depressing or about social issues and often from the heart They do not follow the clichs sometimes used by mainstream country musicians as often In other ways the sounds of alternative country artists do not always have much in common They can include traditional American folk tunes bluegrass and other types of sounds It can be music that does not sound like mainstream rock or country This has become even more confusing with alternative country artists saying that they do not want to be called alternative country with more mainstream artists saying they are alternative country and with people saying that older musicians or musicians from the past are alternative country No Depression the most popular magazine about alternative country said that it covered alternative country music Even though not everybody agrees on what makes music alternative country most people agree that alternative country came from traditional American country music 

In the 1980s in southern California some musicians tried to make some music that had parts of country and parts of punk This was called the cowpunk scene It had bands like Jason and the Scorchers These styles came together in Uncle Tupelos popular album No Depression which came out in 1990 Many people think it was the first alternative country album A magazine called No Depression later came out that was written about alternative country The magazine was named after Uncle Tupelos album The band made three more important albums and joined a big record label The band broke up in 1994 Musicians in the band and people around the band later started three other important alternative country bands Wilco Son Volt and Bottle Rockets Bottle Rockets signed along with acts like Freakwater The Old 97s and Robbie Fulks to the Chicago based indie record label Bloodshot They played a type of alternative country called insurgent country The bands Blue Mountain Whiskeytown Blood Oranges and Drive By Truckers kept going in this direction before most began to move more in the direction of rock music in the 2000s

The Constitution of Australia is the laws that set up the Australian Commonwealth Government and the way it works It is made up of several documents The most important is the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia The people of Australia voted in referendums from 18981900 to accept the Constitution The Constitution was then passed as a part of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom Queen Victoria signed it on 9 July 1900 The Constitution became law on 1 January 1901 Even though the Constitution was an Act of the United Kingdom parliament the Australia Acts took away the power of the United Kingdom parliament to change the Constitution Now only the Australian people can change it by referendum

Two other laws support the Australian Constitution The first is the Statute of Westminster as passed by the Commonwealth as the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 The second is the Australia Act 1986 which was passed by the Parliaments of every Australian state the United Kingdom and the Australian Federal Parliament Together these Acts had the effect of cutting all constitutional links between Australia and the United Kingdom Even though the same person Queen Elizabeth II is the monarch of both countries these are now separate countries

Under Australias common law system the High Court of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia have the power to decide what the constitution actually means

The history of the Constitution of Australia began with moves towards federation in the 19th century This led to the Australian colonies joining together to form the Commonwealth of Australian 1901 

In the mid 19th century the Australian colonies needed to work together on things that affected them all especially tariffs between the colonies This cooperation led to plans to join the colonies together in a single federation The push to do this was mainly coming from Britain and there was little local support The smaller colonies thought they would be taken over by the larger ones Victoria and New South Wales did not agree about the need to protect local industry as opposed to allowing everyone to trade freely The then recent American Civil War also weakened the case for federalism These difficulties led to the failure of several attempts to bring about federation in the 1850s and 1860s

By the 1880s Australians were worried about the growing presence of the Germans and the French in the Pacific Along with a growing Australian identity this created the opportunity to start the first inter colonial body the Federal Council of Australasia in 1885 This Federal Council could make laws on certain subjects but did not have a permanent office an executive or its own source of income New South Wales the largest colony would not take part

Henry Parkes the Premier of New South Wales pushed for a series of conferences in the 1890s to talk about federalism The first one was in Melbourne in 1890 and another the National Australasian Convention in Sydney in 1891 These were attended by colonial leaders By the 1891 conference many people wanted a federal system Most of the discussion was about how this federal system would work With help from Sir Samuel Griffith a draft constitution was written These meetings did not have popular support The draft constitution also left out important but difficult issues such as tariff policy The draft of 1891 was given to colonial parliaments but was not supported by New South Wales Without NSW the other colonies were unwilling to continue

In 1895 the six premiers of the Australian colonies agreed to set up a new Convention by popular vote The Convention met over the course of a year from 1897 to 1898 The meetings produced a new Constitution that was the same as the 1891 draft but with added provisions for responsible government To get popular support the draft was voted on by the electors of each colony After one failed attempt a changed draft was given to the electors of each colony except Western Australia Five colonies passed the Bill that was then sent to the Westminster Parliament with a letter requesting the Queen to make it into law

The British government made one change before the Bill was passed The Chief Justices of the colonies wanted the right to appeal decisions of the High Court to the Privy Council on constitutional matters They were worried that the limits of the powers of the Commonwealth or States could be changed by parliament The British Parliament passed the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act in 1900 Western Australia finally agreed to join the Commonwealth in time for it to join the Commonwealth of Australia which officially began on 1 January 1901

In 1990 the Public Records Office in London loaned the original copy 1900 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act to Australia The Australian government wanted to keep the copy The British parliament agreed by passing the Australian Constitution Act 1990

Although Federation made Australia independent of Britain legally the Commonwealth was a creation of the British Imperial Parliament through the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 which applied to Australia As a result there was continued uncertainty as to whether British Imperial laws still applied to the Commonwealth This was fixed by the Statute of Westminster 1931 adopted by the Commonwealth via the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 The Statute of Westminster freed the Dominions including the Commonwealth from Imperial laws and controls Legally this is the moment of Australias national independence

However British laws were still more important in Australian states This was fixed by the Australia Act 1986 which was passed by the parliaments of Australia the United Kingdom and each of the states This law stopped the British Parliaments power to make laws over Australian states It also stopped appeals from the Australian courts to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council As this was a very important document Queen Elizabeth II travelled to Australia to sign the proclamation of the law

One result of these two laws is that Australia is now a fully independent country The Constitution is now different from the original Act as the Australian people can change the Constitution by referendumfactdateJune 2009 However the original Act remains on the UKs law book with a note saying The Constitution is not necessarily in the form in which it is in force in Australia Even if the United Kingdom Parliament were to remove the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 it would have no effect on AustraliaFactdateApril 2009

The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 contains a Preamble and nine sections Sections 1 8 are explain the laws to set up the Commonwealth Section 9 starting with the words The Constitution of the Commonwealth shall be as follows contains the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia The Constitution itself is in eight chapters with 128 sections

Chapter I sets up the Parliament of Australia This has three parts 

Section 1 says that legislative power belongs to the Parliament It is the most powerful part of government

Part II of Chapter 1 is about the Senate Senators are to be directly chosen by the people of the State voting as a single electorate Each State is to have the same number of senators Currently there are 12 senators for each State and 2 each for the mainland territories the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory

Part III of Chapter 1 is about the House of Representatives Section 24 says the House must have twice as many members as the Senate each elected by a single electorate This is called the Nexus It designed to prevent swamping of the senates power in the case of a joint sitting The number of electorates in a State is to be based on its share of the national population

Part IV of Chapter 1 says who can vote who can be elected to the parliament how much members can be paid parliamentary rules and related matters

Part V of Chapter 1 is about the powers of the parliament Section 51 deals with powers of the Commonwealth parliament and are called specific powers There are concurrent powers as both the Commonwealth and States can make laws on these subjects Federal law is more important if the laws are different Of the thirty nine parts of section 51 a few have become very important in deciding how much power the Commonwealth government has in law These include the Trade and Commerce Power the Corporations Power and the External Affairs Power Section 52 deals with powers that belong only to the Commonwealth parliament States cannot make laws on these subjects

Chapter II sets up the executive branch of government Executive power is to be exercised by the Governor General advised by the Federal Executive Council The Governor General is the commander in chief He or she may appoint and dismiss the members of the Executive Council ministers of state and all officers of the executive government These powers along with the powers to dissolve parliament are termed reserve powers The use of these powers is by convention Generally the Governor General acts only on the advice of the Prime Minister There has been only one instance of the Governor General not taking the Prime Ministers advice Governor General Sir John Kerr acting on his own dismissed Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis

Reserve powers in all Westminster nations are only extremely rarely exercised outside of the understood conventions However in contrast with the constitutions of other Commonwealth Realms such as Canada which formally grant extensive reserve powers to the Monarch even the formal powers of the Queen of Australia are extremely limited and most powers can only be used by the Governor General 

Section 68 says that the Command in chief of Australias naval and military forces as being The command in chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the Governor General as the Queens representative The Commander in chief of the Australian Defence Force is now Her Excellency Quentin Bryce as the Governor General of Australia The Queen of Australia is not in command of the military

Chapter III sets up the judicial branch of government Section 71 gives judicial power in a Federal Supreme Court to be called the High Court of Australia The Parliament can also make new federal courts or give other courts federal powers Such courts are called Chapter III Courts are the only courts that can use federal judicial power Sections 73 and 75 78 outline the original and appellate jurisdiction of the High Court Section 74 explains how an appeal can be made to the Queen in Council Section 79 allows Parliament to limit the number of judges able to exercise federal jurisdiction and section 80 guarantees trial by jury for indictable offences against the Commonwealth

Chapter IV deals with finance and trade in the federal system Section 81 says that all Commonwealth revenue shall form the Consolidated Revenue Fund Parliament can make laws as to the how its money is spent Unlike most other powers of the parliament laws made under this power cannot usually be challenged Section 90 gives the Commonwealth exclusive power over duties of custom and excise

Section 92 provides that trade commerce and intercourse among the States shall be absolutely free The precise meaning of this phrase is the subject of a considerable body of law

Section 96 gives the Commonwealth power to give money to States on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit This power is not limited by any other part of the Constitution such as Section 99 that forbids giving preference to one State or over another State It is subject only to Section 116 freedom of religion and possibly other such freedoms This power which was only meant to be used has been used by the Commonwealth to encourage cooperation by the States to various extents over the years

Section 101 sets up an Inter State Commission a body which is no longer exists but which was meant to have a significant role in the federal structure

Chapter V sets out how what the States can do in a federal system Sections 106 108 preserves the Constitution powers of the Parliament and the laws in force of each of the States

Section 109 says that where a State law is different to a federal law the federal law is the legal law

Section 111 says that a State can give up any part of its lands to the Commonwealth This has happened several times South Australia gave the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth

Section 114 stops any state from having its own military force It also stops the State or the Commonwealth from taxing each others property

Section 116 sets out freedom of religion by stopping the Commonwealth from making any law to start a religion imposing any religious observance or stop a religion or religious discrimination for public office

Chapter VI allows new states to be made or to join the Commonwealth Section 122 allows the Parliament to provide for the representation in Parliament of any new territory Section 123 says that changing the boundaries of a State needs the support of the Parliament of that State and must pass a referendum in that State

No new states have joined the Commonwealth since federation

Chapter VII says that the seat of government of the Commonwealth shall be in New South Wales but no less than one hundred miles from Sydney and that the Governor General may appoint deputies Section 127 first said that Aborigines cannot be counted in any Commonwealth or State census This section was changed in 1967

Chapter VIII sets out how the Constitution can be changed Section 128 says that changes must be approved by a referendum A successful change needs

The Governor General must put the referendum bill to the people between two and six months after passing parliament After the constitutional amendment bill has passed both the parliament and the referendum it then receives Royal Assent from the Governor General This makes it the new law and the wording of the Constitution will be changed

An exception to this process is if the amendment bill is rejected by one house of Federal Parliament If the bill passes the first house and is rejected by the second then after three months the first house may pass it again If the bill is still rejected by the second house then the Governor General may choose to still put the bill to the peoples vote

As mentioned above changing the Constitution requires a referendum in which the Yes vote achieves a majority nationally as well as majorities in a majority of states

Forty four proposals to change the Constitution have been voted on at referendums Eight have been approved The following is a list of changes that have been approved 

As well as the written Constitution and Letters Patent issued by the Crown conventions are an important part of the Constitution These have developed over the years and define how various constitutional mechanisms work in practice

Conventions play a powerful role in the operation of the Australian constitution because of its set up and operation as a Westminster system of responsible government Some important conventions include

However because conventions are not written down their existence and practice are open to debate Real or alleged violation of convention has often led to political controversy One extreme case was the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975 in which the operation of conventions was seriously tested The ensuing constitutional crisis was resolved dramatically when the Governor General Sir John Kerr dismissed the Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam appointing Malcolm Fraser as caretaker Prime Minister pending the 1975 general election A number of conventions were said to be broken during this episode These include

In line with the common law tradition in Australia the law on the interpretation and application of the Constitution has developed largely through judgments by the High Court of Australia in various cases In a number of seminal cases the High Court has developed several doctrines which underlie the interpretation of the Australian Constitution Some examples include

The vast majority of constitutional cases before the High Court deal with characterisation whether new laws are part of the power granted to the Commonwealth government by the Constitution

The Australian Constitution does not include a Bill of Rights Some people at the 1898 Constitutional Convention wanted a Bill of Rights like the United States Constitution but the majority felt that the traditional rights and freedoms of British subjects were enough These would be protected by the Parliamentary system and independent judiciary which the Constitution would create As a result the Australian Constitution has often been criticised for not protecting rights and freedoms

Some rights were included

In 1992 and 1994 the High Court of Australia found that the Constitution gave an implied right to freedom of political communication in a series of cases including the Australian Capital Television case and the Theophanous case This was seen as a necessary part of the democratic system created by the Constitution The application of this implied right has however been restricted in later cases such as Lange v ABC It is in no way equivalent to a freedom of speech and only protects individuals against the government trying to limit their political communication it offers no protection against other individuals

In 2007 the High Court of Australia in Roach v Electoral Commissioner said that sections 7 and 24 of the Constitution by providing that members of the House of Representatives and the Senate be directly chosen by the people created a limited right to vote This means that there is a universal franchise in principle and limited the Federal Parliaments legislative power to change it In the case a legislative change to stop all prisoners from voting was rejected as breaking that right

Other attempts to find other implied rights in High Court cases have not been successful

While a pro forma preamble prefaces the Imperial Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 the Australian Constitution itself does not have a preamble There have been some calls to add one to express the spirit and aspirations embodied in the constitution However there has been fierce opposition usually on the basis of the content of the preamble as well as possible legal ramifications of this text In 1999 a proposed preamble written by John Howard the then Prime Minister was defeated in a referendum held concurrently with the Republic referendum The Yes vote did not achieve a majority in any of the six states

There have been many people who have wanted Australia to become a republic On 6 November 1999 Australians did not support a law to remove the Queen and replace the Governor General with a President The President was to be appointed by a two thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth Parliament Opinion poll results said that the majority of Australians are in favour of some form of a republic Many voters who voted against the 1999 referendum wanted to be able to vote for a President In research and polling following the 1999 referendum people said that an appointed President would not be able to act independently of the Parliament By being able to appoint the President rather than having the people elect a President many felt that too much power was being given to Parliament with no check or balance on that power Support for holding another referendum in the near future seems to be growing and another referendum may be held Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said the current situation no longer reflects either the fundamental democratic principles that underpin the Australian nation or its diversity He was thinking about a referendum for an independent elected President He went on to say that over the next year there would be an accelerated public debate about the monarchy question

Constitution Day is celebrated on 9 July the date the Constitution became law in 1900 The date is not a public holiday Constitution Day was first held on 9 July 2000 to mark the centenary of the Constitution as part of the Centenary of Federation The celebrations were not big and have not been widely held after 2001 Constitution Day was revived in 2007 and is jointly organised by the National Archives of Australia which holds the original Constitution documents and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship

Wildlife management is a general term for the process of keeping wild species at desirable levels as determined by wildlife managers Wildlife management can include game keeping wildlife conservation and pest control Wildlife management has become an integrated science using disciplines such as mathematics chemistry biology ecology climatology and geography to gain the best results

Wildlife conservation aims to halt the loss of species It does this by taking using ecological principles to balance the needs of wildlife with the needs of people Most wildlife is concerned with the preservation and improvement of habitats Techniques can include reforestation pest control irrigation coppicing and hedge laying

Game keeping is the management or control of wildlife for the wellbeing of game birds It may include killing other animals which share the same niche or predators to maintain a high population of the more profitable species such as pheasants introduced into woodland In his 1933 book Game Management Aldo Leopold one of the pioneers of wildlife management as a science defined it as the art of making land produce sustained annual crops of wild game for recreational use

Igor Sikorsky was a Russian man who moved to the United States built and improved upon the first helicopter that could be used

His helicopter was first shown to be useful when he added a winch on it Soon after this it saved the lives of two sailors during a hurricane

He also started Sikorsky Aircraft a huge helicopter manufacturing company which produces famous helicopters such as the Sea King and Skycrane

Since his death his office at Sikorsky Aircraft has been left exactly as it was when he died

Food poisoning is when someone gets sick from eating food or drink that has gone bad or is contaminated There are two kinds of food poisoning poisoning by toxic agent or by infectious agent Food infection is when the food contains bacteria or other microbes which infect the body after it is eaten Food intoxication is when the food contains toxins including bacterially produced exotoxins which can happen even when the microbe that produced the toxin is no longer present or able to cause infection Even though it is commonly called food poisoning most cases are caused by a variety of pathogenic bacteria viruses prions or parasites that contaminate food rather than chemical or natural toxins which are what we usually call poison According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about 76 million people in the United States become ill from the food they eat and about 5000 of them die every year

Symptoms start many hours to many days after eating Depending on what the cause of the poisoning was they can include one or more of the following nausea abdominal pain vomiting diarrhea gastroenteritis fever pain in the head or fatigue

In most cases the body is able to permanently get better after a short period of acute discomfort and illness Foodborne illnesses can result in permanent health problems or even death especially for people at high risk including babies young children pregnant women elderly people sick people and others with weak immune systems

Foodborne illness due to campylobacter yersinia salmonella or shigella infection is a major cause of reactive arthritis which typically occurs 13 weeks after diarrheal illness Similarly people with liver disease are especially susceptible to infections from Vibrio vulnificus which can be found in oysters or crabs

Tetrodotoxin poisoning from reef fish and other animals shows up very quickly in symptoms such as numbness and shortness of breath and is often fatal

The Rngrado May First Stadium or May Day Stadium is a multi purpose stadium in Pyongyang North Korea completed on May 1 1989

The stadium was built as a main stadium for the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students in 1989 It is currently used for football matches a few athletics matches but most often for Arirang performances The stadium can seat 150000 which is the largest stadium in the world that is not used for auto racing

Its name comes from the place where it is Rungra Islet in the Taedong River and May Day the international day celebrating labour

The stadium is most famous for being the place where large shows celebrating Kim Il sung and the North Korean nation were held In June July 2002 the Arirang gymnastic and artistic performances were held there There were 100000 people taking part double the number of people watching and was open to foreigners which is rare These performances now happen every year usually in August and September The Guinness Book of Records has recognized these events as the largest in the world

In 2000 Kim Jong Il used the stadium to entertain Madeleine Albright the US Secretary of State under President Bill Clinton

Badwater Basin is a basin in Death Valley National Park Death Valley California The water which goes into it does not flow into any ocean 

Badwater Basin is the lowest point in North America at convert282ftabbron below sea level Mount Whitney the highest point in the 48 states is only 76 miles west of the Basin

Badwater Basin has a small natural pool of undrinkable water next to the road The water comes from a spring It is called Badwater because people cannot drink the water This is because so much salt has built up from the basin The pool does have animals and plants living there including pickleweed insects and the Badwater snail

The pool is not actually the lowest point of the basin The lowest point is several miles to the west the exact point which is lowest changes However the salt flats are dangerous to travel across therefore the sign states that the lowest point is at the pool where people can see it Some people say that it is the lowest point in the Western Hemisphere but this is not true The lowest point is actually Laguna del Carbn in Argentina at 105 meters

At Badwater Basin big rainstorms sometimes flood the bottom of the valley They cover the salt pan with a thin sheet of standing water This makes new lakes but the lakes do not last long This is because the average convert19in of rain that falls every year is much lower than the a 150 inch annual evaporation rate so all the water evaporates away This means that even a 12 foot deep 30 mile long lake would dry up in a single year While the basin is flooded some of the salt dissolves and goes back into the basin as clean crystals when the water evaporates

Painted on the cliff above Badwater is a sign that says Sea Level which people visiting like to look at

During the Holocene when the regional climate was less dry streams that ran from mountains in the area slowly filled Death Valley until it was 3 feet deep Eventually there was a convert80miabbron long lake Lake Manly

The wet times with much rain did not last The temperature got warmer and there was less rain The lake began to dry up and as the water evaporated the lake became saltier Eventually only a soup of brine was left Salts began to turn into crystals covering the surface with a thick crust from three inches to five feet thick

The Bush Doctrine is a term which many people use to describe several foreign policy and national defense decisions that President George W Bush made

The Bush Doctrine is usually used to describe how Bush invaded Iraq in what is known as pre emptive war

George W Bush did not make up this term and he never said what he thought about the term

There are other United States presidential doctrines also

A speech was made by American President Harry S Truman to the US Congress on 12 March 1947 In this speech he said he thinks that The United States should help Greece and Turkey to stop them being Totalitarianists although he meant Soviet Communism This became known as the Truman Doctrine Some Historians believe that this was the start of the Cold War 

This speech was made after The United Kingdom said that they would stop helping Greece and Turkey in February 1947 since The United Kingdom was also poor after the cost of World War II This meant that Greece and Turkey would still be poor and Truman believed that a poor Eastern Europe would be Communist more easily unless helped by The United StatesTruman wrongly thought that the Soviets were helping the Greek Communist partisans when there were no clear proof 

This plan was a big change to American politics Political historian Walter LaFeber wrote that the doctrine became an ideological shield which means that he believed that The United States used the doctrine as an excuse or reason The Marshall Plan came after because this 

God Defend New Zealand is one of the national anthems of New Zealand The other national anthem is God Save the Queen but that is not sung very often Most people in New Zealand call God Defend New Zealand the national anthem

The words were written by Thomas Bracken in the 1870s On 1 July 1876 the poem appeared in a local newspaper as part of a competition The competition was to see who could compose the best music to fit the words The prize was ten guineas Twelve entries were received and the winner was a young teacher named John Joseph Woods It was first performed on Christmas Day 1876 in Dunedins Queens Theatre

100 years later 7750 people signed a petition to make God Defend New Zealand the national anthem of New Zealand After this was presented to Parliament Queen Elizabeth II gave permission for it to become New Zealands second national anthem equal to God Save the Queen

Usually only the first verse of the English and the Mori versions are sung with the Mori first The Mori version is not a translation of the English version but was written to fit the melody

John Joseph Woods was a New Zealand teacher and songwriter He is best known for winning a competition to set God Defend New Zealand a poem by Thomas Bracken to music By doing this he composed the tune to what later became New Zealands national anthem Woods was also the Tuapeka County Council clerk for 55 years

Woods was born in Tasmania in 1849 into an Irish family with fourteen other children seven boys and seven girls His father was a soldier After teaching in Tasmania for nine years he came to New Zealand as a young man and worked for a time in Nelson Christchurch Dunedin and Invercargill Eight years teaching in New Zealand led to a position as the head teacher of St Patricks School in Lawrence Otago and he moved there from Invercargill in 1874 Woods was known as a good musician He was choirmaster of the local Catholic church and could play twelve different instruments though he was best known for his skill on the violin Singing a solo at his own wedding Woods showed that he was also a good singer 

While in Lawrence Woods taught with an Irish widow called Harriet Conway who already had two sons They were married in September 1874 and had four children together three sons and a daughter named Mary 

In 1902 Woods built a house of brick and wood on the corner of Lismore and Lancaster Streets He lived there until he died in 1934 It is now under the care of the Historic Places Trust which mounted a plaque on the street facing back wall to remember his composition of the national anthem

One night in the winter of June 1876 Woods read about the competition in the Saturday Advertiser According to tradition he usually met the coach that delivered the news in the main street of Lawrence to pick up his paper It was already 9 pm but he went straight to his piano and in that one sitting composed the tune for what later became the national anthem In a later letter to AH Reed he explained that the words inspired him so much he had to write music for them He entered his composition under the pen name of Orpheus The Advertiser sent it off with the eleven other submissions to Melbourne where it was judged In October 1876 it was announced that the three judges all agreed that Woods composition was the clear winner The prize was ten guineas

The rules of the competition meant that the copyright of the music would belong to the Saturday Advertiser which gave the manuscript to the Dunedin based Charles Begg Co to publish but a nine month delay in sending it to a publisher was followed by two months of waiting for it to be printed The end result was a very poor edition with only one verse which was thrown out by the Advertiser When promises of reprint failed to come true the Advertiser was forced to hand the copyright back over to Woods He immediately arranged for it to be printed by Hopwood and Crew in London with Brackens blessing Bracken did not mean for his poem to become the national anthem and it was Woods who had always used the word anthem where Bracken called it a hymn

Being a choirmaster Woods focus in composing the melody was to make it simple and easy for children to sing This proved to help its success when the Premier George Grey visited Lawrence on 11 March 1878 and was welcomed by six hundred local schoolchildren singing what was by then beginning to be labelled as the national anthem Grey was very taken by the music and immediately sent a telegram to Bracken congratulating him

In 1877 Woods stopped teaching and became the county clerk for the Tuapeka County Council He was known for working 13 hour days and keeping accounts of such a high standard that he was accepted as a fellow of the Registered Accountants of New Zealand Serving in this role he also became known as an authority on county law sought out by the council and clerks of other regions He also organised the decoration of council office buildings to mark Queen Victorias Diamond Jubilee in 1897

He served in that role for 55 years until ill health forced him to retire in 1932 aged 83

Woods was deeply involved in the affairs of the town He was a member of many local clubs and societies He was also known as an expert on cultivating daffodils of which his collection was the largest in the area In 1884 Woods was elected first president of the local choral society

When Woods was made an Honorary Freeman of New Zealand he was commended for his efficiency integrity and devotion to duty

Joseph Carey Merrick was an English man who had a deformed face and body because of an illness To make money he was shown at freak shows and was called the Elephant Man He then became famous after he went to live at the London Hospital Some people who wrote about him thought he was called John Merrick but they were wrong Merrick was born in Leicester England and started to become deformed when he was very young He was also disabled after he hurt his hip When he was 11 his mother died and his father married another woman Merrick left school aged 12 and tried to find a job but it was difficult because he was deformed and disabled His father and stepmother did not want him at home so he left home and when he was 17 he went to live in a workhouse

In 1884 Merrick wrote to a showman called Sam Torr and asked him to show Merrick as a freak exhibition Torr showed Merrick around the East Midlands and then Merrick went to London He stayed in a shop on Whitechapel Road with people paying to look at him A surgeon called Frederick Treves came to see Merrick and took photographs of him Soon afterwards Merricks shop was closed by the police and he went to Belgium

In Belgium Merrick was robbed by his manager and left in Brussels alone He found his way back to London and Frederick Treves took him to the London Hospital where he worked Merrick was allowed to live there for the rest of his life Rich and famous people of Victorian London came to visit him there

Merrick died on 11 April 1890 aged 27 He died of either asphyxia or a broken neck He had tried to lie down to go to sleep but his head was too heavy for him to do that Today nobody knows for sure what was wrong with Merrick Scientists think that he either had an illness called neurofibromatosis type I one called Proteus syndrome or both of these illnesses In 1980 film director David Lynch made a film about Merrick called The Elephant Man

John Logie Baird was a Scottish engineer and inventor of the worlds first working television system and the worlds first fully electronic colour television tube

Baird was born in Helensburgh Dunbartonshire Scotland He went to school at Larchfield Academy in Helensburgh and then went to the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College and the University of Glasgow He stopped being a student at the beginning of World War I

Although lots of inventors helped to make television Baird was an important person and made big advances Especially in Britain lots of people say that Baird was the first person to make a live moving greyscale television picture from reflected light Baird did this by making a better photoelectric cell and making the signal conditioning better 

In 1925 Baird showed people his moving pictures on television at Selfridges department store in London In 1928 he showed the worlds first colour television transmission 

In 1927 Baird made a signal go over convert438mikm between London and Glasgow Baird sent the worlds first long distance television pictures to the Central Hotel at Glasgow Central Station

Baird then started the Baird Television Development Company Ltd and in 1928 it made the first transatlantic television transmission from London to Hartsdale New York and the first television programme for the BBC

Bairds television systems were replaced by the electronic television system developed by EMI Marconi

Baird did lots of work for the field of electronic television after mechanical systems stopped being used In 1939 he showed colour television using a cathode ray tube 

Some of Bairds early inventions did not work In his twenties he tried to make diamonds by heating graphite and ruined Glasgows electricity supply Later Baird made a glass razor which did not get rusty but it shattered

An AIDS orphan is a child who became an orphan because at least one of their parents died of AIDS

The Joint United Nations Programme on HIVAIDS the World Health Organization and the United Nations Childrens Fund use the term AIDS orphan to talk about children whose mothers died of AIDS before the childs 15th birthday whether the childs father is still alive or not Because of this some people say that 80 of all AIDS orphans still have one parent who is still alive

There are 70000 new AIDS orphans a year People in the past have guessed that by the year 2010 over 20 million children would be AIDS orphans

Because most people who get AIDS are people who have sex most people who die of AIDS are people who make most of their familys money This means that many AIDS orphans need help from their countrys government to live and need money This happens a lot in Africa especially

In 2007 South Africa had more AIDS orphans than any other country In 2005 the country with the highest percentage of AIDS orphans among the countrys orphans was Zimbabwe

Endianess refers to how hexadecimal data is ordered in machine language the simplest most understandable code that a computer can use

In computer coding certain numbers usually two bytes long that are called words can be written or input in two ways little endian and big endian It depends on the data format and the way the computer reads the data

Say that we have a word like this

 12AB   12 AB 

Now the way its written right now is big endian because the bigger number is on the end

To write it in little endian we simply switch the positions of the first two and the last two bits so it becomes

 AB12   AB 12

The age of majority is the age that children in a country become adults by law This means that they are legally in control over their own actions and decisions and their parents are no longer responsible for them When used this way the word majority means having the full number of years to be an adult The opposite is minority which means being a minor or child The law in a given place may never actually use the words age of majority when deciding when people become adults The age of majority is a legally fixed age and idea of adulthood which is different in different places It may not match the actual maturity of a persons body or mind

Once a person reaches the age of majority there are some things they can do that they could not do before These may include buying stocks voting buying or drinking alcohol driving cars on public roads and marrying without having to ask for permission The ages that these things can be done are different depending on where the person lives

Even after a person reaches the age of majority there may be other age based rules that they still have to follow such as the right to stand for office in elections or become a judge For example the youngest a person is allowed to purchase alcohol is 21 in all US states even though the age of majority is 18 The age of majority in the Republic of Ireland is 18 but a person must be over 21 years old to stand for election 

Emancipation is when a child is freed from the responsibility and care of their parents or legal guardians before they reach the age of majority This is different from the way a child is given into foster care emancipation allows the minor to be treated as an adult before they have actually reached the age of majority

In almost all places minors who are married are automatically emancipated Some places also do the same for minors who are in the armed forces or who have a certain degree or diploma 

Parvicursor is a genus of tiny maniraptoran dinosaur with long slender legs for fast running At only about 39 cm from snout to end of tail and 162 grams in weight it is one of the smallest non avian dinosaurs known from an adult specimen

Caenagnathasia was a small oviraptorosaurian dinosaur measuring only 1 m in length and weighing around 8 kg Like all oviraptorosaurs Caenagnathasia had three fingers on each hand and three toes on each foot with bone fusion similar to that of birds 

Caenagnathasia lived in the Upper Cretaceous around 90 million years ago

Anchiornis is a genus of small feathered troodontid dinosaurs Anchiornis huxleyi is named in honour of Thomas Henry Huxley the first to propose a close evolutionary relationship between birds and dinosaurs A complete individual would be 34 cm and weigh only 110 g making it the smallest known feathered dinosaur

Anchiornis fossils have been found in Liaoning China dating to the mid late Jurassic period 160 to 155 million years ago

Anchiornis is a small early troodontid dinosaur with a triangular skull like other troodontids Also Anchiornis had long legs usually an indication of a strong runner However the extensive leg feathers indicate that long legs may be an vestigial trait because running animals tend to have reduced not increased hair or feathers on their legs The forelimbs of Anchiornis were also very long unusual among troodontids but similar to dromaeosaurids and early birds emphasizing its basal position among dinobirds 

While the first specimen of Anchiornis preserved only faint traces of feathers around the preserved portion of the body the well preserved second specimen showed nearly complete feather preservation allowing researchers to identify the structure of the feathers and how they were distributed

As in other early birds such as Microraptor Anchiornis had large wings made up of flight feathers attached to the arm and hand as well as flight feathers on the hind legs forming an arrangement of fore and hind wings The forewing of Anchiornis was composed of 11 primary feathers and 10 secondary feathers Unlike Microraptor the primary feathers in Anchiornis were about as long as the secondaries and formed a more rounded wing with curved but symmetrical central vanes a small and thin relative size and rounded tips all indicating poorer aerodynamic ability compared to its later relative In Microraptor and Archaeopteryx the longest forewing feathers were closest to the tip of the wing making the wings appear long narrow and pointed However in Anchiornis the longest wing feathers anchored near the wrist making the wing broadest in the middle and tapering near the tip for a more rounded less flight adapted profile

The hind wings of Anchiornis were also shorter than those of Microraptor and were made up of 1213 flight feathers anchored to the tibia and 1011 to the metatarsus Also unlike Microraptor the hind wing feathers were longest closer to the body with the foot feathers being short and directed downward almost perpendicular to the foot bones Unlike any other known Mesozoic dinosaur the feet of Anchiornis were completely covered in feathers

Two types of simpler downy feathers covered the rest of the body as in Sinornithosaurus Long downy feathers covered almost the entire head and neck torso upper legsand the first half of the tail The rest of the tail bore pennaceous tail feathers

In 2010 a team examined numerous points among the feathers of an extremely well preserved Anchiornis specimen to survey the distribution of melanosomes the pigment cells that give feathers their colour By studying the melanosomes and comparing them with those of modern birds the scientists were able to map the colours and patterning present on Anchiornis when it was alive Though this technique had been used before Anchiornis became the first Mesozoic dinosaur for which almost the entire life colouration was known

Most of the body feathers of Anchiornis were grey and black The crown of head feathers was mainly reddish with a grey base and front and the face had rufous speckles among predominantly black head feathers The fore and hind wing feathers were white with black tips The coverts were grey contrasting the mainly white main wings The larger coverts of the wing were also white with grey or black tips forming rows of darker dots along mid wing These took the form of dark stripes or even rows of dots on the outer wing but a more uneven array of speckles on the inner wing The shanks of the legs were grey other than the long hind wing feathers and the feet and toes were black

Like many modern birds Anchiornis exhibited a complex pattern of coloration with different colours in speckled patterns across the body and wings or within and among feather plumage coloration In modern birds such colour patterning is used in communication and display either to members of the same species or to threaten and warn off competing or predatory species

Anchiornis is notable for its long forelimbs which were 80 of the total length of the hind limbs This is similar to Archaeopteryx long forelimbs are necessary for flight Anchiornis also had a more avian wrist than other non avialan theropods The authors first thought that Anchiornis could fly or glide However further finds showed that the wings of Anchiornis while well developed were short when compared to later species like Microraptor with relatively short primary feathers that had rounded symmetrical tips unlike the pointed aerodynamically proportioned feathers of Microraptor So the animal could glide but probably not fly

Anchiornis has long hind legs suggesting a fast running lifestyle However the legs and even feet and toes of Anchiornis were covered in feathers making it unlikely that Anchiornis was a capable ground runner A tree based glider is the probable life style

umadija is a geographical region in Serbia The area was heavily forested hence the name The city of Kragujevac is the center of the region and the administrative center of the umadija District in Central Serbia

umadija is located between rivers Sava and Danube in the north river Velika Morava in the east river Zapadna Morava in the south and Kolubara Ljig and Diina in the west According to some interpretations the northern border of umadija lay between Avala and Kosmaj mountain According to that view the capital of Serbia Belgrade does not belong to this region

During the 18th century the forests of umadija were the refuge for the Hajduks that fought against Ottoman occupation The first Serbian uprising in 1804 was led by national hero Karaore The second Serbian uprising in 1815 was led by Milo Obrenovi who successfully repelled the Turkish forces and by 1830 Serbia had gained its full autonomy Because of Milos efforts and negotiations Serbia was finally an independent state after centuries under Ottoman reign

Between 1922 and 1929 one of the administrative units of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was named umadijska Oblast It roughly included territory of present day umadija District with its administrative seat in Kragujevac which is the seat of the modern district as well

Some of the large cities and towns in umadija are

A padlock is a type of portable lock that has a U shaped shackle that will not come apart from the body of the lock unless the correct key is inserted or the correct combination is dialed The U shape of the lock allows for a wide variety of uses Typically the padlock is used to lock two things together for example a door and its frame two or more chains or a chain and a fixed object Padlocks are not recommended for high security applications because the shackle is easily cut with a bolt cutter or hacksaw Some newer padlocks have hardened boron alloy shackles or shrouded shackles to make them more difficult to cut

The combination padlock is usually made with a metal can with three tumblers inside connected to a dial on the front The mechanism is very similar to that used in safes When the correct combination is entered the notches on the tumblers line up and allow a latch to fall into the notches releasing the shackle The laminated padlock is constructed from a series of metal plates that are riveted together The shackle of most padlocks is made from hardened steel although more expensive padlocks may have boron alloy steels to make them more difficult to cut Inexpensive padlocks usually have a shackle made of ordinary steel Corrosion resistant padlocks usually have a brass or stainless steel shackle The material that the shackle is made of is usually stamped in the center of the shackle For example a hardened steel shackle will be stamped HARDENED or a boron alloy shackle will be stamped BORON ALLOY The shackle is usually plated with another metal such as chrome to protect it from rust The body of the padlock is usually also plated Brass and stainless steel padlocks do not need plating although they are sometimes plated anyway for appearance

The stamp on the shackle indicates what material it is made of The most common are

A market economy is economy in which the prices of the products and services are chosen in a free price system that is decided by supply and demand It began around the late 18th century after the Industrial Revolution A key work was Adam Smiths The Wealth of Nations 1776

Market economics has been praised and widely used because of its efficiency However it has also been criticized for its selfishness and the difference between the rich and poor In the real world market economies are not purely market economies as societies and governments control them in some ways instead of market forces The expression free market economy is sometimes used as the same as market economy Nobel Prize in Economics winner Ludwig von Mises said that a market economy is still a market economy even if the government joins in in pricing

Epidexipteryx is a genus of small maniraptoran dinosaurs known from one fossil specimen in Beijing Epidexipteryx is the earliest known example of ornamental feathers in the fossil record It is a small maniraptoran dinosaur from the Middle or Upper Jurassic age Daohugou Beds of Inner Mongolia China

It is known from a well preserved partial skeleton that includes four long feathers on the tail composed of a central rachis and vanes However unlike in modern style tail feathers the vanes were not branched but made up of a single ribbon like sheet Epidexipteryx also preserved a covering of simpler body feathers They are unique in that some appear to arise from a membranous structure

In all the skeleton of Epidexipteryx hui measures 25 centimeters in length and the authors estimated a weight of 164 grams smaller than most other early dinobirds

The skull of Epidexipteryx is also unique in a number of features It had teeth only in the front of the jaws with unusually long front teeth angled forward a feature only seen in Masiakasaurus among other theropods The tail of Epidexipteryx bore unusual vertebrae towards the tip which resembled the feather anchoring pygostyle of modern birds and some oviraptors

Despite its close relationship to avialan birds Epidexipteryx appears to have lacked wing feathers and so it could not fly Zhang et al suggest that unless Epidexipteryx evolved from flying ancestors and subsequently lost its wings this may indicate that advanced display feathers on the tail may have predated flying or gliding flight

There is uncertainty about the age of the Daohugou Beds in which this fossil was found Various papers have placed the fossils here anywhere from the Middle Jurassic to the Lower Cretaceous The age of this formation has implications for the relationship between similar dinosaurs as well as for the origin of birds in general A Middle Jurassic age would mean that the bird like dinosaurs in the Daohugou beds are older than the first bird Archaeopteryx which was late Jurassic in age Until this question is decided the significance of Epidexipteryx is not clear

The Foxtrot or Slow foxtrot is an English ballroom dance which developed from American band music It is now one of the international standard ballroom dances All ballroom dance competitions controlled by the World Dance Council include the Foxtrot

All the standard ballroom dances had their origins abroad but were adapted and modified by English dancers into their modern style The Waltz came from Germany around 1810 The Tango came from Argentina The Foxtrot and Quickstep were greatly influenced by American music

An American dance called the Boston arrived in England about 1903 This had fairly slow gliding steps It is a characteristic of the Foxtrot that in the basic steps unlike the other dances the feet slide past each other rather than coming together The Boston seems to have been the first dance to move the feet in this way The Boston also was the first ballroom dance to be done with feet parallel

The Boston like much else was finished off by the First World War Crowded dance floors in wartime left no room for it and new musical imports arrived from America

Ragtime and jazz came to Europe and were great sensations Both the music and the many craze dances contributed After the war the big bands of Paul Whiteman took centre stage He played arrangers jazz meaning the band played from charts rather than by ear Whitemans bands were hugely successful 

The decade between 1910 and 1920 said one writer was the period in which America went dance madp369 From 1912 through 1914 said another over one hundred new dances found their way in and out of our fashionable ballroomsp76 These are a few examples The Shimmy The Grind The Turkey Trot The Bunny Hug The Texas Tommy The Cakewalk Almost all these dances originated in the black community in the United States and some moved over into white societyp95

During the 1920s English professional dancers and dance teachers set out to find ways of dancing to the new music In their opinion what was needed was separate dances for different tempos So what happened was that the Foxtrot which had started off as a mid tempo dance influenced by ragtime gradually split into two dances a Slow foxtrot and a quick foxtrot The difference in tempo allowed the dances to become in time different in style as well as music The Quickstep was influenced by the Charleston and the Slow foxtrot by ideas from the Boston The syncopation which is still common in the quickstep is an example of ragtime influence on modern dancing

Where did the name foxtrot come from It is often said that Foxtrot took its name from its inventor the vaudeville actor Harry Fox however the exact origins are not clear The dance was premiered in 1914 quickly catching the eye of the talented husband and wife duo Vernon and Irene Castle who lent the dance its signature grace and style

WC Handys Memphis Blues was said to be the inspiration for the Foxtrot The Castles music director would play the Memphis Blues during breaks from the fast paced Castle Walk and One step The Castles were intrigued by the rhythm They introduced the Bunny Hug in a magazine article They went abroad and in mid ocean sent a wireless to the magazine to change the Bunny Hug to the Foxtrotp226

Symphony No 8 in E flat major by Gustav Mahler is one of the largest choral works in classical music It needs a huge orchestra to play it and a huge choir to sing Because so many performers are needed it is often called Symphony of a Thousand but that is not a name that Mahler gave to it

Mahler worked very hard at it composing it in quite a short time at Maiernigg in southern Austria in the summer of 1906 It was the last of Mahlers works that was to be given its first performance in his lifetime The symphony was given its first performance in Munich on 12 September 1910

Symphonies are usually pieces of music played just by an orchestra but Beethoven started a tradition of having singing in symphonies his Ninth Symphony is the famous one with the Ode to Joy in the last movement Mahler took up this idea of combining singing with symphony His Symphonies Nos 2 3 and 4 all have singing in them The next three are just for orchestra but in No 8 he uses singing again

Symphony No 8 is very unusual because he does not have the usual three or four movements with traditional forms such as sonata form The whole symphony is in two parts Part I is based on the Latin text of a ninth century Christian hymn for Pentecost Veni creator spiritus Part II is in German The words come from the closing scene of Goethes Faust 

The two parts have a common idea the idea of being saved through the power of love Musically Mahler does this by sharing tunes throughout the symphony The symphony expresses the confidence of the eternal human spirit

For many years after Mahlers death it was not often performed It is of course a very expensive symphony to perform because of the vast numbers of musicians needed It also needs to be performed in a very large concert hall Today it is played more often The 100th anniversary of its first performance will be celebrated in July 2010in the opening concert of the BBC Proms is the Royal Albert Hall London

Opinions about the symphony have been divided Some people did not think the optimism expressed in the music was really convincing Other people have said it is one of the greatest musical expressions of humanity

Simon Boccanegra is an opera by Giuseppe Verdi It is divided into a prologue and three acts The libretto is by Francesco Maria Piave The story was based on a play Simn Bocanegra by Antonio Garca Gutirrez

Simon Boccanegra was first performed at Teatro La Fenice Venice on 12 March 1857 It was not very successful and many years later Verdi made a lot of changes to it He was helped by the writer Arrigo Boito who made changes to the plot The new version was first performed at La Scala Milan on 24 March 1881 This is the version that is normally performed today

 The story of the opera 

The story is supposed to take place in the middle of the 14th century in Genoa Genoa is now a town in Italy but in those days Italy was not yet one country and Genoa like Venice was a small republic ruled by a Doge Until the time of this story the Doge had always been chosen from one of the rich patricians The ordinary common people could not be chosen to be the Doge

At the beginning of the story Fiesco is the Doge of Genoa He has a daughter Maria Maria has fallen in love with Simon Boccanegra who is a plebeian so he would not be important enough to be allowed to marry her even though he has become a hero because he has fought lots of pirates Simon and Maria had a child a young girl After she was born she was given to an old woman to look after but one day the old woman died and the small child wandered off alone She was found wandering by the sea shore by Count Grimaldi who took her and looked after her as if she were his own child

No one knows what has happened to the child Count Grimaldi does not know who she is He thinks she is an orphan

When the opera begins Paolo the leader of the Plebeian party persuades Pietro to encourage the plebeians to vote for Simon Boccanegra as the new doge of Genoa Boccanegra arrives and agrees that he would be doge if he were chosen Simon thinks this would make Fiesco allow him to marry Maria For the past three months Fiesco has locked his daughter in the palace because she had had a child with Simon 

Maria dies Fiesco now laments the death of his daughter Simon begs Fiesco to forgive him Fiesco does not tell him Maria has just died He promises to forgive him only if Simon lets him have his granddaughter Simon explains he cannot because the child has disappeared He goes into Marias room and finds she is dead The people sing happily because Simon is the new Doge

The story of Act I takes place 25 years later Simon is still the Doge He has sent many of his enemies into exile and taken away their property Count Grimaldi is one of the people who has been exiled In the Grimaldi castle Fiesco is calling himself Andrea Grimaldi so that people do not know who he is He is plotting with Simons enemies to overthrow him He does not know that his granddaughter is the young lady called Amelia Grimaldi who is living in the castle 

At the beginning of Act I we see Amelia singing a beautiful song about the morning and the sea and the stars She has a lover Gabriele Adorno When he arrives she warns him of the dangers of political plotting The news is brought that the Doge is coming Amelia is worried that the Doge will make her marry Paolo so she asks Gabriele to ask Andrea immediately for permission for them to marry Fiesco agrees He tells Gabriele that she was a poor orphan who had been found Gabriele says that he does not care about that so Fiesco blesses the marriage

Simon enters He tells her that Count Grimaldi is forgiven and can return home He asks her whether she would like to marry Paolo but she refuses She tells him that she is an orphan and she shows him a locket with a picture of her mother Simon realizes that Amelia is his long lost daughter They are very happy to have found one another When Paolo enters Simon tells him he cannot marry her Paolo is furious and decides to kidnap Amelia 

In the next scene we see Simon surrounded by the plebeian and patrician members of his Council They are discussing whether they should make peace with the republic of Venice Suddenly a crowd enters shouting for death to Simon They are chasing Gabriele Gabriele confesses that he killed Lorenzino for trying to kidnap Amelia As Lorenzino lay dying he had said that he had been told by an important person to kidnap her  Adorno guesses that Simon must have ordered the kidnapping He is about to attack him when Amelia rushes in and stops the fight  Simon arrests Gabriele He realizes that Paolo must be the real kidnapper and makes everybody curse him Simon and his daughter are left alone on stage at the end of the act

Paolo is frightened He is furious with Simon and decides he must poison him Fiesco and Gabriele are brought in He tells Fiesco he can be free if he murders Simon Fiesco refuses Just as Fiesco and Gabriele are about to leave Paolo asks Gabriele whether he knows Amelia is here in the palace having an affair with Simon Gabriele is furious When Amelia enters she denies the story She tells Gabriele she loves him and tries to persuade him to leave but Simon is coming and Gabriele hides

Amelia tells Simon that she would die for Gabriele Simon agrees to pardon him He drinks from a poisoned glass of wine which Paolo had put on the table and falls asleep Gabriele tries to kill him but Amelia stops him Simon wakes up He tells Gabriele that Amelia is his daughter Gabriele begs Simon for forgiveness and promises he will fight for him 

This takes place in a great hall which looks out on the harbour Fiesco has been set free but Paolo is condemned to death for leading the uprising against the Doge Paolo tells Fiesco that he has poisoned Simon Fiesco goes to Simon who is now dying Simon recognizes his old enemy who he thought was dead He is happy to tell him that Amelia is his long lost granddaughter Fiesco feels terribly sad and tells Simon about the poison Gabriele and Amelia have just got married They find her father and grandfather are now friends Simon asks for Gabriele to be the next Doge when he dies Fiesco goes to the window and announces to the crowd that Gabriele Adorno is now the new Doge and that Simon Boccanegra is dead

A geyser is a hot spring which shoots out water and steam They erupt when when pressure has built up often at regular intervals There are about a thousand geysers around the world About half are in Yellowstone National Park Wyoming United States

Geysers are made in special geological conditions Only a few places on Earth have these conditions Because of this geysers are not very common One place is the Yellowstone National Park which is the remains of a gigantic volcano Another is Iceland which sits on top of the Mid Atlantic Ridge where new Earths crust is formed 

Geysers are often near active volcanos This is because the geyser is caused by magma Surface water usually goes down to about convert2000mft There it mixes with hot rocks The pressurized water begins to boil When it is pressured enough hot water and steam burst out of the geyser

Individual geysers do not last forever but systems of geysers last as long as the geological situation continues The oldest individual geysers are only a few thousand years old Geysers are usually near volcanic areas As the water boils the pressure increases This forces hot steam and water to the surface through the geyser Geysers are usually made because of three things that are around volcanoes

Most importantly the temperatures near the bottom of the geyser become high enough to start boiling the water Steam bubbles come out of the top of the column They burst through the geysers vent Some water flows or splashes out This makes the weight of the column of water and the pressure on the water below less When this pressure is released the hot water turns into steam It boils violently

The moon has eruptions which are called geysers There the eruption takes place from vapor only The liquid part is not present there They are more easily seen because of the bits of dust and ice carried by the vapor Water vapor streams have been seen near the south pole of Saturns moon Enceladus Nitrogen eruptions have been seen on Neptunes moon Triton Carbon dioxide eruptions from the southern polar ice cap of Mars have also been seen

Market capitalization is a measurement of size of a business corporation It is equal to the price of one share of stock times the number of shares of stock in a public company Owning stock in a company is owning a part of the company Market capitalization shows the public opinion of a companys value The total market capitalization of all publicly traded companies in the world was US512 trillion in January 2007 In May 2008 to rose to US575 trillion By September 2008 the market cap had dropping a little more than US40 trillion 

Market capitalization represents the public opinion of the value of a companys equity A public corporation including all of its assets may be bought and sold as stock These purchases and sales will define the price of the companys share price Market capitalization is the share price times by the number of shares in issue This provides a total value for the companys shares and the value the company

Some companies have stock that is privately owned and not publicly traded Many Stock markets adjust the market cap on the value of the publicly traded part of the company In this case market capitalization is based on the publicly traded stocks

Note that market capitalization is a market estimate of a companys value It is based how the public believes the company will perform in the future There are many things that can affect the stock price These include economic conditions and mergers and acquisitions

In the past companies were separated into large cap mid cap and small cap New categorizes micro cap and nano cap have been added There are general guidelines to know what category a company is in These guidelines are adjusted over time due to changes in the market and the economy For example 1 billion was a large market cap in 1950 but it is not very large now 

Different numbers are used by different stock markets There is no official definition of the exact cutoffs They also may be done by percentiles rather than fixed cutoffs

Vernon and Irene Castle were a husband and wife team of ballroom dancers of the early 20th century They were famous for developing and promoting dancing in the period of the First World War

Vernon Castle was born William Vernon Blyth in Norwich Norfolk England Irene Castle was born Irene Foote the daughter of a prominent physician in New Rochelle New York 

Vernon chose Castle as a stage name when he first performed as a comic because his sister already used the family name Blyth He had already taken the name before Irene met him in 1910p33

Vernon was initially trained to become a civil engineer He moved to New York in 1906 There he became established as a comic actor and conjuror

Irene studied dancing and performed in several amateur theatricals before meeting Vernon in 1910 The next year over her fathers objections the two were married The English born Vernon had already established himself as a dancer in comedic roles His specialty was playing a gentleman drunk who elegantly fell about the stage while trying to hide his condition 

After their marriage Irene joined Vernon in The Hen Pecks a production in which he was a featured player The two then travelled together to Paris to perform in a dance revue The show closed quickly but the couple were hired as a dance act by the Caf de Paris Performing the latest American dances the Castles were soon the rage of Parisian society They introduced American ragtime dances such as the Turkey Trot and the Grizzly Bear

When the Castles returned to the US in 1912 their success was repeated on a far wider scale Making their New York debut at a branch of the Cafe de Paris the duo were soon in demand on stage in vaudeville and in motion pictures In 1914 the couple opened a dancing school in New York called Castle House a nightclub called Castles by the Sea on the Boardwalk in Long Beach New York and a restaurant the Sans Souci

In addition to cabaret the Castles also became staples of Broadway The Castles greatest success was on Broadway in Irving Berlins debut musical Watch Your Step In this extravaganza the couple refined and popularized the Foxtrot which vaudeville comedian Harry Fox may have invented After its New York run Watch Your Step toured through 1916

The Castles helped remove the stigma of vulgarity from close dancing The Castles performances often set to ragtime and jazz rhythms also popularized African American music among well heeled whites Irenes fashion sense too started national trends Her elegant yet simple flowing gowns were often featured in fashion magazines She also introduced American women to the bobthe short hairstyle favored by flappers in the 1920s

The Castles appeared in a newsreel called Social and Theatrical Dancing in 1914 and wrote a bestselling instructional book Modern Dancing later the same year The pair also starred in a feature film called The Whirl of Life which was well received by critics and public alike As the couples celebrity increased in the mid 1910s Irene Castle became a major fashion trendsetter with her bobbed hair and shorter skirts Her chic wardrobe was supplied almost exclusively by the couturire Lucile but Irene also designed some of her clothes herself 

The slim elegant Castles were trendsetters in many ways they travelled with a black orchestra had an openly lesbian manager and were animal rights advocates long before it became a public issue

The Castles endorsed Victor Records and Victrolas They issued records by the Castle House Orchestra led by James Reese Europe a pioneering figure in Black music They also lent their names to advertising for other products from cigars and cosmetics to shoes and hats They were in short personalities of the modern kind who had a gift for self publicity They were as famous as any film stars of the day

Vernon returned to the UK to become a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps during World War I Flying over the Western Front he shot down two aircraft and was awarded the French Croix de Guerre in 1917 He was posted to Canada to train new pilots and then promoted to Captain and posted to the US to train American pilots 

While flying at Benbrook Field near Fort Worth Texas he took emergency action shortly after take off to avoid another aircraft His plane stalled and he was unable to recover control Vernon was the only casualty Fatally injured he died soon after the crash on death date and age1918215188752 Irene paid tribute to Vernon in her memoir My Husband 1919

Irene starred solo in about a dozen silent films between 1917 and 1924 and appeared in several stage productions before retiring from show business She married three more times to Robert Treman Frederic McLaughlin and George Enzinger 

In 1939 her life with Vernon was turned into a movie The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle produced by RKO and starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Irene served as a technical advisor on the film but clashed with Rogers who refused to short bob or darken her hair Irene also objected to white actor Walter Brennan playing their servant Walter was BLACK

For the rest of her life Irene was a staunch animal rights activist ultimately founding the Illinois animal shelter Orphans of the Storm which is still active 

Irene died death date and age19691251893417 Vernon and Irene Castle are interred together in the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx New York There is a large monument to Vernon Castle near the site of his crash in Benbrook Texas
