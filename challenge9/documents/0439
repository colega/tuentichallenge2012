Spacewar is one of the first known video games It was released in 1962 In this game the player has to shoot the other spaceships while flying around a star The ships shoot missiles which were unaffected by the gravity Each ship had only a few missiles and only a little bit of fuel The hyperspace could be used to avoid being hit by a missile but the ship would reappear at a random place The more the player used hyperspace the bigger the chance that the spaceship would explode

Giotto di Bondone usually known as Giotto was an Italian painter and architect from Florence He is generally thought of as the first in a line of great artists of the Italian Renaissance 

Giovanni Villani who lived at the same time as Giotto wrote that he was the king of painters who drew all his figures as if they were alive Villani says that because he was so clever the city of Florence gave him a salary

In the 16th century the biographer Giorgio Vasari says that Giotto changed painting from the Byzantine style of other artists of his day and brought to life the great art of painting as it was made by the later Renaissance painters like Leonardo da Vinci This was because Giotto drew his figures from life rather than copying the style them from old well known pictures in the way that the Byzantine artists like Cimabue and Duccio did

Giottos greatest work is the decoration of the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua finished around 1305 The building is sometimes called the Arena Chapel because it is on the site of an Ancient Roman arena This fresco series shows the life of the Virgin and the life of Christ It is thought of as one of the greatest masterpieces of the Early Renaissance 

Although Vasari wrote about Giottos life it is not known how many of the stories are true because Vasari was writing more than 200 years after Giotto died Only two things are known for certain It is known that in 1334 Giotto was chosen by the commune of Florence to design the bell tower next to Florence Cathedral which was being built at that time It is also known for certain that Giotto painted the Arena Chapel But no one can be certain where he was born who his teacher was what he looked like whether he really painted the famous frescos at Assisi or where he was buried when he died 

Giotto was probably born in a hilltop farmhouse perhaps at Colle di Romagnano or Romignano He was the son of a well respected man named Bondone His name Giotto might have been a nickname from Ambrogiotto or Angelotto The year of his death is 1337 but the year of his birth is based on a poem by Antonio Pucci the town crier of Florence who said that Giotto was seventy when he died Some people think that Pucci just used seventy because it fitted the rhyme of his poem and that perhaps Giotto was a quite different age when he died 

In his Lives of the Artists Giorgio Vasari tells the story of how Giotto was a shepherd boy a merry and intelligent child who was loved by all who knew him One day the great Florentine painter Cimabue passed by and saw him drawing pictures of his sheep on a rock They were so lifelike that Cimabue asked Bondone if he could take the boy as an apprentice Many art historians think this story is just a legend They think that Giottos family was quite rich and they moved to Florence where Giotto was sent to Cimabues workshop as an apprentice 

Vasari tells several stories to show how clever Giotto was and what a sense of humour he had Vasari writes that when Cimabue was away from the workshop Giotto painted a fly on the face of the painting that his master was working on When Cimabue came back he tried several times to brush the fly off 

Vasari also tells the story that the Pope wanted to see if Giotto would be a good artists to paint some important pictures The Pope sent a messenger asking Giotto to send him back a small picture Instead of doing a painting which would take many days Giotto drew in red paint a circle that was so perfect that it seemed as though it was drawn using a pair of compasses Giotto told the messenger to give that to the Pope

Giottos master Cimabue was one of the two most famous painters of Tuscany He worked in Florence while the other famous painter Duccio worked mainly in Siena Around 1280 Giotto and Cimabue went to Rome where there were several fresco painters The most famous painter in Rome was Pietro Cavallini The famous sculptor and architect from Florence Arnolfo di Cambio was also working in Rome Giotto would have seen the paintings and sculpture by these different artists Pietro Cavallinis paintings and Arnolfos sculpture was far more realistic and three dimensional than the paintings by Giottos teacher Cimabue 

From Rome Giottos teacher Cimabue went to Assisi to paint several large frescoes at the Upper Church of the newly built Basilica of St Francis of Assisi Through the 19th centuryand for much of the 20th century it was believed that Giotto had also painted a famous series of frescos in the Upper Church These pictures show the Life of St Francis From 1912 some art historians who studied these frescos more closely decided that they were the work of several different artists probably from Rome and that probably none of the pictures were by Giotto Nowadays most art historians agree with this but some books and some websites continue to say that these paintings are by Giotto All the papers that belonged to the monastery were destroyed by Napoleons soldiers so there is no record of which artist was paid to do the job

Vasari wrote that Giottos earliest works were for the Dominican Friars at the Church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence These paintings include a fresco of the Annunciation and the enormous suspended Crucifix which is about 5 metres high painted in about 1290 In 1312 a rich Florentine gentleman called Ricuccio Pucci left money in his will so that a lamp could be kept burning before the crucifix by the illustrious painter Giotto

In 1287 when he was about 20 Giotto married Ricevuta di Lapo del Pela known as Ciuta The couple had many children perhaps eight One of the sons Francesco became a painter Giottos fame as a painter spread He was called to work in Rome Padua and Rimini where his Crucifix can be seen in the Church of St Francis Giotto became rich enough to buy land in the wealthy city of Florence This probably means that he was the master of a large workshop

Giottos most famous works are the fresco paintings in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua These were painted sometime between 1303 and 1310 The Scrovegni Chapel is often called the Arena Chapel because it is on the site of an Roman arena 

Giotto was commissioned by a rich Paduan man called Enrico degli Scrovegni Enrico built the chapel and had it painted as a place to pray for the soul of his dead father It was next to a very old palace that Enrico ws restoring to live in The palace has gone now but the chapel is still standing The outside of the building is very plain pinkish red bricks 

The inside of the chapel is also very simple It is long with a chancel at one end where a priest can say the mass an arched roof and windows down one side The walls have been painted with three tiers of pictures The theme in the pictures is Gods Salvation of people through Jesus Christ 

In the usual way for churches of that date the wall above the main door has a large painting of the Last Judgement At the other end of the building on either side of the chancel archway are paintings of the Annunciation One side shows the Virgin Mary and the other side show the Angel Gabriel who is bringing her the message that she will have a son Jesus 

Around the walls starting at the top layer are scenes which tell the life of the Virgin Mary Under them in two layers are the stories of the life of Jesus There are 37 scenes altogether 

Giottos master Cimabue painted in a Medieval style But Giottos paintings look quite different The writer Giorgio Vasari says that Giotto brought about a complete change in painting with a more natural style Giotto would have seen the paintings of Pietro Cavallini and some Ancient Roman sculpture on his visit to Rome He also saw the sculpture of Arnolfo di Cambio who worked in Florence The style of these sculptured figures was solid and natural not elongated like most Medieval sculptured and painted figures 

The figures that Giotto painted are solid and three dimensional They have anatomy faces and actions that look very natural because they have been drawn from looking at real people The clothes of the figures are not arranged to form a beautiful pattern like the clothes in Cimabues paintings They fit the figures and hang in a natural way like real clothes This more natural way of showing people was started by Pietro Cavallini but Giotto took the new ideas much further 

In the paintings around the walls of the Scrovegni Chapel each scene looks like a shallow stage with actors on it There are always some buildings or landscape such as a rocky hill so that the viewer can see where the action is happening The figures in each scene are carefully arranged so that the viewer can imagine that they are right there taking part in the action 

The figures are not just shown with natural bodies clothing and action Giotto is a brilliant story teller because he shows the emotions of the characters in each painting in both their faces and their gestures 

A famous English critic of the 1800s John Ruskin said that while Giotto painted the Madonna and St Joseph and the Christ Child he also painted them to look like an ordinary Mamma Papa and Baby 

Giotto had pupils who copied his style Many other artists were influence by him These painters include Guariento Giusto de Menabuoi Jacopo Avanzi and Altichiero In the next hundred years there were many churches and chapels painted with scenes like the ones that Gitto painted The Scrovegni Chapel paintings were so famous that many other artists such as Michelangelo who lived 200 years later made drawing or copies of them 

In 1320 Giotto finished the Stefaneschi Triptych now in the Vatican Museum for Cardinal Jacopo who also commissioned him the decoration of St Peters apse with a cycle of frescoes destroyed during the 16th century renovation According to Vasari Giotto remained in Rome for six years subsequently receiving numerous commissions in Italy and in the Papal seat at Avignon though some of these works are now recognized to be by other artists

In 1328 after completing the Baroncelli Polyptych he was called by King Robert of Anjou to Naples where he remained with a group of pupils until 1333 In Naples few of his works have survived a fragment of a fresco portraying the Lamentation of Christ in the church of Santa Chiara and the Illustrious Men painted on the windows of the Santa Barbara Chapel of Castel Nuovo In 1332 King Robert named him first court painter with a yearly pension

After Naples Giotto stayed for while in Bologna where he painted a Polyptych for the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli and according to the sources a lost decoration for the Chapel in the Cardinal Legates Castle

In 1334 Giotto was appointed chief architect to Florence Cathedral of which the Campanile bears his name but was not completed to his design

Before 1337 he was in Milan with Azzone Visconti though no trace of works by him remain in the city His last known work is the decoration of Podest Chapel in the Bargello Florence

In his final years Giotto had become friends with Boccaccio and Sacchetti who featured him in their stories In The Divine Comedy Dante acknowledged the greatness of his living contemporary through the words of a painter in Purgatorio Cimabue believed that he held the fieldIn painting and now Giotto has the cry So the fame of the former is obscure

Giotto died in January of 1337 According to Vasari Giotto was buried in Santa Maria del Fiore the Cathedral of Florence on the left of the entrance and with the spot marked by a white marble plaque According to other sources he was buried in the Church of Santa Reparata These apparently contradictory reports are explained by the fact that the remains of Santa Reparata lie directly beneath the Cathedral and the church continued in use while the construction of the cathedral was proceeding in the early 14th century 

During an excavation in the 1970s bones were discovered beneath the paving of Santa Reparata at a spot close to the location given by Vasari but unmarked on either level Forensic examination of the bones by anthropologist Francesco Mallegni and a team of experts in 2000 brought to light some facts that seemed to confirm that they were those of a painter particularly the range of chemicals including arsenic and lead both commonly found in paint that the bones had absorbed

The bones were those of a very short man of little over four feet tall who may have suffered from a form of congenital dwarfism This supports a tradition at the Church of Santa Croce that a dwarf who appears in one of the frescoes is a self portrait of Giotto On the other hand a man wearing a white hat who appears in the Last Judgement at Padua is also said to be a portrait of Giotto The appearance of this man conflicts with the image in Santa Croce

Vasari drawing on a description by Boccaccio who was a friend of Giotto says of him that there was no uglier man in the city of Florence and indicates that his children were also plain in appearance There is a story that Dante visited Giotto while he was painting the Arena Chapel and seeing the artists children underfoot asked how a man who painted such beautiful pictures could create such plain children to which Giotto who according to Vasari was always a wit replied I made them in the dark

Forensic reconstruction of the skeleton at Santa Reperata showed a short man with a very large head a large hooked nose and one eye more prominent than the other The bones of the neck indicated that the man spent a lot of time with his head tilted backwards The front teeth were worn in a way consistent with frequently holding a brush between the teeth The man was about 70 at the time of death

While the Italian researchers were convinced that the body belonged to Giotto and it was reburied with honour near the grave of Brunelleschi others have been highly skeptical

Note while the reproductions of paintings at external sites are valuable attributions may be misleading Any website that shows without question the frescoes of the Upper Church of St Francis of Assisi as being the work of Giotto is ignoring modern scholarship on the matter Any website that claims that Giotto was placed in charge of the decoration of the Upper Church or was selected as the most suitable artist for its decoration is making an unsourced claim If records of the commissions existed they have been destroyed along with other documents belonging to the church at that period

The Moura solar photovoltaic power station is located in the municipality of Moura in the interior region of Alentejo Portugal and will have an installed capacity of 62 MWp The first stage of construction should be finished in 2008 and the second and final stage is scheduled for 2010 Together with the construction of the power station a solar panel factory is currently being built and there are plans for a research lab dedicated to solar energy

Jrmie is a city in southwest Haiti It is the capital city of the GrandAnse Dpartement

Jrmie is also called the City of Poets because of the many writers poets and historians that were born or live there such as Etzer Vilaire and mile Roumer The father of the French writer Alexandre Dumas pre General Thomas Alexandre Dumas was born at Madre near Jrmie

The town was founded in 1756 when the country was the French colony of Saint Domingue It was built where there was a small fishing town called Trou Jrmie

The city is on the north coast of the Southern Peninsula on a small bay It is among low mountains and almost isolated from the rest of the country about 280 km south of the Haitian capital Port au Prince To the southeast of the city is the River Grande Anse

It is also the chief town of an arrondissement with the same name The arrondissement has five communes Jrmie Abricots Bonbon Chambellan and Moron

Jeremie is an important Haitian port bananas are send to other countries from this port

There are several interesting places to visit and see in Jrmie and near the city Some of them are

The 1979 Three Mile Island accident at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant in Pennsylvania was the single most important event in the fifty year history of nuclear power regulation in the United States Many people have seen the event as a turning point for the nuclear power industry in the United States The Three Mile Island power station is near Harrisburg Pennsylvania The accident began on Wednesday March 28 1979 and resulted in a partial core meltdown in Unit 2 of the nuclear power plant Unit 2s pressurized water reactor was of 900 MWe capacity 

The chain of events that led to the crisis at the TMI plant included several minor equipment failures that operator errors drastically compounded resulting in a major accident The Three Mile Island accident is largely seen as a failure of crisis management According to one reviewer of the book  Reactor operators were not trained to deal with accident conditions and the NRC had not established effective communication with utilities Moreover once the accident occurred the lines of authority proved to be ill defined The public received conflicting reports that caused needless panic and evacuations It was these systemic weaknesses in the regulatory system that allowed gifted people to make the mistakes they did 

Large portions of the TMI 2 reactor core melted though the fact that a partial meltdown had occurred did not become clear until 1985 The greatest source of concern during the TMI crisis was a hydrogen bubble that formed in the top of the pressure vessel which held the core Although opinions differed some reactor experts feared that over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or less likely explosive by combining with free oxygen in the vessel If the bubble burned or exploded it could rupture the pressure vessel and force the damaged reactor core into the containment building The loss of the vessel would not make a breach of containment inevitable but it would increase the risk of a disastrous release of radiation 

In the end the Three Mile Island accident though it caused a grave crisis did not produce a public health disaster In the face of a core meltdown the pressure vessel held and there was no breach of the plants containment structure Only tiny amounts of the most dangerous forms of volatile radiation escaped to the atmosphere The TMI 2 cleanup took 11 years and cost about US1 billion

J Samuel Walker suggests that the TMI accident incited widespread criticism of nuclear power technology the nuclear industry and the NRC Critics faulted the industry and the NRC for their poor performance both before and after the accident The international attention garnered by the crisis redoubled the determination of and enhanced the credibility of the anti nuclear movement Arguably the United States nuclear industry has never recovered

Walker reports that studies looking for long term radiation effects resulting from the accident have reached conflicting conclusions but it seems that any increase in cancers is slight enough to have occurred by chance

The Windscale fire was a devastating fire in Britains first nuclear reactor at Windscale in 1957 The fire spread radioactive fallout over hundreds of miles Some of the most dangerous contamination was kept secret and its effects only came to light years later At the back of the reactor ruptured fuel cartridges containing uranium are still jammed in the fire damaged core awaiting safe removal Official estimates are that up to a hundred people may have died from the contamination The cleanup cost over a hundred million pounds

Alan can be any of the following

The Tokaimura nuclear accident was Japans worst nuclear radiation accident It took place at a uranium reprocessing facility in Tokaimura northeast of Tokyo Japan on 30 September 1999 The accident occurred in a very small fuel preparation plant operated by JCO

The direct cause of the accident was some workers putting uranyl nitrate solution containing about 166 kg of uranium which exceeded the critical mass into a precipitation tank The tank was not designed to dissolve this type of solution and was not designed to prevent such accidents to happen As a result three workers were exposed to neutron radiation doses in excess of allowable limits Two of these workers later died

Many emergency workers and nearby residents were hospitalized and hundreds of thousands of others were forced to remain indoors for 24 hours

Nuclear accidents in Japan include the following major cases 

Nuclear energy policy is a national and international policy concerning some or all aspects of nuclear energy such as mining for nuclear fuel extraction and processing of nuclear fuel from the ore electricity generation by nuclear power enriching and storing spent nuclear fuel and nuclear fuel reprocessing Since nuclear energy and nuclear weapons technologies are closely related military aspirations can act as a factor in energy policy decisions The fear of nuclear proliferation influences some international nuclear energy policies 

The use of nuclear energy is limited to a relatively small number of countries in the world As of 2007 only 31 countries or 16 of the 191 United Nations Member States operated nuclear power plants Countries that rely most on nuclear energy were France Lithuania Belgium Bulgaria Slovakia and Sweden Ukraine and South Korea The largest producer of nuclear capacity was the USA with 28 of worldwide capacity followed by France and Japan In 2000 there were 438 commercial nuclear generating units throughout the world with a total capacity of about 351 gigawatts 

Following the 2011 Fukushima I nuclear accidents China Germany Switzerland Israel Malaysia Thailand United Kingdom and the Philippines are reviewing their nuclear power programs Indonesia and Vietnam still plan to build nuclear power plants Countries such as Australia Austria Denmark Greece Ireland Luxembourg Portugal Israel Malaysia New Zealand North Korea and Norway remain opposed to nuclear power

Australia produces no nuclear power Plans to review whether the country should develop nuclear power were abandoned after Kevin Rudd who opposed the move was elected prime minister in 2007

As of 2006 Finlands nuclear power program has four nuclear reactors The first of these came into operation in 1977 They now provide 27 of Finlands electricity 

The third Olkiluoto reactor will be the new European Pressurized Reactor Scheduled to go on line in 2011 it will have a power output of 1600 MWe 

Construction of Olkiluoto 3 started in August 2005 Two and a half years later the project is over two years behind schedule and at least 50 over budget the loss for the provider being estimated at 15 billion

After the oil crisis of the early 1970s the French government decided in 1974 to move towards self sufficiency in electricity production primarily through the construction of nuclear power stations France today produces around 781 of its electricity through nuclear power Because France produces an overall electricity surplus it exports nuclear produced energy Some of this goes to countries which are ostensibly against the use of nuclear energy such as Germany The Board of Electricit de France has approved construction of a 1630 MWe European Pressurized Reactor or EPR at Flamanville Normandy Construction is expected to begin in late 2007 with completion in 2012

In the 1970s an anti nuclear movement in France consisting of citizens groups and political action committees emerged There were many large anti nuclear protests and demonstrations More recently targeted campaigns have been conducted mainly by Greenpeace and Sortir du nuclaire has called for an official safety inspection of the Areva facilities

In 2000 the German government consisting of a coalition including the Green party Alliance 90The Greens officially announced its intention to phase out nuclear power in Germany Jrgen Trittin the Minister of Environment Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety reached an agreement with energy companies on the gradual shut down of the countrys nineteen nuclear power plants and a cessation of civil usage of nuclear power by 2020 Legislation was enacted in the Nuclear Exit Law The power plants in Stade and Obrigheim were turned off on November 14 2003 and May 11 2005 respectively Dismantling of the plants is scheduled to begin in 2007 But the Nuclear Exit Law did not ban enrichment stations  one in Gronau has received permission to extend operations There have been concerns over the safety of the phase out particularly in terms of the transport of nuclear waste In 2005 Angela Merkel won the German federal election in 2005 with the CDU party She has subsequently announced to re negotiate with energy companies the time limit for a shut down of nuclear power stations But as part of her pact with the SPD with whom the CDU form a coalition the phase out policy has for now been retained

In November 2008 a shipment of radioactive waste from German nuclear plants arrived at a storage site near Gorleben after being delayed by large protests from nuclear activists More than 15000 people took part in the protests which involved blocking trucks with sit down demonstrations and blocking the route with tractors The demonstrations were partly a response to conservative calls for a rethink of the planned phaseout of nuclear power stations

Japan has 55 reactors of total capacity 47577 MWe on line with 2 reactors under construction and 12 reactors planned Nuclear energy accounts for about 30 of Japans total electricity production from 475 GWe of capacity There are plans to increase this to 37 in 2009 and 41 in 2014 

On 16 July 2007 a severe earthquake hit the region where Tokyo Electrics Kashiwazaki Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant is located The plant with seven units is the largest single nuclear power station in the world All of the reactors were shut down and are expected to remain closed for damage verification and repairs for at least one year

During the Fukushima nuclear disaster there was a failure of cooling systems at Fukushima I Nuclear Power Station in Japan on March 11 2011 and a nuclear emergency was declared This was the first time a nuclear emergency had been declared in Japan and 140000 residents within 20km of the plant were moved out Explosions and a fire resulted in dangerous levels of radiation resulting in a stock market collapse and panic buying in supermarkets

Shippingport power plant was the first commercial nuclear power plant built in the United States in 1958 After the growth of nuclear power in the 1960s the Atomic Energy Commission anticipated that more than 1000 reactors would be operating in the United States by 2000 But by the end of the 1970s it became clear that nuclear power would not grow nearly so dramatically and more than 120 reactor orders were ultimately cancelled

As of 2007 in the United States there are 104 commercial nuclear generating units licensed to operate producing a total of 97400 megawatts which is approximately 20 of the nations total electric energy consumption The United States is the worlds largest supplier of commercial nuclear power

The Three Mile Island accident has been the most serious accident experienced by the US nuclear industry Other accidents include those at the Davis Besse Nuclear Power Plant which has been the source of two of the top five most dangerous nuclear incidents in the United States since 1979 according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission

Several US nuclear power plants closed well before their design lifetimes including Rancho Seco in 1989 in California San Onofre Unit 1 in 1992 in California Zion Nuclear Power Station in 1998 in Illinois and Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in 1992 in Oregon Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant in California closed in 1976 13 years after geologists discovered it was built on a fault Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant never operated commercially as an authorized Emergency Evacuation Plan could not be agreed on due to the political climate after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl accidents

Many plants have recently received 20 year extensions to their licensed lifetimes

By now the most serious nuclear accident has been the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 Other serious nuclear accidents include Fukushima I accident Three Mile Island accident the Windscale fire Mayak accident and the SL 1 accident In the period to 2007 63 major nuclear accidents have occurred at nuclear power plants Twenty nine of these have occurred since the Chernobyl disaster and 71 percent of all nuclear accidents occurred in the United States

On 11 March 2011 the Magnitude 90 devastating Sendai earthquake and tsunami took place in Japan As a result Nuclear Power Plant Fukushima I Fukushima II Nuclear Power Plant II Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant and Tkai Nuclear Power Plant stations consisting of eleven reactors were automatically shut down following the earthquake

At Fukushima I and II tsunami waves overtopped seawalls and destroyed diesel backup power systems leading to severe problems including two large explosions at Fukushima I and leakage of radiation Over 200000 people have been evacuated Seismic recordings at six assessed nuclear power plant facilities indicated the plants had been exposed to peak ground accelerations of 00370383g and peak ground velocities of 6185262 cmsec 

The Chernobyl disaster was a major accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant on April 26 1986 with an explosion at the plant and later radioactive contamination of the surrounding area It is so far the worst nuclear accident in the history of nuclear power A plume of radioactive fallout drifted over parts of the western Soviet Union Eastern and Western Europe Scandinavia the UK Ireland and eastern North America Large areas of Ukraine Belarus and Russia were badly damaged forcing the people in charge to have to evacuate and resettle more than 336000 people About 60 of the radioactive fallout landed in Belarus according to official post Soviet data 

The accident made many people worried about the safety of the Soviet nuclear power industry As a result plans for more nuclear plants were put on hold and the Soviet government who were not very open with its data had to make public more of its data The now independent countries of Russia Ukraine and Belarus have had to spend a lot of money and time on decontamination and health care costs of the Chernobyl accident Nobody knows how many people died because of this accident This is because the Soviets covered up information did not fully complete lists and did not let doctors list radiation as the reason why some people died Most of the expected long term deaths such as that from cancer have not yet happened and it is hard to say that Chernobyl was the full reason for their deaths

At Fukushima I and II tsunami waves overtopped seawalls and destroyed diesel backup power systems leading to severe problems including two large explosions at Fukushima I and leakage of radiation

On March 28 1979 the Unit 2 nuclear power plant on the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Dauphin County Pennsylvania near Harrisburg suffered a partial core meltdown

The Three Mile Island accident was the worst accident in American commercial nuclear power generating history even though it led to no deaths or injuries to plant workers or members of the nearby community 

The accident unfolded over the course of five tense days as a number of agencies at local state and federal level tried to diagnose the problem and decide whether or not the on going accident required a full emergency evacuation of the population The full details of the accident were not discovered until much later In the end the reactor was brought under control Although approximately 25000 people lived within five miles of the island at the time of the accident no identifiable injuries due to radiation occurred and a government report concluded that the projected number of excess fatal cancers due to the accident is approximately one But the accident had serious economic and public relations consequences and the cleanup process was slow and costly It also furthered a major decline in the public popularity of nuclear power exemplifying for many the worst fears about nuclear technology and until the Chernobyl disaster seven years later it was considered the worlds worst civilian nuclear accident

Davis Besse Nuclear Power Station is a nuclear power plant with a single reactor located on the southwest shore of Lake Erie near Oak Harbor Ohio According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Davis Besse has been the source of two of the top five most dangerous nuclear incidents in the United States since 1979

The SL 1 or Stationary Low Power Reactor Number One was a United States Army experimental nuclear power reactor which underwent a steam explosion and meltdown in January 1961 killing its three operators The direct cause was the improper withdrawal by a maintenance team of a single reactor control rod The event is the only reported fatal reactor accident in the United States 

On October 10 1957 the graphite core of a British nuclear reactor at Windscale Cumbria caught fire releasing substantial amounts of radioactive contamination into the surrounding area The event known as the Windscale fire was considered the worlds worst nuclear accident until the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 

The fire itself released an estimated 20000 curies of radioactive material into the nearby countryside Of particular concern was the radioactive isotope iodine 131 which has a half life of only 8 days but is taken up by the human body and stored in the thyroid As a result consumption of iodine 131 often leads to cancer of the thyroid

No one was evacuated from the surrounding area but there was concern that milk might be dangerously contaminated Milk from about 500km of nearby countryside was destroyed for about a month

Mayak is the name of a nuclear fuel reprocessing plants 150 km northwest of Chelyabinsk in Russia Working conditions at Mayak resulted in severe health hazards and many accidents with a serious accident occurring in 1957

The 1957 Kyshtym disaster occurred when the failure of the cooling system for a tank storing tens of thousands of tons of dissolved nuclear waste resulted in a non nuclear explosion having a force estimated at about 75 tons of TNT which released some 20 MCi of radiation Subsequently at least 200 people died of radiation sickness 10000 people were evacuated from their homes and 470000 people were exposed to radiation

Aung San Suu Kyi was elected in 1990 as the Prime Minister of Burma The Burmese military who have governed Burma since 1962 did not let her political party the National League for Democracy join the government Suu Kyi was arrested and forced her to stay in her house and not have any visitors

Since then she has used non violence methods to bring democracy to her country She is the leader of the National League for Democracy in Burma and a famous prisoner Suu Kyi won the Rafto Prize and the Sakharov Prize in 1990 and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 In 1992 she was awarded the Jawaharlal Nehru peace prize by India for her culture of personality 

After elections in Burma in 2010 she was released from house arrest in November 2010 Suu Kyi was not allowed to take part in the 2010 election as the government banned anyone who had been arrested 

She is sometimes called Daw Aung San Suu Kyi Daw is not part of her name but a title for older women This name shows respect for her

Aung San Suu Kyi was the third child in her family Her name Aung San comes from her father who is also named Aung San Kyi comes from her mother and Suu comes from her grandmother

Her father helped to make Burma independent from the United Kingdom in 1947 He was killed in the same year She grew up with her mother Khin Kyi and two brothers Aung San Lin and Aung San Oo in Yangon Her favourite brother Aung San Lin drowned in a pool accident when Suu Kyi was eight Her other brother lives in San Diego California and is an American citizen

The Nevada Test Site is an area set aside for the testing of nuclear weapons It is looked after by the United States Department of Energy It is in Nye County Nevada about 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas

Australia has no nuclear power stations and the Rudd Labor government was opposed to nuclear power for Australia However Australia does have a small research reactor in Sydney and it does export uranium 

Uranium mining and export and nuclear issues have often been the subject of public debate and the anti nuclear movement in Australia has a long history It began with the 197273 debate over French nuclear testing in the Pacific which involved several groups and the 197677 debate about uranium mining in Australia 

The case against nuclear power and uranium mining in Australia has been concerned with the impacts of nuclear energy with the shortcomings of nuclear power as an energy source and with presenting a sustainable energy strategy The most prominent adverse impact of nuclear power is seen to be its potential contribution towards proliferation of nuclear weapons For example the 1976 Ranger Inquiry report stated that The nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of nuclear war This is the most serious hazard associated with the industry 

The health risks associated with nuclear materials have also been of concern This has been the case worldwide because of incidents like the Chernobyl disaster but Australian concerns have also involved specific local factors such as controversy over the health effects of nuclear testing in Australia and the South Pacific and the emergence of prominent anti nuclear campaigner Helen Caldicott who is a medical practitioner 

The economics of nuclear power has been a factor in anti nuclear campaigns with critics arguing that such power is uneconomical in Australia particularly given the countrys abundance of coal resources

From the perspective of the anti nuclear movement most of the problems with nuclear power today are much the same as in the 1970s Nuclear reactor accidents remain a possibility and no convincing solution to the problem of long lived radioactive waste has been proposed Nuclear weapons proliferation continues to occur The alternatives to nuclear power energy efficiency and renewable energy have been further developed and commercialised

For many years the anti nuclear movement in the United States succeeded in delaying or halting commitments to build some new nuclear plants Anti nuclear campaigns that captured national public attention in the 1970s involved the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant Diablo Canyon Power Plant Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant and the Three Mile Island accident  More recent targeted campaigning has related to the Indian Point Energy Center Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station Salem Nuclear Power Plant Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant Idaho National Laboratory proposed Yucca Mountain waste repository the Hanford Site the Nevada Test Site Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and transportation of nuclear waste from the Los Alamos National Laboratory Many different groups have been involved in various protests and demonstrations over the years

More than fifty anti nuclear groups are operating or have operated in the United States These include Abalone Alliance Clamshell Alliance Greenpeace USA Institute for Energy and Environmental Research Musicians United for Safe Energy Nevada Desert Experience Nuclear Control Institute Nuclear Information and Resource Service Public Citizen Energy Program Shad Alliance and the Sierra Club 

Many well known scientists and engineers have expressed reservations about nuclear power These people include Barry Commoner S David Freeman John Gofman Amory Lovins Arjun Makhijani Gregory Minor and Joseph Romm

On January 25 2006 Palestinians voted for the Palestinian Legislative Council the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority Without counting the 2005 municipal elections and the January 9 2005 presidential election this was the first election to the PLC since 1996 since then elections had been delayed several times due to the continuing Israeli Palestinian conflict Palestinian voters in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank including East Jerusalem were allowed to participate in the election

Final results show that Hamas won the election with 74 seats The ruling party Fatah only got 45 giving Hamas the majority of the 132 available seats and the chance to form a majority government on their own Analysis of election results shows that the number of seats each party won agrees with their percentage of the vote for the 66 list seats Hamas is overrepresented in the 66 district seats because it nominated more strategically than Fatah and did not have to compete with third parties and independents for the same voters support

The Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei resigned but at the request of President Mahmoud Abbas remained as interim Prime Minister until February 19 when Hamas leader Ismail Haniya formed the new government The Quartet threatened to cut funds to the Palestinian Authority following the elections

Seahorses genus Hippocampus are a type of teleost fish They are called seahorses because their head looks like that of a horse There are about 3248 species of seahorse They live in tropical oceans 

Seahorses rely on camouflage to avoid detection

Seahorses are unique because the male hatches the eggs in a pouch on his belly The female inserts her ovipositor into the males brood pouch and deposits dozens to thousands of eggs As the female releases her eggs her body slims while his swells The male releases his sperm directly into the water sperm then fertilize the eggs in the pouch The fertilised eggs are then embedded in the pouch wall They get nutrition and oxygen from the fluid in the pouch In the pouch the salinity of the water is regulated this prepares the newborns for life in the sea

Both animals then sink back into the seagrass and she swims away The eggs then hatch 

Throughout gestation which in most species requires two to four weeks his mate visits him daily for morning greetings They interact for about 6 minutes The female then swims away until the next morning and the male vacuums up food through his snout

Research published in 2007 shoes that the males release sperm into the surrounding sea water during fertilization and not directly into the pouch as previously thought

The number of young released by the male seahorse averages 100 200 for most species but may be as low as 5 for the smaller species or as high as 1500 

When the fry are ready to be born the male expels them with muscular contractions He gives birth at night and is ready for the next batch of eggs by morning when his mate returns 

Like almost all other fish species seahorses do not nurture their young after birth Infants are susceptible to predators or ocean currents which wash them away from feeding grounds or into temperatures too extreme for their delicate bodies Fewer than 05 of infants survive to adulthood explaining why litters are so large These survival rates are actually fairly high compared to other fish because of their protected gestation This makes the process worth the cost to the father The eggs of most other fish are abandoned immediately after fertilization

Seahorses are the only fish that experience true male pregnancy

The Pacific Ring of Fire is an arc around the Pacific Ocean where many volcanoes and earthquakes are formed About three quarters of the worlds dormant and active volcanoes are here The ring is 40000km long and there are 452 volcanoes 

About 90 of the worlds earthquakes and 80 of the worlds largest earthquakes occur along the Ring of Fire The next most seismic region is the Alpide belt which extends from Java to Sumatra through the Himalayas the Mediterranean and out into the Atlantic The Mid Atlantic Ridge is the third most prominent earthquake belt 

The Ring of Fire is a direct result of plate tectonics and the movement and collisions of crustal plates

Old Faithful is a cone geyser in Wyoming in Yellowstone National Park in the United States Old Faithful was named in 1870 during the Washburn Langford Doane Expedition and was the first geyser in the park to get a name

Eruptions can shoot 3700 to 8400 US gallons of boiling water to a height of 106184 feet lasting from 15 to 5 minutes The average height of an eruption is 145 feet Eruptions often occur about 90 minutes away from each other but this difference in time can range from 45 to 125 minutes on occasion More than 137000 eruptions have been recorded Harry M Woodward first described a mathematical relationship between the duration and intervals of the eruptionsFactdateJuly 2007 Old Faithful is not the highest or biggest geyser in the park that title belongs to the less predictable Steamboat Geyser

Over the years the length of the difference of time has increased which may be the result of earthquakes changing underground water levels These disruptions have made the earlier mathematical relationship inaccurate but have in fact made Old Faithful more predictable With an error of 10 minutes Old Faithful will erupt 65 minutes after an eruption lasting less than 25 minutes or 92 minutes after an eruption lasting more than 25 minutes The reliability of Old Faithful can be attributed to the fact that it is not connected to any other thermal features of the Upper Geyser Basin

Between 1983 and 1994 four probes containing temperature and pressure measurement devices and video equipment were lowered into Old Faithful The probes were lowered as deep as 72 feet Temperature measurements of the water at this depth was 244 F the same as was measured in 1942 The video probes were lowered to a maximum depth of 42 feet to observe the conduit formation and the processes that took place in the conduit Some of the processes observed include fog formation from the interaction of cool air from above mixing with heated air from below the recharge processes of water entering into the conduit and expanding from below and entry of superheated steam measuring as high as 265 F into the conduit

Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata is an Argentina sports club of the city of La Plata Buenos Aires It was founded on June 3 1887 as Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima Its principal activity is football and it competes in the First Divisin Argentina Argentinas premier league 

Its stadium is the Juan Carlos Zerillo known as the Estadio del Bosque capacity for 33000 spectators

Gimnasia were champions of Divisin Intermedia of the Argentine Football in 1915 of the First Divisin in 1929 of the Copa Centenario de la AFA in 1994 and of the Second division in 1944 1947 and 1952 it was runner up of the First Divisin in 1924 Clausura 1995 Clausura 1996 Apertura 1998 Clausura 2002 and Apertura 2005

The Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata was founded on June 3 1887 as a civil association and thus is the oldest surviving football club in the whole of South America Its foundation came barely five years after the creation of the City of La Plata in 1882 The first sports offered to its members were as its Spanish name indicates gymnastics and fencing Clubs supporting these sports were common among the upper classes at the end of the 19th century Later on other disciplines were added including track and field football basketball and rugby

The institution changed name a few times from April to December 1897 it was called a Club de Esgrima due to the fact that fencing was the only activity practised at that moment On December 17 1897 it returned to its original name Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima From July 1952 to September 30 1955 the club was named Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima de Eva Pern due to the fact that the city of La Plata itself had been renamed Eva Pern in 1952 after Eva Perns death The city returned to its previous name during the government of the Liberating Revolution and so did the club However it remained unduly identified legally as Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata a mistake that was corrected on August 7 1964 after the new statute was approved

Gimnasia had to abandon its original field at the corner of 13th and 71st streets in 1905 at that time it chose to discontinue the practice of football and to devote the club mainly to social activities As a result some members who were interested in playing football left and founded a club devoted principally to that activity Estudiantes de La Plata Later in 1912 a group of football players who were in conflict with Estudiantes de La Plata joined Club Independencia which later merged with Gimnasia y Esgrima in 1914 thereby returning to the practice of football In 1915 Gimnasia y Esgrima joins Divisin Intermedia wins the championship and thus promotion to the Primera Divisin Argentina On that year Gimnasia obtains the two cups that were in dispute Competencia Adolfo J Bullrich Cup and Campeonato Intermedia Cup

On April 27 1916 Gimnasia played against Estudiantes de La Plata its classic rival for the first time The match took place at the Estudiantes de La Plata field where Gimnasia y Esgrima defeated its classic rival 10 That year Gimnasia finished the championship in fourth place behind Racing Club Club Atltico Platense and River Plate with nine victories nine ties and three defeats In 1921 Gimnasia would again reach fourth place behind Racing Club River Plate and Independiente as a result of 23 victories six ties and nine defeats

On April 27 1924 the new stadium was inaugurated located in La Platas main park at the intersection of 60th avenue and 118th street it was named Stadium Juan Carlos Zerillo Gimnasia y Esgrima remained undefeated in its new stadium for 15 months On that year Gimnasia achieved second place behind San Lorenzo with 15 victories seven ties and one defeat

In 1929 Gimnasia y Esgrima obtains its only First Division title in the amateur era after a campaign that included fourteen victories and three defeats The championship of 1929 was organized along the Copa Estmulo format that is teams where separated in two zones the title being defined in a game between the winners of each zone Gimnasia y Esgrima won the first place in the odd zone which included River Plate Racing Club Huracn and Estudiantes de La Plata among other teams The even zone was won by Boca Juniors that qualified thus for the final meeting

The final took place on February 9 1930 at the old stadium of River Plate On that day Gimnasia fielded Felipe Scarpone Di Giano and Evaristo Delovo Rusciti Santilln and Belli Curell Varallo Maleani Daz and Morgada After being down 01 at half time the team turned the result and won 2 1 with two goals by Martin Maleani That same year Gimnasia won the Reserve championship Consequently Gimnasia y Esgrima became the first club of La Plata to earn a title in a competition organized by an Association recognized by FIFA

Between December 1930 and April 1931 Gimnasias team which later would be known as El Expreso toured Europe and Brazil Gimnasia became the first Argentine club outside Greater Buenos Aires to compete in Europe and the first ever to play in Portugal Czechoslovakia Austria and Italy In the European portion of the tour Gimnasia played twenty two games winning eleven and losing six On February 15 1931 Gimnasia defeated Sportverein Mnchen 4 0 at Munich in a game remarkable for being the first match played by an Argentine team on a snow covered pitch On March 8 Gimnasia won 3 1 over AC Sparta Praha at Prague a team that was arguably the strongest in Europe at the time and that no South American team had yet defeated Gimnasia also won its matches against three of the most important European clubs a 3 1 victory against Real Madrid 2 1 against FC Barcelona and 1 0 against Benfica

Already in the professional era Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata entered in the history of Argentine soccer with a famous team known as El Expreso The 1933 Express comfortably won the first round of the First Division championship In the second round Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata led the championship until it faced Boca Juniors and San Lorenzo de Almagro In these matches Gimnasia was subject to openly biased arbitration In the latter game the referee Rojo Mir favoured so blatantly San Lorenzo that the Gimnasia players famously refused to continue with the charade and went on strike They simply sat on the field while San Lorenzo scored unopposedly before the referee terminated the game with a 71 outcome The 1933 team ended in the fourth place with a record of 21 victories four draws and nine defeats However the legendary Express had been born and it never left the memory of its fans The top scorer of The Express was Arturo El Torito Nan with 33 goals

This Cup was disputed in 1960 and was organized by the club Estudiantes de La Plata It was called Gobernador de la Province of Buenos Aires Dr Oscar Alende Cup in honoring the governor Oscar Alende The cup was an international quadrangular comprising friendly matches between Estudiantes Gimnasia Club Nacional de Football and Club Atltico Pearol the latter being the two main football clubs from Uruguay

Gimnasia won both meetings against the Uruguayan teams 52 against Nacional and 10 against Pearol Estudiantes lost its respective games for 01 and 25

In the last match Gimnasia tied with Estudiantes 22 On February 13 1960 Gimnasia was therefore crowned champion of the Gobernador Alende Cup at the stadium of its classic archrival located at the intersection of the 57 1 streets of La Plata

One of the teams most remembered by Gimnasia fans is La Barredora After almost a decade alternating good and bad performances the championships organized by the Asociacin del Ftbol Argentino were restructured

The result was the creation of two championships the Metropolitano played by teams affiliated directly to the AFA and the Nacional played by the teams placed in the top positions of the Metropolitano in addition to teams from the leagues of the Argentine interior The rest of the teams played the Promocional and Reclasificatorio cups Other variants existed whereby the Metropolitano was played as an all team home and away round robin and the Nacional in a two zone competition

In the first year 1967 Gimnasia y Esgrima was champion of the Promocional tournament

In 1970 Gimnasia y Esgrima finished second the zone B behind Chacarita Juniors and qualified to the Nacional semifinal against Rosario Central who had occupied the first position in the zone A At that time a conflict developped between the players and the clubs administration on a disagreement about performance remuneration Unable to solve the issue the President Oscar Venturino fielded the clubs third division on the semifinal at Rosario The final result was a 30 victory for Rosario Central

The typical eleven in that remarkable team were Hugo Orlando Gatti Ricardo Rezza Jos Bernab Leonardi Jos Masnik Roberto Zywica Roberto Gonzalo Hctor Pignani Jos Santiago Delio Onnis Jos Nstor Meija Jorge Castiglia Jos Varacka was the coach

After a bad campaign Gimnasia y Esgrima is relegated to Primera B in 1979 The team played in the Second Division between 1980 and 1984 year in which it returns to First Division The team included football players such as Ricardo El Pulpo Kuzemka and Carlos Carri its coach was Nito Veiga

In 1984 Gimnasia y Esgrima obtained the third place in the overall table and thus qualified to dispute an Octogonal for the second promotion to First Division The other teams in the octogonal were Racing Club Argentino de Rosario Club Atltico Tigre Defensores de Belgrano Club Atltico Lans Nueva Chicago and Deportivo Morn Gimnasia reached the final where it defeated Racing Club twice first 3 1 in Avellaneda and then 4 2 in La Plata on December 30 1984 After these victories Gimnasia returned to First Division in 1985 and has been playing there ever since

The AFA organized in 1993 a cup style tournament named Copa Centenario to celebrate its hundredth anniversary Each first division team played its derby rival in two rounds in a double elimination system Gimnasia eliminated its classic rival Estudiantes 10 with a goal by Guillermo Barros Schelotto and qualified for the next round after a 00 tie in the return match Then Gimnasia successively eliminated Newells Old Boys Argentinos Juniors and Belgrano de Crdoba to win the round of winners River Plate won the round of losers and qualified for the final with Gimnasia having home court advantage

Gimnasia won the final 31 with goals by Hugo Romeo Guerra Fernndez and Guillermo Barros Schelotto Rivers goal was scored by Villalba Gimnasias winning team included Lavalln Sanguinetti Morant Ortiz Dopazo Fernndez Bianco Talarico Gustavo Barros Schelotto Guillermo Barros Schelotto and Guerra

After winning this cup Gimnasia was invited to participate on the Sanwa Bank Cup in 1994

With veteran coach Carlos Timoteo Griguol at the helm Gimnasia took second place in the 1995 Clausura tournament repeating the performance in 1996 and 1998 Also took second place in 2002

Gimnasia also obtained second place in 2005 under Pedro Troglios management after an excellent campaign that had them fighting neck to neck with Boca Juniors until the very end of the championship

These strong showings allowed Gimnasia to take part in the top club level competitions in South America the Copa Sudamericana during the 2006 and 2007 editions of the Copa Libertadores

On September 10 2006 during the halftime of a match against Boca Juniors club president Juan Jos Muoz confronted referee Daniel Gimnez who called off the match immediately with Gimnasia leading 10 Muoz was reprimanded by the football association and temporarily removed from its executive committee although he was confirmed as Gimnasias President by the clubs board A few days later Gimnasia was eliminated from the Copa Sudamericana by the Chilean champions Colo Colo following a quarter final match where a player of Gimnasia was injured by a cement piece thrown by Chilean supporters Due to Gimnasias physical play in the second leg of the quarter finals in Argentina Argentine Football Associations president Julio Grondona wrote a personal letter to the president of the ANFP apologizing for the roughness of the Gimnasia players

The pending second half against Boca Juniors was played on November 8 2006 Boca Juniors scored four goals and won the match After the match Troglio and some of the players hinted that the team had received death threats from some supporters who wanted to benefit Boca in its championship bid against Gimnasias archrivals Estudiantes Nevertheless Estudiantes obtained the title in the end 

La Plata District Attorney Marcelo Romero opened an investigation and cited some players and club officers to testify but the entire affair was soon dismissed Player Marcelo Goux refused to participate in the next match and quit the team soon afterwards as did fellow players Martn Cardetti and Ariel Franco Many articles condemned Muozs handling of the situation accusing him of lying to the press and of treating violent fans as his protgs

After a string of losses in the local championship and the Copa Libertadores there were renewed calls for Muoz to resign Coach Troglio felt the burden of responsibility and quit his post on April 2 2007 Gimnasia hired first famed Colombian trainer Francisco Maturana and then Julio Csar Falcioni both with limited success

In the December 2007 election Muoz did not run and the candidate he supported lost to the opposition New club president Walter Gisande hired former player Guillermo Sanguinetti as team coach and tried to convince former players notably Diego Alonso and Guillermo Barros Schelotto to return to Gimnasia Only Alonso who was playing in China made the leap

Sanguinetti quit after a string of bad results that left Gimnasia in serious danger of relegation Under new coach Leonardo Madeln team results improved markedly and as of the beginning of the 2009 Clausura tournament Gimnasia is better positioned to stay in the Primera level

The new management also campaigned for a return to its traditional ground at El Bosque Starting April 2008 the stadium underwent a structural engineering evaluation after all security measures requested by authorities were put in place On June 2008 Gimnasia was allowed to play again at El Bosque the return took place in a match against Lans the last game of the Clausura 2008 championship Mayor Pablo Bruera has indicated that the city will let Gimnasia buy or lease some city owned lands for erecting a sports complex

The shield of the Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata is a wreath in which top part is outlined a helmet with a heraldic crest At the center on enamel and with the colors of the club the club monogram appears in relief In the top cantons like a guard there appear the hilts of a saber and a foil with their sharp points emerging at lower part of the shield To the sides of the center a rama of laurels spreads the helmet for every side

Since its inception the club shield has undergone some modifications From 1887 until 1928 the shield used was devised by Emilio Coutauret and it was characterized by a handcrafted and adorned design In 1964 following a reform of the foundational statute Gimnasias shield adopted a simpler form while still keeping the essence of the original one This is the logo in current use and often displayed on the teams jerseys

There have been some minor changes introduced in the past few years During Hctor Domnguezs presidency the abbreviation at the center of the shield was changed replacing the historical CGE for the GELP modification that persisted during the mandates of Gliemmo and Muoz Since the beginning of Walter Gisandes presidency it was decided to return to the original abbreviation of CGE

The official historical uniform of Gimnasia y Esgrima is based on the colours displayed in the club shield as established in the institutional statute

In the first years of life of the institution the colors adopted were the white and light blue seeking of this form to highlight the fact that it was an Argentine club The first vest used by the team had vertical white and light blue stripes

Later in 1905 it was decided to change the colors to make it distinct from Racing Club This resulted in a vest with vertical stripes of white and navy blue color

Finally from 1910 the design was modified changing the vertical stripes into the horizontal band of navy blue color over a white jersey which has been used ever since

The following table details chronologically the providing companies of apparel and the sponsors that it has had Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata from the years 1980 and 1990 respectively

During the year 2009 the apparel of Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata will be provided by the company Kappa the one who will provide from uniform sports up to the extra sports clothes In turn jersey will be supported by the company La Nueva Seguros of which it will take the name written in the principal band

Within the city of La Plata and its environs the Gimnasia fan base used to be identified with the working class contrasting with the mostly middle class Estudiantes constituency This characterization is no longer true Most of Gimnasia y Esgrima fans are from the Greater La Plata area

The fans collective name for itself is La 22 after 22nd street in La Plata where many famous fans lived notably Marcelo Amuchstegui Known as Loco Fierro Amuchstegui was famous for his exploits such as hanging a 100 meter Gimnasia flag in the Bombonera stadium He was shot to death by Rosario police in a murky episode on May 28 1991 allegedly during an armed robbery

As it is the case with some other clubs in the Argentine First Division the fans celebrate with a large party and outside gathering the Worldwide Day of Gimnasias Fans on each December 10

Since the 1960s Gimnasia has been known as El Lobo after the story of Red Riding Hood since its historical football field is located in the middle of La Platas main park known as El Bosque Many other Argentine clubs also called Gimnasia y Esgrima adopted later the nicknames of El Lobo after the La Plata team

Another nickname mensanas derives from the Latin motto used in the shield Mens sana in corpore sano

An original nickname was triperos This name has its origin in the fact that many of Gimnasias original supporters worked in the meat processing plants of nearby Berisso In newspaper caricatures from the early 1900s Gimnasia was accordingly depicted as a butcher instead of the current wolf Yet still today Gimnasia is often greeted into the stadia by its fans with a resounding Tripa corazn Curiously the same nickname is applied when referring to the population of Porto in Portugal although the meaning of the nickname in Portuguese is closer to tripe eaters 

Another nickname is basureros acquired during the presidency of Mr Venturino in the 1970s who also managed the private company dealing with trash pickup in La Plata

The Stadium Juan Carlos Zerillo known as El Bosque has a capacity of 31460 and was used continuously until 2005

When a new city stadium was built for La Plata both Gimnasia and Estudiantes initially chose to stay at their respective fields but this arrangement collapsed when both fields were closed down due to new security regulations In the 2006 Clausura tournament Gimnasia began to use the city stadium for home games

Beginning on March 2008 Gimnasia made various reforms to its old stadium seeking to secure the permit for its use at selected games Finally on June 2008 the El Bosque grounds were reapproved for First Division competitions On Saturday June 21 2008 on the occasion of the last game of the Clausura 2008 championship Gimnasia returned to its old home in a match against Lans

GELP has a female volleyball team They are the only one of the nine founder clubs from the Federacin de Voleibol y Pelota al Cesto  still playing volleyball and in the highest division The federation is now Federacin Metropolitana de Voleibol

Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata is also known for several excellent campaigns in basketball The GELP basketball team peaked during the 1978 and 1979 campaigns when they won twice in a row Argentinas premier basketball championship In both cases they prevailed over favorite Obras Sanitarias Argentinas powerhouse at the time The team included players such as Gallego Gonzlez Finito Gehrmann Peinado as well as some Americans Michael Jackson Lawrence Jackson Jr and the team leader and star point guard Clarence Edgar Metcalfe chosen as the league MVP in 1979 The twice champions were coached by Rolando Sfeir

Gimnasia were runners up in the 200304 Argentine league tournament when GELP was defeated by Boca Juniors 42 in the final series In the following season the team was relegated to the TNA after president Juan Jos Muoz decreased substantially the basketball budget thereby causing the loss of its principal players Nowadays Gimnasias first team of basketball plays in the TNA

In addition to the aforementioned sport activities Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata participated in other disciplines throughout its history The following sports are no longer practiced in the club

Other activities were available at the club at various periods namely water polo boxing cycling petanque auto racing judo and tennis among others

I have a question for other users on this site I would like to start having people post a tally in the RfA whenever they have an RfA so that it is easier on the bureaucrats to close out Requests for adminships Although I doubt that we have enough people to substantiate a practical use for it after going through most of the old logs tallies usually end up getting placed onto already closed out Requests for adminship If we are already putting tallies onto Requests for adminship after they get archived why not have a tally right when someone posts up an RfA so that someone wouldnt have to after the closing of the request Opinions and thoughts on this are welcome Cheers Razorflame 0257 10 May 2008

Thanks in advance Nssesl

And it is only about one month from your previous nomination so may be it is too soon for a change to take place So for now Im not sure if we should give you access to admin tools  Huji Thats not a reason just a conspiracy

Huji has stated some very valid reasons  Eptalon Ditto to above

The exchanges we have had on our user talks make it seem like this is your own personal wiki  Microchip08 He openly said he did not feel that way

you just had an RfA a couple of weeks ago which shows that you think this is a game and getting adminship is what you crave for I will never support any of your RfAs in the future if this continues  Cometstyles He believes he could do a good job and that he has now cleaned up his act

Making 500 minor edits a day isnt really helping anyone  Isis Have you ever made 500 edits in a day

These are just some of the reasons given when denying Razorflame his 6th RfA Even though he has the second most edits of any user I am now very depressed that some users will keep denying him without good reason except you just had an RfA a couple of weeks ago and making 500 minor edits a day isnt really helping anyone I am not trying to cause trouble with this only to show that myself a month old user who hasnt had problems with Razorflame thinks of the coldness that he has been shown Regardless of all the work that he has done in trying to become a better editor while he has been on Simple Now he is not wanting to ever try again Coincidence  AmericanEagle 0041 16 May 2008

AmericanEagle I appreciate your efforts here I understand that your view is some people have declined to give admin tools to Razorflame and I understand that you think it is unfair However I believe the situation has made you a little impatient and you might have missed the point some of us made I didnt vote in oppose of Razorflames adminship because of his nominating himself for the sixth time I did so because the last times he nominated himself people made valid points things he didnt do right and I expected him to nominate himself for the next time when he has really learned those points You see it is fine in my view for a person to nominate himself for 6th time I dont repeat my vote every time I really reconsider the RfA as if it was the 2nd nomination All previous nominations build up part of the information based on which I vote Even if the person hasnt had previous nominations but has been warned on his talk page or elsewhere about making mistakes I still act the same I consider whether the user has took his lessons from what he has been told about or not

It is true that adminship can act as a higher level of permissions However I believe that being a sysop only gives you some new tools These tools are not given to every user because people may mess up with them if they dont have the experience and understanding in the first place This is particularly important with big wikis like Wikipedias If a user still messes up with the commonly available tools it is not time for him to be given other more sensitive tools I think Razorflame is a good user but still makes some mistakes which can be avoided if he pays a little more attention to what he does and to what others do As long as I feel he makes more mistakes than an average experienced user I prefer these mistakes to take place with regards to the common tools not the more sensitive tools

Unlike Nanochip08 and The life of Brian the fact that Razorflames RfA was a self nomination had the least effect on my decision If he is nominated for the seventh time and I find him really ready for the job Ill surely vote in his support Until then I wish him to continue as a good editor here and to build up more experience

Sorry for the long talk  Huji reply 1329 16 May 2008

I wrote that headline the way I did on purpose It has 2 different meanings

The meaning that I was hoping people would get would be the second one but it seems to me that you all got the first one pretty easily I am still looking forward to being an administrator the only diffrerence is that I will now wait for someone to nominate me for it Cheers Razorflame 2002 16 May 2008

Public speaking is speaking to a group of people in an organized way to give information influence or persuade or to entertain the listeners 

In public speaking there are five important questions which are often expressed as who is saying what to whom using which medium with what effects 

The purpose of public speaking can range from simply giving information to getting to act to simply telling a story 

Good speakers are often able to change the way the listeners feel and not just give them information Public speaking can be a powerful tool to use for goals such as motivation influence persuasion informing translation or simply entertaining

The Ancient Greeks called public speaking rhetoric the Romans called it oratory it is also known as forensic speaking or forensics Propaganda is another name for speech in favour or against some point of view

Asteroids are assigned a type based on spectral shape color and sometimes albedo These types are thought to correspond to an asteroids surface composition For small bodies which are not internally differentiated the surface and internal compositions are presumably similar while large bodies such as 1 Ceres and 4 Vesta are known to have internal structure

A list of types can be found at asteroid spectral classes

The present day classification was initiated by Clark R Chapman David Morrison and Ben Zellner in 1975 Chapman19751 with three categories C for dark carbonaceous objects S for stony objects and U for those which did not fit into either C or S This classification has since been expanded and clarified

A number of classification schemes are currently in existence PDS2BusAsteroidsIII3 and while they strive to retain some mutual consistency quite a few asteroids are sorted into different classes depending on the particular scheme This is due to the use of different criteria for each approach The two most widely used classifications are described below

The most widely used taxonomy for over a decade has been that of David J Tholen first proposed in 1984 This classification was developed from broad band spectra obtained during the Eight Color Asteroid Survey in the 1980s in combination with albedo measurements Tholen19894 The original formulation was based on 978 asteroids

This scheme includes 14 types with the majority of asteroids falling into one of three broad categories and several smaller types They are with their largest exemplars

and the small classes

Objects were sometimes assigned a combined type such as eg CG when their properties were a combination of those typical for several types

This is a more recent taxonomy introduced by Schelte J Bus and Richard P Binzel in 2002 based on the Small Main Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey of 1447 asteroids Bus20025 This survey produced spectra of a far higher resolution than ECAS and was able to resolve a variety of narrow spectral features However a somewhat smaller range of wavelengths was observed Also albedos were not considered While attempting to keep to the Tholen taxonomy as much as possible given the differing data asteroids were sorted into the 24 types given below The majority of bodies fall again into the three broad C S and X categories with a few unusual bodies categorized into several smaller types

A significant number of small asteroids were found to fall in the Q R and V types which were represented by only a single body in the Tholen scheme In this Bus and Binzel SMASS scheme only a single type was assigned to any particular asteroid

A few Near Earth objects have spectra which differ strongly from any of the SMASS classes This is presumably because these bodies are much smaller than those detected in the Main Belt and as such may have younger less altered surfaces or be composed of a less varied mix of minerals

These classification schemes are expected to be refined andor replaced as further research progresses However for now the spectral classification based on the two above coarse resolution spectroscopic surveys from the 1990s is still the standard Scientists have been unable to agree on a better taxonomic system largely due to the difficulty of obtaining detailed measurements consistently for a large sample of asteroids

The three main groupings of asteroids are thought to be related to the three basic meteorite types

The Gallic group is a dynamical grouping of the prograde irregular satellites of Saturn following similar orbits Their semi major axes range between 16 and 19 Gm their inclinations between 35 and 40 and their eccentricities around 053

The International Astronomical Union reserves names taken from Gallic mythology for these moons

Similar mean orbital elements led the discoverers to postulate a common origin for the group in a break up of a larger body

The diagram illustrates the Gallic group in relation to other irregular satellites of Saturn The eccentricity of the orbits is represented by the yellow segments with the inclination represented on Y axis

The four members of the group are

The group was later found to be physically homogenous all satellites displaying light red colour and similar infrared indices  

Remarkably recent observations revealed that the largest member of the group Albiorix displays actually two different colours one compatible with Eriapo and Tarvos and another less red Instead of the common progenitor it was postulated that Tarvos and Erriapus could be fragments of Albiorix leaving a large less red crater Such an impact would require a body with the diameter in excess of 1 km and relative velocity close to 5 kms resulting in a large crater with the radius of 12 km Numerous very large craters observed on Phoebe prove the existence of such collisions in the Saturnian systems past

Sulawesi is one of the four larger Sunda Islands of Indonesia and is situated between Borneo and the Maluku Islands

Sulawesi is the worlds eleventh largest island covering an area of 174600 km2 The island is surrounded by Borneo to the west by the Philippines to the north by Maluku to the east and by Flores and Timor to the south It has a distinctive shape dominated by four large peninsulas the Semenanjung Minahassa the East Peninsula the South Peninsula and the South east Peninsula The central part of the island is ruggedly mountainous such that the islands peninsulas have traditionally been remote from each other with better connections by sea than by road

Flores is one of the Lesser Sunda Islands an island arc with an estimated area of 14300 km extending east from the Java island of Indonesia The population is estimated to be around 15 million and the largest town is Maumere

Flores is located east of Sumbawa and Komodo and west of Lembata and the Alor Archipelago To the southeast is Timor To the south across the Sumba strait is Sumba and to the north beyond the Flores Sea is Sulawesi

On December 12 1992 an earthquake measuring 70 on the Richter scale occurred killing 2000 people in the town of Maumere

Sumbawa is an Indonesian island in the middle of the Lesser Sunda Islands chain It has Lombok to the west Flores to the east and Sumba farther to the southeast It is in the province of West Nusa Tenggara 

Sumbawa is 15448 km About 15 million people live there It marks the boundary between the islands to the west which were influenced by religion and culture spreading from India and the region to the east that was not so influenced

Sumbawa is inside the Pacific Ring of Fire It is a volcanic island including Mount Tambora which exploded in 1815 the most destructive volcanic eruption in modern history The eruption killed as many as 92000 It also apparently destroyed a small culture of Southeast Asian affinity known to archaeologists as the Tamboran kingdom It launched 100 cubic kilometers of ash into the upper atmosphere which caused 1816 to be the year without a summer 

 Clothing in Ancient Rome is most commonly known by the toga and stola The cloth was made from wool linen or hemp Cotton and silk were also used more rarely Leather was also used

The Toga was an important part of dress worn only by Roman citizens and after the second century BC only by men After that the only females to wear togas were prostitutes and government officials The colours of togas had meaning A toga could be edged with purple or the body of the cloth could be saffron Only emperors could wear entirely purple togas In other words clothing reflected status as well as practical needs A red lined Toga often shown shame and disgrace often worn when banished or before an exocution

A mantle or headcloth worn by women with the stola It drapes over the shoulders and round the body

The Stola is a floor length dress with long sleeves It is worn over a tunic The Stola was a symbol of marriage in ancient Rome times Girls wore a simple tunic except when going to an evening event when ankle length tunics were worn

Slaves wore simple woolen tunics Tunics of cotton could by worn by any class as under garments

A cloak or cape fastened at one shoulder worn by military commanders The paludamentum was generally crimson scarlet or purple in colour

Theory of Colours is a book by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe published in 1810 It contains some of the earliest and most accurate descriptions of phenomena such as coloured shadows refraction and chromatic aberration 

Its influence extends primarily to the art world especially among the Pre Raphaelites Turner studied it comprehensively and referred to it in the titles of several paintings Wassily Kandinsky considered Goethes theory one of the most important works 

Although Goethes work was never well received by physicists a number of philosophers and physicists have been known to have concerned themselves with it including Arthur Schopenhauer Kurt Gdel Werner Heisenberg Ludwig Wittgenstein and Hermann von Helmholtz Mitchell Feigenbaum even convinced himself that Goethe had been right about colour 

In his book Goethe shows how colour is perceived in a variety of circumstances and considers Isaac Newtons observations to be special cases Goethes concern was not so much with the measurement of colour phenomenon but with how qualities of colour are perceived Science has come to understand the distinction between the optical spectrum as observed by Newton and the phenomenon of human colour perception as presented by Goethe

For Goethe the highest is to understand that all fact is really theory The blue of the sky reveals to us the basic law of color Search nothing beyond the phenomena they themselves are the theory

Goethes studies of colour began with subjective experiments which examined the effects of turbid media on the perception of light and dark He observed that lights seen through a turbid medium would appear yellowish and darkness seen through a turbid medium that had been lightened would appear blue 

Starting from these observations he began numerous experiments observing the effects of darkening and lightening on the perception of colour in many different circumstances

For Goethe light is the simplest most undivided most homogenous being that we know Confronting it is the darkness Unlike his contemporaries Goethe did not see darkness as an absence of light but rather as polar to and interacting with light 

Based on his experiments with turbid media Goethe characterized colour as arising from the dynamic interplay of darkness and light The editor of the Kurschner edition of Goethes works gives the following analogy 

Goethe writes 

When viewed through a prism the orientation of a light dark boundary with respect to the prism is significant With white above a dark boundary we observe the light extending a blue violet edge into the dark area whereas dark above a light boundary results in a red yellow edge extending into the light area 

Goethe was intrigued by this difference He felt that this arising of colour at light dark boundaries was fundamental to the creation of the spectrum

Since the colour phenomenon relies on the adjacency of light and dark there are two ways to produce a spectrum with a light beam in a dark room and with a dark beam in a light room

Goethe recorded the sequence of colours projected at various distances from a prism for both cases In both cases he found that the yellow and blue edges remain closest to the side which is light and red and violet edges remain closest to the side which is dark At a certain distance these edges overlap When these edges overlap in a light spectrum green results when they overlap in a dark spectrum magenta results

With a light spectrum coming out of the prism one sees a shaft of light surrounded by dark We find yellow red colours along the top edge and blue violet colours along the bottom edge The spectrum with green in the middle arises only where the blue violet edges overlap the yellow red edges

With a dark spectrum we find violet blue along the top edge and red yellow along the bottom edge where these edges overlap we find magenta

Due to their different approaches to a common subject many misunderstandings have arisen between Newtons mathematical understanding of optics and Goethes experiential approach 

Because Newton understands white light to be composed of individual colours and Goethe sees colour arising from the interaction of light and dark they come to different conclusions on the question is the optical spectrum a primary or a compound phenomenon 

For Newton all the colours already exist in white light and the prism merely fans them out according to their refrangability Goethe sought to show that as a turbid medium the prism was an integral factor in the arising of colour 

Whereas Newton narrowed the beam of light in order to isolate the phenomenon Goethe observed that with a wider aperture there was no spectrum He saw only reddish yellow edges and blue cyan edges with white between them and the spectrum arose only where these edges came close enough to overlap For him the spectrum could be explained by the simpler phenomena of colour arising from the interaction of light and dark edges Goethes reification of darkness has caused almost all of modern physics to reject Goethes theory 

Newton explains the fact that all the colors appear only when the prism is at a certain distance from the screen whereas the middle otherwise is white by saying the more strongly diverted lights from the upper part of the image and the more weakly diverted ones from the lower part fall together in the middle and mix into white The colors appear only at the edges because there none of the more strongly diverted parts of the light from above can fall into the most weakly diverted parts of the light and none of the more weakly diverted ones from below can fall into the most strongly diverted ones

In organic chemistry an alkene olefin or olefine is an unsaturated chemical compound containing at least one carbon to carbon double bond The simplest alkenes with only one double bond no rings and no other functional groups are hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n

Aromatic compounds are often drawn as cyclic alkenes but their structure and properties are different and they are not considered to be alkenes

The double bond in the middle makes them more reactive because the molecule is not saturated An alkenes unsaturation means that it will take the color out of bromine The names of alkenes always end with ene

The following is a list of the first sixteen Alkenes

The physical properties of alkenes are comparable with those of alkanes The main differences between the two are that the acidity levels of alkenes are much higher than the ones in alkanes The physical state depends on molecular mass The simplest alkenes ethene propene and butene are gases Linear alkenes of approximately five to sixteen carbons are liquids and higher alkenes are waxy solids

Libration is a French daily newspaper founded in Paris in 1973 by Jean Paul Sartre

Justice is a concept on ethics and law that means that people behave in a way that is fair equal and balanced for everyone 

Governments and especially the police and courts see that the laws are obeyed in most societies Because they can punish a person for not obeying the law most people agree that laws should be fair and the same for everyone But governments sometimes make laws that many people believe are not just If many people believe this people may lose respect for the law and may even disobey it However in democratic societies the law itself has ways to change or get rid of these unjust laws

The 2008 Sichuan earthquake was a big earthquake in China on May 12 2008 Thousands of people were killed thousands more people were missing and thousands were hurt Millions of people were left homeless after their houses fell down The earthquake could be felt thousands of kilometres away

The earthquake was measured at 80Ms and 83 Mw by the China Seismological Bureau 

The earthquake happened at 228pm CST The earthquakes epicenter was convert80kmmi0 west northwest of Chengdu the capital of Sichuan province It was under the ground at a depth of convert19kmmi0 The earthquake was felt in Beijing convert1500kmmi0 away and in Shanghai convert1700kmmi0 away Tall office buildings in those cities shook with the tremor The earthquake was also felt in nearby countries

It is believed that 69227 people died 374176 people were hurt and 18222 people listed as missing The earthquake left about 48 million people homeless though the number could be as high as 11 million Approximately 15 million people lived in the affected area It was the deadliest and strongest earthquake to hit China since the 1976 Tangshan earthquake which killed at least 240000 people

52 big aftershocks ranging in size from 44 to 60 were recorded within 72 hours of the main tremor 

Scientists worked out that the earth moved up to convert9mft0lkonabbron along the Longmen Shan Fault This fault is about convert240kmmi0lkonabbron long and convert20kmmi0lkonabbron deep The earthquake made the ground on the surface move more than convert3mft0lkonabbron Japanese seismologist Yuji Yagi said that the earthquake took place in two parts The fault tore in two sections the first one moving about convert7ydm0lkonabbron In the second part of the quake the fault moved another convert4ydm0lkonabbron 

The earthquake lasted about two minutes It was powerful because it did not happen very deep under the ground Many people were killed because there were so many people living above the epicenter Teruyuki Kato a seismologist at the University of Tokyo said that the shock waves traveled a long way The waves did not lose their power because of the hardness of the ground in central China

A list of places that felt the earthquake

The quake happened because a part of the earths surface called the India plate is slowly moving north It is moving about convert50mmin0lkonabbron every year It crashes into the Eurasia plate This has pushed up the ground and made the Himalaya mountains Some of the earths crust gets pushed into Sichuan and southern China This pushing has caused many earthquakes in China The epicentre was in the mountains on the eastern edge of the Qing Tibet Plateau This is on the north west edge of the Sichuan Basin The earthquake was caused by movement on a north east fault This is the Longmen Shan fault that runs along the edge of the basin

Office buildings in Shanghai including the Jin Mao Tower and the Hong Kong New World Tower were evacuated Emergency services in Chengdu could not answer all the phone calls  Workers at a Ford plant in Sichuan were evacuated for about 10 minutes The Chengdu airport was shut down One SilkAir flight was sent to land in nearby Kunming instead Cathay Pacific flights from Hong Kong to London were stopped Chengdu airport reopened as the airport was used for relief operations 

Reporters in Chengdu said they saw cracks in walls of some buildings In Beijing many office buildings were evacuated This included the building with the media offices for the 2008 Summer Olympics None of the Olympic venues were damaged A train with 13 petrol tanks came of the railway tracks in Huixian County Gansu Province and caught on fire The earthquake had twisted the rails

All of the highways into Wenchuan and others across Sichuan province were damaged This slowed down arrival of the rescue troops In Beichuan county 80 of the buildings collapsed In Shifang 2 chemical factories were damaged and leaked 80 tons of liquid ammonia The Dujiangyan Irrigation System a UNESCO World Heritage Site was damaged This is an ancient water system which is still in use The famous Fish Mouth was cracked

Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange stopped trading in companies based in south west China The price of copper rose because production stopped Oil prices dropped because people thought China would not need as much oil

Half of the wireless communications were lost in the Sichuan province China Mobile had more than lost 2300 base stations due to lack of power and too many phone calls China Unicoms service in Wenchuan and nearby areas were cut off with more than 700 phone towers out of action

Two pandas at a Giant Panda reserve were injured Two others went missing after the quake 

The Zipingpu hydro power station convert20kmmi0lkonabbron east of the epicenter was destroyed The dam wall cracked and the buildings collapsed The Tulong dam was in danger of bursting About 2000 troops were sent to Zipingpu to try and release the pressure through spillway In total 391 dams were damaged by the quake

By 18 May 2008 21 new lakes had formed in the Sichuan This was because the earthquake blocked rivers Villages had to be evacuated because of the flooding 

The Chinese government said the quake killed 69181 people including 68636 in Sichuan province There are 18498 people listed as missing 374171 people were injured This includes 158 workers who were killed in landslides as they tried to fix roads

One rescue team found only 2300 people still alive in Yingxiu Before the quake there had been about 9000 people there In Beichuan county 3000 to 5000 people were killed 10000 injured and 80 of the buildings were destroyed Eight schools fell down in Dujiangyan A 56 year old Taiwanese tourist was killed in Dujiangyan He was trying to rescue 11 tourists trapped on the Lingyanshan Ropeway Because of the earthquake they had been trapped inside the cable cars 

Thousands of school children died because of badly built schools least 1700 people At least 7000 school buildings collapsed Another 700 students were buried in a school in Hanwang At least 600 students and staff died at Juyuan Elementary School Up to 1300 children and teachers died at Beichuan Middle School

Because of Chinas one child policy many families lost their only child Officials in Sichuan province have removed the limit of one child for families whose only child was killed or badly injured So called illegal children under 18 years of age may be made a legal replacement for their dead brother or sister This may be too late for some as many of the parents are too old or unable to have children again

On May 29 2008 officials began looking at the ruins of thousands of schools that collapsed They were searching for clues about why they fell down Thousands of parents have said the government and builders did not build schools properly Many other nearby buildings were not damaged Parents of children killed in the schools say they have yet to receive any reportsLocal officials told them not to protest but the parents demonstrated and demanded an investigation The government censors have stopped stories of badly built schools from being published in the media There has been an incident where police drove away the protestors

Liu Shaokun a Sichuan school teacher was arrested on June 25 2008 He had been spreading rumors and destroying social order about the Sichuan Earthquake Liu had gone to the Shifang area taken photos of collapsed school buildings and put them online He had also said he was angry at the shoddy tofu buildings in a media interview He has been ordered to serve one year of re education through labor Because of complaints from the other countries Liu has been released to serve his RTL sentence outside of the labor camp

Safety checks are to be carried out at schools across China The National Development and Reform Commission are making new laws to improve building standards for primary and middle schools in rural areas

Insurance companies have put their losses at US1 billion from the earthquake The total cost of damage could be more than US20 billion Chengdu a city of 45 million people had a value of about US115 billion Only a small part was insured

The damage to buildings in the earthquake was because of Chinese building designs China did not have earthquake building rules until after the big Tangshan earthquake in 1976 Older buildings built before 1976 were not designed to stay up in an earthquake News reports showed that the poorer rural villages were hardest hit

Chinas President Hu Jintao said that help and assistance would be quick Premier Wen Jiabao immediately flew to the earthquake area to plan the rescue work

The Chinas Health Ministry sent 10 emergency medical teams The Chengdu Military Area Command sent 50000 troops and police to help in Wenchuan County A relief team of 184 people left Beijing 

Because of the mountains the soldiers found it very difficult to get help to the rural areas

Many rescue teams including the Taipei Fire Department from Taiwan said they were ready to help It was difficult to move people into the hardest hit areas closest to the epicenter It was not possible to reach the area because roads were damaged and blocked by landslides People needed tents medical supplies drinking water and food 

The small village of Sier could only be reached by walking Landslides were a danger to a search and rescue group of 80 men Each man carried about convert40kglb0lkonabbron of relief supplies The village is convert4000mft0lkonabbron above sea level The extreme mountain conditions meant they could not use helicopters Over 300 Tibetan villagers were stranded in the ruined village without food and water Commander Yang Wenyaos rescue group arrived after walking for 5 days and helped the injured and stranded villagers down the mountain

Heavy rain and landslides made rescue efforts difficult 20 helicopters were used on the first day to deliver food water emergency aid and carry injured people The next day 15600 troops from the Chengdu Military Region joined the rescue force Within 2 days telephones in the major town of Wenchuan were being fixed 100 soldiers along with relief supplies parachuted into inaccessible Maoxian County northeast of Wenchuan

Three days after the quake Chinas Premiere Wen Jiabao ordered another 90 helicopters A total of 150 aircraft were used in relief work This is Chinas largest ever non combat airlifting operation After the earthquake donations were made by people from all over China People gave money at schools banks and gas stations People also donated blood resulting in long line ups in most major Chinese cities

China stated it would gratefully accept international help to cope with the quake The Tzu Chi Foundation arrived from Taiwan on May 13 This was the first force from outside the Peoples Republic of China to join the rescue effort 100 tons of relief supplies donated by the Tzu Chi Foundation and the Red Cross Society of Taiwan arrived in Chengdu by May 15 

Francis Marcus of the International Federation of the Red Cross praised Chinas rescue effort as swift and very efficient He said the size of the disaster was so big that we cant expect that the government can do everything and handle every aspect of the needs The Economist said that China reacted to the disaster rapidly and with uncharacteristic openness This was different to Myanmars secretive response to Cyclone Nargis which struck the country 10 days before the earthquake

On May 16 rescue groups from South Korea Japan Singapore Russia and Taiwan arrived to join the rescue effort The United States shared some of its satellite images of the quake stricken areas with the Chinese government The US sent two US Air Force C 17s carrying supplies which included tents and generators 

The Internet has been used for passing information to help rescue and recovery in China For example the official Xinhua set up an online rescue request center in order to find the problems in disaster recovery When rescue helicopters had trouble in landing near the epicenter in Wenchuan a student proposed a new landing spot online Volunteers have also set up several websites to help store contact information for victims

The State Council declared 3 days of national mourning for the quake victims starting on May 19th 2008 The Chinese National Flag was raised to half mast It is the first time China had national mourning days for something other than the death of a state leader Many people say it the biggest display of mourning since the death of Mao At 1428 CST on May 19 2008 one week after the earthquake the Chinese public held a moment of silence People stood silent for 3 minutes Air defense police and fire sirens and the horns of vehicles vessels and trains sounded Cars on Beijings roads stopped After the silence in Tiananmen Square crowds began calling out Long Live China 

The Ningbo Organizing Committee of Beijing Olympic torch relay stopped the relay for 3 days 

Chinese websites changed their front pages to black and white Sinacom and Sohu changed their homepage to news items only and removed all advertisements Chinese video sharing websites youku and Tudou had a black background and only showed videos about the earthquake Other entertainment websites including gaming sites were blacked out Other websites had links to earthquake donations 

Chinese TV stations made their logo in gray They showed non stop earthquake footage from CCTV 1 Even pay television channels such as Channel V China also showed earthquake footage Some TV stations stopped showing commercials On May 18 CCTV 1 had a special 4 hour TV show called The Giving of Love Many famous people from China Hong Kong Singapore and Taiwan were on the show People watching gave about 15 billion Chinese Yuan for the victims The entertainers sang Tomorrow Will be Better followed by Faye Wong singing Wishing We Last Forever

Sir Frederick William Herschel FRS was a German born British astronomer the greatest observational astronomer of the day He is best known for discovering Uranus in 1781 He also discovered infrared radiation binary stars and published important catalogues of stars and nebulae Herschel built many telescopes including the largest in the world at that time

Herschel was also a musician in his younger days He played the cello oboe harpsichord and organ He composed numerous musical works including 24 symphonies and many concertos as well as some church music 

Herschel was born in the Electorate of Hanover one of ten children His father was of Jewish descent and an oboist in the Hannover Military Band In 1755 the Hannoverian Guards regiment in whose band Wilhelm and his brother Jakob were engaged as oboists was ordered to England At the time the crowns of Great Britain and Hanover were united under George II The next year the brothers resigned from the Guards band and moved to London to avoid the Seven Years Warp4 Wilhelm nineteen years old at this time learnt the English language quickly In England he went by the English version of his name Frederick William Herschel

Herschels music led him to an interest in mathematics and lenses His interest in astronomy grew stronger after 1773 and he made the acquaintance of the English Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne He started building his own reflecting telescopes and would spend up to 16 hours a day grinding and polishing the metal primary mirrors

When he discovered Uranus Herschel was not looking for a planet but doing a survey of stars it was an accidental discovery

It was the first discovery of a new planet since ancient times The first five Mercury Venus Mars Jupiter and Saturn are visible with the naked eye and have been known since early history Uranus was the first discovered by telescope Actually Uranus had been seen before by other observers with telescopes but had been marked on charts as a fixed star Herschel found it moved against the background of stars and at first thought it was a comet His measurements were used by the French mathematician Pierre Laplace who worked out its orbit and proved it was a planet

Herschel called the new planet the Georgian star after King George III which brought him favour the name did not stick however In France where reference to the British king was to be avoided if possible the planet was known as Herschel until the name Uranus was universally adopted The same year Herschel was awarded the Copley Medal and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society In 1782 he was appointed The Kings Astronomer He got a generous award from the king which enabled him to stop work as a musician and devote all his time to astronomy The award was a life pension to Herschel of 200 a year and 50 a year to Caroline Work on the 40 foot telescope was also supported by a grant from the kingp6

During the course of his career he constructed more than four hundred telescopes He was helped in this by his brother Alexander who like Caroline spent all his time working as Herschels assistant

The largest and most famous of his telescopes was a reflecting telescope with a convert48inmadjmid diameter main mirror and a 40 foot focal length This was the worlds largest telescope from 1789 until it was dismantled 50 years laterp6 The mirror was made of a hard metal alloy of tin and copper called speculum which he polished by hand

On 28 August 1789 his first night of observation using this instrument he discovered a new moon of Saturn A second moon followed within the first month of observation However the 40 foot telescope was awkward to use and most of his observations were done with a smaller convert185incmadjon convert20ftmadjmid focal length reflector 

He continued his work as a telescope maker selling many of them to other astronomers Together with his pension from the king the money helped support him and his two siblings in their work

Herschel used to work with his sister Caroline Herschel She recorded his observations as he made them In 1783 he gave Caroline a telescope and she began to make astronomical discoveries in her own right particularly comets 

Caroline discovered eight comets three nebulae and at her brothers suggestion updated and corrected Flamsteeds work on the position of stars This was published as the British Catalogue of Stars She was honoured by the Royal Astronomical Society for this work Caroline also continued to serve as his assistant

Herschel was the first to find out that some line of sight apparent double stars were actually true binary star systems where the two stars revolved around each other This was the first evidence that Newtons laws of gravitation apply outside the Solar System Herschel discovered 850 binary stars and worked up the first catalogue of binary stars His son John Herschel discovered many more and extended the catalogue

Herschel studied the changes in star position relative to the Solar System Changes do occur and quite rapidly for some nearby stars Also the whole Solar System moves and this was discovered by Herschel

From studying the proper motion of stars he was the first to realize that the solar system is moving through space He worked out the approximate direction of that movement He also studied the structure of the Milky Way and concluded that it was in the shape of a disk This was also a really significant discovery

On 11 February 1800 Herschel was testing filters for the sun so he could observe sun spots When using a red filter he found there was a lot of heat produced 

Herschel discovered infrared radiation by passing sunlight through a prism and holding a thermometer just beyond the red end of the visible spectrum This thermometer was meant to be a control to measure the ambient air temperature in the room He was shocked when it showed a higher temperature than the visible spectrum Further experimentation led to Herschels conclusion that there must be an invisible form of light beyond the visible spectrum

William Herschel and his wife Mary had one child John In 1816 William was made a Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order by the Prince Regent 

Herschel died at Observatory House Windsor Road Slough and is buried at nearby St Laurences Church Upton He died in his 84th year which is the same number of years Uranus takes to orbit the Sun His son John Herschel also became a famous astronomer His sister Caroline returned to Hanover Germany after the death of her brother She died on 9 January 1848 at the age of 97

His house at 19 New King Street in Bath Somerset where he made many telescopes and first observed Uranus is now home to the Herschel Museum of Astronomy

Quetzalcoatl is an Aztec sky and creator god The name is a combination of quetzalli a brightly colored Mesoamerican bird and broken wikt linkcoatlcoatl which means serpent The name was also taken on by several ancient Aztec leaders Many events and attributes attributed to Quetzalcoatl are exceedingly difficult to separate from the political leaders that took this name on themselves Quetzalcoatl is often referred to as the Feathered Serpent and was connected to the planet Venus He was also the patron god of the Aztec priesthood of learning and of knowledge Today Quetzalcoatl is arguably the best known Aztec deity but there were several other important Aztec gods too Tlaloc Tezcatlipoca and Huitzilopochtli 

Other Mesoamerican cultures have worshipped a feathered serpent god as well At Teotihuacan the several monumental structures have images of a feathered serpent One can see similar images at Chichn Itza and Tula This has led scholars to conclude that the deity called Quetzalcoatl in the Nahuatl language was among the most important deities of Mesoamerica

Pattern matching is a family of tools for finding similar objects in different sources In image processing the pattern matching is used for locating a small image in a bigger one For searching text regular expressions are commonly used

The simple way is to move the model in the target image and measure a similarity in each position The position with highest value of the similarity will be accepted as result The normalized correlation is used as a common metric for similarity 

The common way to reduce an amount of calculations is using the image pyramid When using the image pyramid the search is started on the reduced target image and results are improved in the next more detailed one This process is similar to the human vision

Telnet is a common network protocol used on the Internet and also inside a LAN It was developed in 1969 beginning with RFC 15 and is now defined as IETF STD 8 which is one of the first Internet standards However due to its lack of security Telnet has been replaced with Secure Shell on most servers

Telnet is one of the simplest ways to exchange data between two computers It allows two computers anywhere on a computer network including the worldwide Internet to exchange text and other data in real time It is still widely used for testing computer programs and is simple enough that it is included on most computers today But it allows many people to eavesdrop on the data exchange which is why it has mostly been replaced by SSH

Ofcom is the United Kingdoms regulatory body for telecommunications This means they are responsible for making sure that the law is followed by television and radio broadcasters

A Stirling engine is a kind of heat engine that converts heat into useful mechanical energy by the movement of a piston inside a cylinder within the engine Unlike other commonly found heat engines such as the internal combustion engine used in cars and the steam engine used on railways it re uses the same gas for each stroke of the piston so there is no noisy exhaust The same gas is repeatedly heated and cooled within the engines cylinder

To run it needs a supply of heat to heat its hot parts This can come from a fire but also from the suns rays from hot rocks near a volcano or from nuclear energy It also has cold parts which cool the gas inside it and these are kept cold by a stream of air or water flowing over them

It was invented by a Scottish minister Reverend Dr Robert Stirling in 1816

Corythosaurus is a genus of ornithopod was a large are plant eating duck billed dinosaur It was about 30 33 feet long 66 feet tall at the hips and may have weighed up to 5 tons It had a hollow bony crest on top of its long head in the shape of a helmet flattened on the sides Males had larger crests than females and juveniles

Loitering means to stand around without doing anything It can also mean to stop many times or to wait and procrastinate

Ornithopods are the infraorder of bird hipped dinosaurs They started out as small bipedal running grazers and grew in size and numbers until they became one of the most successful groups of herbivores in the Cretaceous world 

Their major evolutionary advantage was the progressive development of a chewing apparatus that became the most sophisticated ever developed by a reptile They had multiple teeth rows cheek pouches and true chewing Efficient chewing means faster digestion as the material is broken into smaller pieces

They reached their apex in the duck bills before they were wiped out by the CretaceousTertiary extinction event with all other non avian dinosaurs Members are known from all seven continents although the Antarctic remains are unnamed and they are generally rare in the Southern Hemisphere

They are the sister group to the horned dinosaurs and the hard headed dinosaurs

The duck bills started out as small bipedal running browsers and grew in size and numbers They became one of the most successful groups of herbivores in the Cretaceous world and dominated the landscape Their success is a perhaps surprising as they have little obvious defence against theropod carnivores They could run and had the usual defences of a herd animal They had horny beaks and some cartilage rib plates Iguanadons however could protect themselves They were very robust and armed with a dagger like thumb

Anglo Saxon architecture was a period in the history of architecture in England and parts of Wales from the mid 5th century until the Norman Conquest of 1066 Anglo Saxon buildings in Britain were generally simple made from wood with thatch for roofing

There are few remains of Anglo Saxon architecture At least fifty churches are of Anglo Saxon origin All surviving churches except one timber church are built of stone or brick

English Gothic is the name of the architectural style that was very popular in England from about 1180 until about 1520 As with the gothic architecture of other parts of Europe English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches vaulted roofs buttresses large windows and spires

The various styles are seen at their best in the cathedrals abbey churches and college buildings It is a distinctive characteristic of the cathedrals of England that all but one of them show great stylistic diversity and have building dates that typically range over 400 years The exception Salisbury Cathedral was built in 38 years

Examples Salisbury Cathedral Whitby Abbey the nave and transept of Wells Cathedral

The clearest sign of the Early English period was the pointed arch known as the lancet Pointed arches were used for nave arcade the doorways and lancet windows The windows are narrow by comparison to their height and are without tracery Lancet arches are a sign of the style 

The Lancet openings of windows and arcades are often grouped in twos or threes This is seen throughout Salisbury Cathedral where there are groups of two lancet windows lining the nave and groups of three lining the clerestory At York Minster there are in the north transept a cluster of five lancet windows known as the Five Sisters each fifty feet high and still have their ancient glass

Romanesque builders generally used round arches Compared with the rounded Romanesque style the pointed arch of the Early English Gothic looks more elegant and more importantly is better at distributing the weight of the stonework above it This makes it possible to span higher and wider gaps using narrower columns

Instead of being massive solid pillars the columns were often composed of clusters of slender detached shafts surrounding a central pillar 

By using the pointed arch walls could become less massive and window openings could be larger and grouped more closely together This gave a more open airy and graceful building The high walls and vaulted stone roofs were often supported by flying buttresses half arches which transmit the outward thrust of the superstructure to supports or buttresses usually on the outside of the building

At its purest the style was simple and austere emphasising the height of the building as if aspiring heavenward

Examples the east ends of Lincoln Cathedral and Carlisle Cathedral and the west fronts of York Minster and Lichfield Cathedral Much of Exeter Cathedral is built in this style

Decorated architecture has window tracery Elaborate windows are subdivided by closely spaced parallel mullions The mullions then branch out and cross intersecting to fill the top part of the window with a mesh of elaborate patterns called tracery The style was geometrical at first and flowing in the later period This evolution of decorated tracery is often used to subdivide the period into an earlier Geometric and later Curvilinear period

Some of the earliest examples of the Perpendicular Period dating from 1360 are found at Gloucester Cathedral where the masons of the cathedral would seem to have been far in advance of those in other towns the fan vaulting in the cloisters is particularly fine Also noteworthy are the Quire and tower of York Minster the nave and western transepts of Canterbury Cathedral Bath Abbey Eton College Chapel and Kings College Chapel Cambridge are also examples

So called because it is characterised by an emphasis on vertical lines This is particularly obvious in the design of windows which became very large sometimes of immense size with slimmer stone mullions than in earlier periods This allowed more scope for stained glass craftsmen Buttresses and wall surfaces are likewise divided up into vertical panels Another major development of this period was fan vaulting

Some of the finest features of this period are the magnificent timber roofs hammerbeam roofs such as those of Westminster Hall and Christ Church Hall Oxford appeared for the first time In areas of Southern England using flint architecture elaborate decoration in flint was used especially in the wool churches of East Anglia

Salisbury Cathedral is an Anglican cathedral in Salisbury Wiltshire England The main body was completed in only 38 years starting in 1220 It is considered to be one of the leading examples of Early English architecture

The cathedral has the tallest church spire in the United Kingdom Visitors can take the Tower Tour where the interior of the hollow spire with its ancient wood scaffolding can be seen The cathedral also has the largest cloister and the largest cathedral precinct in Britain The Cathedral contains the worlds oldest working clock It also has one of the four surviving original copies of the Magna Carta 

Although commonly known as Salisbury Cathedral the official name is the Cathedral of Saint Mary In 2008 the cathedral celebrated the 750th anniversary of its consecration in 1258 It the seat of the Bishop of Salisbury the Rt Revd David Stancliffe

The whole of Salisbury Cathedral is in the Early English style Slim pointed vertical lancet windows are used throughout The image is simple and pure There is little or no embellishing and less detailed tracery than would be used in later buildings This is characteristic of the Early English style roughly 1190 to 1310 The consistency of style was achieved by the rapidity of the building

The foundation stone was laid on 28 April 1220 Due to the high water level in the new location the cathedral was built on only four feet of foundation By 1258 the nave transepts and quire were complete The west front was ready by 1265 The cloisters and chapter house were completed around 1280 Because the cathedral was built in only 38 years Salisbury Cathedral has a single consistent architectural style English Gothic architecture

The only major parts of the cathedral built later were the Cloisters Chapter House tower and spire which at 404 feet dominates the skyline Whilst the spire is the cathedrals most impressive feature it has also proved to be troublesome Together with the tower it added 6397 tons to the weight of the building Without the later addition of buttresses bracing arches and iron ties it would have fallen down as spires on other great buildings have done Instead Salisbury is said to be the tallest surviving pre 1400 spire in the world To this day the large supporting pillars at the corners of the spire are bent inwards under the stress

The Chapter House is notable for its octagonal shape slender central pillar and decorative medival frieze The frieze circles the interior just above the stalls It shows scenes and stories from the books of Genesis and Exodus The chapter house displays the best preserved of the four surviving original copies of Magna Carta This copy came to Salisbury because Elias of Dereham was present at the meeting with King John at Runnymede in 1215 He was given the task of distributing some of the original copies Later Elias became a Canon of Salisbury and supervised the construction of Salisbury Cathedral

A fan vault is a form of vault used in the Perpendicular Gothic style All its ribs are of the same curve and spaced the same

This beautiful and elegant Gothic style of architecture at its earliest appears in 1351 stub

Gert Fram is a short story that was written by Orson Scott Card in 1977 It is in his short story collection Maps in a Mirror This short story was the first story Card wrote It first came out in the July 1977 fine arts issue of Ensign magazine under the pen name Byron Walley

The Vezina Trophy is awarded every year to the National Hockey Leagues goaltender who is chosen as the best goaltender At the end of each season the 30 General Managers of the teams in the National Hockey League vote to determine the goaltender who was the most valuable to his team during the regular season Before 1981 it was awarded to the goaltender of the team allowing the fewest number of goals during the regular season now the William M Jennings Trophy is awarded under this previous definition

The Vezina Trophy was named for Georges Vzina a very good goaltender with the Montreal Canadiens Vezina felt sick during a game in 1925 because he had tuberculosis When Vezina died the trophy was given to the League by the former owners of the Montreal Canadiens Leo Dandurand Louis Letourneau and Joe Cattarinich It was first awarded at the end of the 1926 27 NHL season

Until the 198081 season the trophy was awarded to the goaltender of the team that gave up the least goals during the regular season However it was recognized that this system often meant the trophy went to the goaltender of the better team rather than the individual and hence the change was made to offer the William M Jennings Trophy to the goaltender playing for the team with the fewest goals against Since 1981 the Vezina Trophy has been awarded by the NHL General Managers to the most outstanding goaltender Billy Smith of the New York Islanders was the first winner of the Vezina under the current system

There have been numerous instances of players receiving the trophy many times in different years and players tying for the trophy Jacques Plante holds the record for winning the most Vezinas with seven trailed by Bill Durnan and Dominik Hasek both of who have won six Hasek has won the most under the current system of honouring the best individual goalie Players for the Montreal Canadiens have won the Vezina 28 times Under the original definition there would often be multiple winners from the same team during one season In the 1973 74 NHL season Tony Esposito of the Chicago Black Hawks and Bernie Parent of the Philadelphia Flyers finished tied for the fewest goals against the only time that there would be a tie between two players from different teams There are only three players that have won both the Vezina and Hart Memorial Trophy for the same season Jacques Plante who won both trophies for the 196162 season Dominik Hasek who won both for the 199697 and 199798 seasons and Jose Theodore who won the Vezina and Hart for the 2001 02 NHL season Two other Vezina winning goaltenders have also won the Hart Memorial Trophy Roy Worters and Al Rollins Chuck Rayner was the only goaltender to win the Hart Memorial Trophy but never the Vezina

The voting is conducted at the end of the regular season by the 30 general managers of the teams in the National Hockey League and each individual voter ranks their top three candidates on a 5 3 1 points system Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the playoffs

When introduced the Vezina Trophy was awarded to the goaltender or goaltenders of the team that gave up the fewest goals in regular season play

The NHL adopted the current criteria for the Vezina Trophy beginning in 1982 The William M Jennings Trophy was created as a new award for the goaltender of the team that surrenders the fewest goals in regular season play

A Trireme is an ancient oar driven warship powered by about 170 oars men It was long and slender had three tiers of oars and one sail One the bow was a battering ram that was used to destroy enemy ships The tip of the ram was made of bronze and could easily slice through the side of a wooden ship

The Trireme was used by people of the Mediterranean Sea from the 7th to the 4th century BC and gets its name from its three rows of oars on each side manned with one man per oar The rowing men were not slaves but were free men who were paid to row In Ancient Greece soldiers had to buy their own weapons so men too poor to afford them became trireme rowers in wartime They had to have a lot of practice at rowing as during a battle the ship had to be able to quickly stop start and manoeuvre 

As well as the rowing men there were 30 others on a trireme Some of these were sailors who worked the sail others were soldiers who shot arrows and tried to get onto enemy ships to attack their crews with swords and spears The man who steered the trireme was called a kubernete by the Greeks From this we get the English word Governor for a person who leads a state 

Because there were many men crowded onto a small ship triremes could not stay at sea very long Often they came to land each evening The crew would pull the trireme out of the water and then sleep next to it on the beach 

Before a battle the mast and sail were taken off and left on the shore In battle triremes would attempt to ram or board each other Some triremes had catapults and ballistas on them but they were hard to use in battle Many ancient sea battles involved hundreds of triremes In the Battle of Salamis there were around 360 ships on the Greek side and 600 to 800 ships on the Persian side

The World Wrestling Entertainment Draft Lottery also known as the World Wrestling Entertainment Draft is a device used to provide new brand competition and to refreshen the promotions rosters The Draft was first used during the brand extension of 2002 and the brand extension of 2006 but was officially created and used in 2004 2005 2007 and 2008

On June 10 2002 McMahon became the kayfabe sole owner of World Wrestling Entertainment when he beat Ric Flair in a No Holds Barred match The following month he named general managers to lead each brand Since then there have been five further drafts

Whether a champion keeps their championship after being drafted is unpredictable During the 2005 Draft John Cena the WWE Champion was drafted from SmackDown to RAW and kept his championship General Manager Theodore Long announced that a new SmackDown World Championship was to be created but the idea was abandoned when Batista the World Heavyweight Champion was drafted to SmackDown from RAW bringing the title with him During the 2007 Draft however the ECW World Champion Bobby Lashley was stripped of the title after being drafted to RAW

In the 2008 draft ECW Champion Kane was drafted to RAW WWE Champion Triple H was drafted to SmackDown WWE United States Champion Matt Hardy was drafted to ECW This caused SmackDown to have two championships and RAW had the ECW Championship ECW had no top championship but did gain the United States Championship The World Heavyweight Championship was moved back to RAW on June 30 2008 when CM Punk defeated Edge ECW wrestler Mark Henry won the ECW championship on June 29 2008 at the Night of Champions pay per view to return that championship to ECW This caused each brand to have its own top championship once again

The Le Chteliers principle is a principle used in chemistry It is a system that tries to make up for the changes that affect the system at equilibrium

It is used to see the effects of relations between concentration pressure and temperature If a change of condition is added onto a system at equilibrium the equilibrium position will shift in the direction that wants to reduce that change

Equilibrium is measured by concentration of a chemistry substance If there is more concentration the extra material must be used up to try to set the change back at equilibrium It tries to fill the void

Pressure is applied to an airy substance called gas If there is more pressure the system will take away the number of molecules leaving with fewer gas molecules

If heat is added the system moves away from heat so it can use it up In an endothermic reaction if temperature is increased then the products will increase in order to stabilize this change in the reaction In an exothermic reaction its in abundance in its products egenergy If temperature is increased then the reactants will increase to balance out reaction

The Scissor tailed Flycatcher is a long tailed bug eating bird closely related to the kingbirds It is also the state bird of Oklahoma

It was officially adopted by the State Legislature May 5 1951 as the Oklahoma state bird The common name is derived from its former Latin name Muscivoria forficata meaning flying scissors and to devour In Oklahoma scissortails can be found on open prairies along tree lined roads and along roadsides perched on fences limbs and in isolated trees They consume a great number of grasshoppers crickets spiders and other ground dwelling insects making them economically important and popular with farmers and ranchers

Soon after the birds arrive in the state the males begin their famous sky dance a popular site along roadsides during spring and early summer After climbing about 100 feet in the air the male makes a series of V shaped flights then plunges down in an erratic zigzag course often somersaulting while uttering a rolling cackling call The performance has been described as an aerial ballet of incomparable grace Nesting usually takes place in an isolated tree 730 feet above ground Often two broods of 4 6 each are raised during the summer

Scissor tailed flycatchers are easily identified by their long scissor like tail which may reach nine inches in length During flight the bird opens its tail like a pair of scissors and folds or closes the scissors when perching The nape of its neck and its back are pearl gray and the breast is white Wings are sooty black with a touch of scarlet at the shoulders The principal threat to scissortails is poaching A great number of birds have been killed by poachers who wanted only the birds tail

Cassowaries are a genus of large birds which cannot fly They are part of a group of flightless birds called the ratites The ostrich emu moa and small kiwi are other ratites 

The cassowary lives in the tropical rainforests of New Guinea and north eastern Australia They are shy birds living deep in the forest They can also become angry and they will attack people This makes it hard to learn about them

There are three living species of cassowary

The Southern Cassowary is the largest forest bird in the world and the second heaviest bird in the world after the ostrich It is third tallest after the ostrich and emu Females are bigger and more brightly coloured Adult Southern Cassowaries are between convert15mft0lkonabbron to convert18mft0lkonabbron tall Some females may get as big as convert2mft0lkonabbron and weigh about convert70kglb0lkonabbron They do not have feathers on their necks The necks are brightly colored in red blue purple and yellow The Southern Cassowary has two wattles loose skin which hangs down from their neck The Northern Cassowary has one wattle The Dwarf Cassowary has no wattles

Cassowaries have three toes on each foot Each has a sharp claw The middle toe has a claw like a dagger which is convert120mmin0lkonabbron long Because a cassowary can kick this claw is very dangerous and can hurt or kill enemies Scientists believe they can run up to convert50kmhmph0lkonabbron They can jump up to convert15mft0lkonabbron and they can swim There have been reported attacks on people and animals by cassowaries In April 1926 a cassowary killed a 16 year old boy near Mossman Queensland

The cassowarys wings are small and are not flight feathers They are not adapted for flying

Females lay between three and eight large pale green blue eggs at a time These large eggs are about convert90mmin0lkonabbron by convert140mmin0lkonabbron and weigh about 600 grams Ostrich and emu eggs are bigger The male sits on the eggs for two months until they hatch He then looks after the brown striped chicks for nine months The female mates with two or three males each year A cassowary at the Healesville Sanctuary lived for 61 years

All three types of cassowary have a horn like helmet called a casque on the top of their head The casque is a keratinous skin over an inside made of firm but foam like material This material can be bent and squeezed but it goes back to its proper shape The name cassowary comes from two Papuan words meaning horned head The reason for the casque is unknown There are a number of different ideas such as

Biologist Andrew Mack has watched cassowaries and disagreed with many of these ideas He thinks that the casques play a part in the way cassowaries hear sounds or the way that they make sounds He discovered that the Dwarf Cassowary and Southern Cassowary make a very low sound It is the lowest known bird call like a boom which people can only just hear The Southern Cassowary sound was measured at 32 hertz and the Dwarf Cassowary was even lower at only 23 hertz The birds live by themselves they do not live in groups so the booming sound might be a way for the birds to communicate over a long distance in thick rainforest Scientists think that this way of talking may be how dinosaurs communicated with each other

Their main food is fruit but they eat other things such as snails fungi ferns and flowers They are important because they spread plant and fruit seeds through the forest Each cassowary is known to live in an area of up to convert700haacre0lkonabbron so they carry seeds a long way At least 70 rainforest trees need the cassowary to spread their seeds Their seeds are too big for other rainforest animals to carry Seeds from 21 plants have to be eaten and pass through the cassowary or they will not grow Some seeds are poisonous to all other animals only the cassowary can eat them Scientists have worked out that about 150 rainforest plants need the cassowary

The Southern Cassowary is now listed as endangered in Australia Scientists think there are only between 1200 and 1500 cassowaries left in Australia Many of the forest places that they like to live in have been cleared for farming and other development It has been worked out that 75 of rain forest where cassowaries used to live have been cleared in Australia When Cyclone Larry hit the Mission Beach area in 2006 a lot of cassowary forest was flattened It is thought that 18 of the birds were killed by the storm Animals such as wild pigs dogs and cats have become a big threat to the birds Motor cars are a big danger to the birds Scientists say that 70 of known cassowary deaths at Mission Beach Queensland were birds killed trying to cross roads

The Northern Cassowary in New Guinea is listed as vulnerable They could easily become an endangered animal unless things are done to protect them Scientists do not know how many birds there are but they think there may be anywhere from 2500 to 9999 Northern Cassowaries left

The CSIRO are studying cassowary faeces to see if they can use their DNA to count how many birds are left In 2008 the Australian Government stopped rainforest land being used to build houses at Mission Beach They are going to try and keep corridors so the birds can move between rainforest areas safely People will be asked to replant forest trees and plants on their land to help make these corridors The government is looking at buying land for more corridors Scientists are finding out when and where cassowaries cross roads This will mean strict limits on motor car speeds to protect cassowaries that might try to cross some roads Plans are being looked at to build raised roads so the birds can pass underneath

Many zoos such as the Australian Reptile Park in Gosford the Airlie Beach Wildlife Park and the Denver Zoo are trying to breed cassowaries Cassowaries in zoos have lived for up to 60 years The first cassowary kept in a zoo was in Amsterdam in 1597 It had been brought back as a present for the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II

In 2007 Australian singer Christine Anu made an album called Chrissys Island Family This is a collection of songs for children One of the songs is called Cassowary It is about Samu the Wakka Woo Cassowary There is picture book for children called Sisi and the Cassowary by Arone Raymond Meeks It has drawings in traditional aboriginal style to tell a Dreamtime like story

English natural history writer and artist John Gould had drawings of the cassowary in his set of seven books called The Birds of Australia These were printed in London between 1851 and 1869 The cassowary drawings were completed by Henry Richter Richters watercolor painting of the cassowary is in the museum in Melbourne Victoria

The Deinonychosauria is a clade of theropods in the Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous The largest known of these was Utahraptor and Anchiornis was the smallest

The Dromaeosauridae includes some of the most fearsome killers of the Cretaceous Period Deinonychus Velociraptor and Utahraptor Troodontids date from the Upper Cretaceous and were lighter and slimmer than the dromaeosaurids Some of these were Troodon and Saurornithoides

Dromaeosaurs are family of bird like theropod dinosaurs which included the famous Velociraptor They were small to medium sized feathered carnivores which flourished in the Cretaceous period 

They are often called raptors a term popularized by the film Jurassic Park They were fast running predators

Dromaeosaurs had a world wide distribution They first appeared in the Middle Jurassic 167 million years ago The larger types are not found before about 124 mya in the Lower Cretaceous and are only found in the northern hemisphere They survived until the end of the Cretaceous 655 mya at the KT extinction event 

The presence of dromaeosaurs in the Middle Jurassic is shown by isolated fossil teeth though no dromaeosaurid body fossils have been found this early

The Dromaeosaur skeleton sugests they were active fast running and closely related to birds 

Dromaeosaurs have a relatively large skull serrated teeth narrow snout and forward facing eyes with some degree of binocular vision

Dromaeosaurs like most other theropods had an S curved neck and their trunk was relatively short and deep Like other maniraptorans they had long arms and relatively large hands with three long fingers ending in large claws 

The dromaeosaur hip structure featured a large pubic boot projecting beneath the base of the tail These hip bones were places muscle and tendons attached 

Dromaeosaur feet bore a large recurved claw on the second toe Their tails were slender and mainly used as a counter balance

Some and probably all dromaeosaurs were covered in feathers including large vaned wing and tail feathers This development first proposed in the mid late 1980s was confirmed by fossil discoveries in 1999 It is a significant change in the way dromaeosaurs have been depicted in art and film

Like other theropods dromaeosaurs were bipedal that is they walked on their hind legs Whereas other theropods walked with three toes on the ground fossilized footprint tracks show that most dromaeosaurs held the second toe off the ground with only the third and fourth toes bearing the weight of the animal The enlarged second toe bore an unusually large curved sickle shaped claw It is thought to have been used in capturing prey and in the smaller species climbing trees 

One dromaeosaur species Balaur bondoc had a first toe which was highly modified in parallel with the second Both the first and second toes on each foot of B bondoc were also held retracted and bore enlarged sickle shaped claws

Dromaeosaurs had long tails Most of the tail vertebrae bear bony rod like extensions as well as bony tendons in some species In his study of Deinonychus Ostrom proposed that these features stiffened the tail so that it could only flex at the base and the whole tail would then move as a single rigid lever However one well preserved specimen of Velociraptor mongoliensis has an articulated tail skeleton which is curved horizontally in an S shape This suggests that in life the tail could bend from side to side with some degree of flexibility It has been proposed that this tail was used as a stabilizer andor counterweight while running In Microraptor an elongate diamond shaped fan of feathers is preserved on the end of the tail This might have been used as a stabilizer and rudder during gliding

Dromaeosaurs were small to medium sized dinosaurs ranging from about 07 meters in length to over 6m Some were larger undescribed specimens of Utahraptor in BYU collections may have been up to convert11mftabbron long Large size appears to have evolved at least twice among dromaeosaurs A possible third lineage of giant dromaeosaurs is represented by isolated teeth found on the Isle of Wight England The teeth belong to a Utahraptor sized animal but are more similar in shape to the teeth of velociraptorines

Mahakala is both the most primitive dromaeosaur ever described and the smallest This evidence and Microraptor and the troodontid Anchiornis suggests the common ancestor of dromaeosaurs troodontids and birds the ancestral paravian may have been very small at around 65 cm in length and 600 to 700 grams of mass

Fossils show that dromaeosaurs were covered in feathers Some fossils preserve long feathers on the hands and arms and tail as well as shorter down like feathers covering the body 

Other fossils which do not preserve actual impressions of feathers still preserve the associated bumps on the forearm bones where long wing feathers would have attached in life Overall this feather pattern looks very much like Archaeopteryx

The first known dromaeosaur with definitive evidence of feathers was Sinornithosaurus reported from China by Xu et al in 1999 

Many other dromaeosaur fossils have been found with feathers covering their bodies some with fully developed feathered wings Microraptor even shows evidence of a second pair of wings on the hind legs While direct feather impressions are only possible in fine grained sediments some fossils found in coarser rocks show evidence of feathers by the presence of quill knobs the attachment points for wing feathers possessed by some birds The dromaeosaurids Rahonavis and Velociraptor have both been found with quill knobs showing that these forms had feathers despite no impressions having been found 

In light of this it is most likely that even the larger ground dwelling dromaeosaurs bore feathers since even flightless birds today retain most of their plumage and relatively large dromaeosaurs like Velociraptor are known to have had feathers

There is some discussion about the function of the enlarged sickle claw on the second toe When John Ostrom described it for Deinonychus in 1969 he interpreted the claw as a blade like slashing weapon much like the canines of some saber toothed cats used with powerful kicks to cut into prey Adams suggested that the talon was used to disembowel large ceratopsian dinosaurs The interpretation of the sickle claw as a killing weapon applied to all dromaeosaurs 

In Mannings interpretation the second toe claw would be used as a climbing aid when subduing bigger prey and also as stabbing weapon 

Ostrom compared Deinonychus to the ostrich and cassowary He noted that the bird species can inflict serious injury with the large claw on the second toe The cassowary has claws up to convert125mmin long The seriema also has an enlarged second toe claw and uses it to tear apart small prey items for swallowing

The Manning team also compared the curvature of the dromaeosarid sickle claw on the foot with curvature in modern birds and mammals Previous studies had shown that the amount of curvature in a claw corresponded to what lifestyle the animal has animals with strongly curved claws of a certain shape tend to be climbers while straighter claws indicate ground dwelling lifestyles The sickle claws of the dromaeosaurid Deinonychus have a curvature of 160 degrees well within the range of climbing animals The forelimb claws they studied also fell within the climbing range of curvature

Paleontologist Peter Mackovicky said that small primitive dromaeosaurids were likely to have been tree climbers but that climbing did not explain why later gigantic dromaeosaurids such as Achillobator retained highly curved claws when they were too large to have climbed trees

Deinonychus fossils have been uncovered in small groups near the remains of the herbivore Tenontosaurus a larger ornithischian dinosaur This had been interpreted as evidence that these dromaeosaurs hunted in coordinated packs like some modern mammals However not all paleontologists found the evidence conclusive and a study in 2007 by Roach and Brinkman suggests that the Deinonychus may have actually displayed a disorganized mobbing behavior 

The first known extensive dromaeosaur trackway was found in Shandong China 

The trackway showed the sickle claw was held off the ground Six individuals of about equal size moved together along a shoreline The individuals were spaced about one meter apart and retained the same direction of travel walking at a fairly slow pace The trackways are evidence that some species of dromaeosaurs lived in groups While the trackways clearly do not represent hunting behavior the idea that groups of dromaeosaurs may have hunted together can not be ruled out

The ability to fly or glide has been suggested for at least two dromaeosaur genera The first Rahonavis ostromi was originally classified as avian bird but found to be a dromaeosaur in later studies It may have been capable of powered flight The forelimbs of Rahonavis were more powerfully built than Archaeopteryx and show evidence that they bore strong ligament attachments necessary for flapping flight Luis Chiappe concluded that given these adaptations Rahonavis could probably fly but would have been more clumsy in the air than modern birds

Another species of dromaeosaur Microraptor gui may have been capable of gliding using its well developed wings on both the fore and hind limbs A 2005 study by Sankar Chatterjee suggested that the wings of Microraptor functioned like a split level biplane and that it likely employed a style of gliding in which it would launch from a perch and swoop downward in a U shaped curve then lift again to land on another tree with the tail and hind wings helping to control its position and speed Chatterjee also found that Microraptor had the basic requirements to sustain level powered flight in addition to gliding

Dromaeosaurs share many features with early birds The nature of their relationship to birds is under discussion 

Mark Norell and colleagues analyzed a survey of coelurosaur fossils and suggested that dromaeosaurs were most closely related to birds with troodontids as a more distant outgroup In 2002 Hwang and colleagues suggested that birds were better thought of as cousins to the dromaeosaurids and troodontids

The current consensus among paleontologists agrees with Hwang that dromaeosaurids are most closely related to the troodontids and together with the troodontids form the clade Deinonychosauria Deinonychosaurians in turn are the sister taxon to avialans and therefore the closest relatives of avialan birds 

A consensus of paleontologists has concluded that there is not yet enough evidence to say whether any dromaeosaurs could fly or glide or whether they evolved from ancestors that could

At least two schools of researchers have proposed that dromaeosaurs may actually be descended from flying ancestors 

In 2002 Hwang et al found that Microraptor was the most primitive dromaeosaur Xu and colleagues in 2003 cited the basal position of Microraptor along with feather and wing features as evidence that the ancestral dromaeosaur could glide In that case the larger dromaeosaurs would be secondarily terrestrialhaving lost the ability to glide later in their evolutionary history

A few researchers like Larry Martin believe that dromaeosaurs along with all maniraptorans are not dinosaurs at all Martin asserted for decades that birds were unrelated to maniraptorans but in 2004 he changed his position and now he agrees that the two are the closest of relatives Martin believes that maniraptorans are secondarily flightless birds and that birds evolved from nondinosaurian archosaurs so that most of the species formerly called theropods would now not even be classified as dinosaurs

A challenge to all of these alternative scenarios came when Turner and colleagues in 2007 described a new dromaeosaur Mahakala which they found to be the most basal and most primitive member of the Dromaeosauridae more primitive than Microraptor 

Mahakala had short arms and no ability to glide Turner et al also inferred that flight evolved only in the Avialae and these two points suggested that the ancestral dromaeosaurid could not glide or fly Based on this cladistic analysis Mahakala suggests that the ancestral condition for dromaeosaurids is non flying

The family Dromaeosauridae was named in 1922 with only one new genus Dromaeosaurus Dromaeosauridae along with Troodontidae make up the infraorder Deinonychosauria

Dromaeosauridae was first defined as a clade by Paul Sereno in 1998 as the most inclusive natural group containing Dromaeosaurus but not Troodon Ornithomimus or Passer The various subfamilies have also been re defined as clades

The subfamilies of Dromaeosauridae is not yet settled Mahakala for example the most primitive dromaeosaur in terms of structure falls outside any named sub group The most basal subfamily of dromaeosaurs is often found to be the Unenlagiinae 

All known dromaeosaur skin impressions come from this group and all show an extensive covering of feathers and well developed wings Some species may have been capable of active flight 

The following classification of the various genera of dromaeosaurids is based on studies by Sereno Senter Makovicky et al Norell et al and Turner et al

In general velociraptorines tend to have longer narrower jaws and more slender bodily proportions than the dromaeosaurines

A Deinonychus appears in John Brosnans 1984 novel Carnosaur and its film adaptation though the book itself received little press attention 

Velociraptor a dromaeosaur got attention after it was featured in the 1993 Steven Spielberg film Jurassic Park However the size of the Velociraptor in the film is much larger than the largest members of that genus Robert Bakker recalled that Spielberg had been disappointed with the dimensions of Velociraptor and so upsized it adding that soon afterwards he named Utahraptor which was more the size depicted or larger 

Michael Crichton used the name Velociraptor for the much larger raptor in his novels on which the first two films were based The depiction of the dromaeosaur in the original Jurassic Park film while accurate for its time is now known to have been inaccurate in some respects such as the lack of feathers While Jurassic Park III attempted to address this last oversight by adding quill like structures around the head of some of its dromaeosaurs they did not resemble the structure or distribution of actual dromaeosaurid feathers known from fossil remains

Dromaeosaurids also appear in many of The Land Before Time films beginning with the third

Irritator is a genus of theropod dinosaur which was discovered in the Lower Cretaceous of the Santana Formation 

The first identifiable dinosaur from Brazil and the first non avian from South America Irritator has teeth similar to Spinosaurus It has a slender jaw with nostrils well back from the front of the snout It also had a large crest on the quadrate bone on top of the skull It was named due to the feelings of the scientists who described it when they found that the snout had been artificially lengthened to resemble a plesiosaur

Jack Roosevelt Jackie Robinson was the first African American Major League Baseball player of the modern times Robinson broke the baseball color line when he debuted with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947 He was the first black man to openly play in the major leagues since the 1880s He had a big role in bringing an end to racial segregation in professional baseball Up to that point African Americans could only play in Negro leagues for six decades His character and skills challenged the usual basis of segregation At the time this basis was part of many other pieces of American life Robinson and his abilities contributed a lot to the civil rights movement

Apart from his cultural impact Robinson had an overall good baseball career Over ten seasons he played in six World Series and helped in the Dodgers 1955 World Championship He was selected for six consecutive All Star Games from 1949 to 1954 Robinson received the first MLB Rookie of the Year Award in 1947 He also won the National League Most Valuable Player Award in 1949 He was the first black player to win this award Robinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962 In 1997 Major League Baseball retired his uniform number 42 across all major league teams

Robinson was also known for his activities outside of baseball He was the first African American television analyst in Major League Baseball He was also the first African American vice president of a major American company In the 1960s he helped establish the Freedom National Bank an African American ownedcontrolled financial business based in Harlem New York In honor of his achievements on and off the field Robinson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal after his death

Robinson was born on January 31 1919 His family were sharecroppers in Cairo Georgia He was born during a Spanish flu and smallpox epidemic He was the youngest of five children after siblings Edgar Frank Matthew and Willa Mae His middle name was in honor of former President Theodore Roosevelt who died twenty five days before Robinson was born After Robinsons father left the family in 1920 they moved to Pasadena California The Robinson family lived on a plot with two small houses at 121 Pepper Street in Pasadena Robinsons mother worked different odd jobs to support the family Robinson grew up somewhat poor in a fairly rich community Because of this Robinson and his minority friends were left out of many sports activities As a result Robinson joined a neighborhood gang However his friend Carl Anderson made him leave it

In 1935 Robinson graduated from Washington Junior High School He then entered Muir Tech Seeing that Robinson was good at sports his older brothers Mack and Frank inspired Jackie to follow his interest in sports At Muir Tech Robinson played several sports at the varsity level Robinson lettered in four of them football basketball track and baseball He played shortstop and catcher on the baseball team quarterback on the football team and guard on the basketball team With the track and field team he won awards in the broad jump He was also part of the tennis team

In 1936 Robinson won the junior boys singles championship in the yearly Pacific Coast Negro Tennis Tournament He also won a place on the Pomona baseball tournament all star team That team included future Hall of Famers Ted Williams and Bob Lemon In late January 1937 the Pasadena Star News newspaper wrote that Robinson for two years has been the outstanding athlete at Muir starring in football basketball track baseball and tennis

After Muir Robinson went to Pasadena Junior College There he continued his sports career by playing basketball football baseball and trackJackie Robinson was one of the best athletes at Pasadena Junior College On the football team he played quarterback and safety He was a shortstop and leadoff hitter for the baseball team He broke school broad jump records held by his brother Mack As at Muir Hugh School most of Jackies teammates were white While playing football at PJC Robinson fractured his ankle Issues from this would later delay his deployment status while in the military Also while at PJC he was elected to the Lancers They were a student run police group who patrolled various school activities In 1938 he was elected to the All Southland Junior College Team for baseball He was also selected as the regions Most Valuable Player That year Robinson was one of ten students named to the schools Order of the Mast and Dagger This was awarded to students performing outstanding service to the school and whose scholastic and citizenship record is worthy of recognition

An event at PJC shown Robinsons impatience with people he felt were racist This character trait that would come up several times in his life On January 25 1938 he was arrested after he argued against his black friend being taken away by police Robinson received a two year suspended sentence The incident along with other possible run ins between Robinson and police gave Robinson a reputation for getting upset in the face of racial problems Toward the end of his PJC career Frank Robinson was killed in a motorcycle accident The event motivated Jackie to pursue his athletic career at the University of California Los Angeles where he could remain closer to Franks family

In 1942 Robinson was drafted and assigned to a segregated Army cavalry unit in Fort Riley Kansas Having the necessary requirements Robinson and several other black soldiers applied for entrance to an Officer Candidate School then located at Fort Riley Although Army policy had allowed black applicants to enter OCS since July 1941 the applications of Robinson and his colleagues were delayed for several months After protests by boxing champion Joe Louis and the help of Truman Gibson the men were accepted into OCS This shared military experience created a friendship between Robinson and Louis Upon finishing OCS Robinson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in January 1943 Shortly afterward Robinson and Isum were engaged

After receiving his commission Robinson was moved to Fort Hood Texas There he joined the 761st Black Panthers Tank Battalion While at Fort Hood Robinson often used his weekend leave to visit the Rev Karl Downs President of Sam Huston College in nearby Austin Texas Downs had been Robinsons pastor at Scott United Methodist Church while Robinson attended PJC

An event in July 1944 stopped Robinsons military career While waiting for results of hospital tests on the ankle he had injured in junior college Robinson got on an Army bus with a fellow officers wife Although the Army had its own unsegregated bus line the bus driver ordered Robinson to move to the back of the bus Robinson refused The driver backed down However after reaching the end of the line he got the military police who took Robinson into custody Robinson later talked to the duty officer about racist questioning by the officer and his assistant The officer then recommended Robinson be court martialed After Robinsons commander in the 761st Paul L Bates refused to allow this legal action Robinson was moved to the 758th Battalion The commander there quickly allowed Robinson to be charged with several offenses including among other charges public drunkenness even though Robinson did not drink

By the time of the court martial in August 1944 the charges against Robinson had been reduced to two counts of insubordination during questioning Robinson was acquitted by an all white panel of nine officers Although his former unit the 761st Tank Battalion became the first black tank unit to see combat in World War II Robinsons court martial stopped him from going with them He never saw fighting action in the war After his acquittal he was moved to Camp Breckinridge Kentucky There he served as a coach for army athletics until receiving an honorable discharge in November 1944 While there Robinson met an ex player for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro American League The player encouraged Robinson to write the Monarchs and ask for a tryout Robinson took the ex players advice and wrote Monarchs co owner Thomas Baird

After he left the army Robinson returned to his old football club the Los Angeles Bulldogs for a short time Robinson then took an offer from his old friend and pastor Rev Karl Downs to be the athletic director at Sam Huston College in Austin The school was part of the Southwestern Athletic Conference at the time The job included coaching the schools basketball team for the 194445 season As a starting program few students tried out for the basketball team Robinson even had to play in some of the practice games Although his teams were outmatched by opponents Robinson was respected as a coach who made his players work really hard He received the respect of among others Langston University basketball player Marques Haynes a future member of the Harlem Globetrotters

In early 1945 while Robinson was at Sam Huston College the Kansas City Monarchs sent him a written offer to play professional baseball in the Negro leagues Robinson accepted a contract for 400 per month This was a big deal for him at the time He played well for the Monarchs but Robinson was upset with the experience He had grown used to having a structure while playing in college The Negro leagues lack of organization and acceptance of gambling interests bothered him The travel schedule also placed stress on his relationship with Isum The two could now communicate only by letter In all Robinson played 47 games at shortstop for the Monarchs He hit 387 with five home runs and had 13 stolen bases He also played in the 1945 Negro League All Star Game

During the season Robinson tried for a possible major league interest The Boston Red Sox held a tryout at Fenway Park for Robinson and other black players on April 16 1945 The tryout however was an act held mostly to make powerful Boston City Councilman Isadore Muchnick happy Even with the stands limited to management Robinson was subjected to racial comments Robinson left the tryout humiliated More than fourteen years later in July 1959 the Red Sox became the last major league team to integrate its roster

Other teams however had more serious interest in signing a black ballplayer In the mid 1940s Branch Rickey club president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers began to scout the Negro leagues for a possible addition to the Dodgers roster Rickey selected Robinson from a list of African American players He interviewed Robinson for possible assignment to Brooklyns International League farm club the Montreal Royals Rickey was especially interested in making sure his eventual hire could put up with the racial abuse that he would receive In a famous three hour discussion on August 28 1945 Rickey asked Robinson if he could face the racial hatred without reacting angrily This was a worry because of Robinsons past arguments with law enforcement officials at PJC and in the military Robinson was shocked Are you looking for a Negro who is afraid to fight back Rickey replied that he needed a Negro player with guts enough not to fight back After receiving a vow from Robinson to turn the other cheek to racial taunts Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for 600 a month

He made Robinson keep the agreement a secret for the time being Rickey committed to officially signing Robinson before November 1 1945 On October 23 it was announced that Robinson would be assigned to the Royals for the 1946 season On the same day with officials of the Royals and Dodgers present Robinson signed his contract with the Royals In what was later referred to as The Noble Experiment Robinson was the first black baseball player in the International League since the 1880s Robinson was not necessarily the best player in the Negro leagues Black players Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson were upset when Robinson was selected first

Rickeys offer allowed Robinson to leave the Monarchs and their long bus rides behind He went home to Pasadena  That September he signed with Chet Brewers Kansas City Royals This was a post season barnstorming team in the California Winter League Later that off season he toured South America with another team His fiance Isum worked as a nurse in New York City while he was away On February 10 1946 Robinson and Isum were married by their old friend Rev Karl Downs

In 1946 Robinson arrived at Daytona Beach Florida for spring training with the Montreal Royals of the Class AAA International League Robinsons being there upset people in racially sensitive Florida He was not allowed to stay with his teammates at the team hotel Instead he lived at the home of a local black politician Since the Dodgers team did not own a spring training complex the schedule was controlled by the towns in the area Some of these towns did not allow any event involving Robinson or Johnny Wright another black player whom Rickey had signed to the Dodgers in January In Sanford Florida the police chief said he would cancel games if Robinson and Wright did not stop training there Because of this Robinson was sent back to Daytona Beach In Jacksonville the stadium was locked without warning on game day This was ordered by the citys Parks and Public Property director In DeLand a day game was canceled supposedly because of bad electrical lighting 

After a lot of talking to local officials by Rickey the Royals were allowed to host a game involving Robinson in Daytona Beach Robinson made his Royals debut at Daytona Beachs City Island Ballpark on March 17 1946 It was an exhibition game against the Dodgers With the game Robinson became the first African American to openly play for a minor league team and against a major league team since the baseball color line had been put in place in the 1880s Later in spring training after some somewhat poor performances Robinson was moved from shortstop to second base This allowed him to make shorter throws to first base Robinsons performance soon improved On April 18 1946 Roosevelt Stadium hosted the Jersey City Giants season opener against the Montreal Royals This game was the furst professional game for the Royals Jackie Robinson In his five trips to the plate Robinson had four hits including a three run home run He also scored four runs drove in three and stole two bases in the Royals 141 win Robinson went on to lead the International League that season with a 349 batting average and 985 fielding percentage He was named the leagues Most Valuable Player Although he often faced hatred while on road trips the Montreal fans supported Robinson Whether fans supported or opposed it Robinsons being on the field helped attendance More than one million people went to games that Robinson played in in 1946 The number was an amazing amount for the International League In the fall of 1946 following the baseball season Robinson returned home to California and briefly played professional basketball for the Los Angeles Red Devils

The following year six days before the start of the 1947 season the Dodgers brought Robinson up to the major leagues Eddie Stanky was playing second base for the Dodgers So Robinson played his first major league season as a first baseman On April 15 1947 Robinson played his first major league game at Ebbets Field in front of a crowd of 26623 spectators More than 14000 black fans attended the game He did not get a base hit but the Dodgers won 53 Robinson became the first player since the 1880s to openly break the major league baseball color line Black fans began coming to see the Dodgers when they came to town ignoring their Negro league teams

Robinsons rise to the major leagues met a generally positive although mixed reception from newspapers and white major league players However there was racial tension in the Dodger clubhouse Some Dodger players implied they would sit out rather than play alongside Robinson The possible problem ended when Dodgers bosses defended Robinson Manager Leo Durocher told the team I do not care if the guy is yellow or black or if he has stripes like a fuckin zebra Im the manager of this team and I say he plays Whats more I say he can make us all rich And if any of you cannot use the money I will see that you are all traded

Robinson was also taunted by opposing teams Some notably the St Louis Cardinals said they would strike if Robinson played National League President Ford Frick and Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler said that any striking players would be suspended Robinson became the target of rough physical play by opponents Once he received a seven inch cut in his leg On April 22 1947 during a game between the Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies Phillies players called Robinson a nigger from their dugout They yelled that he should go back to the cotton fields Rickey later recalled that Phillies manager Ben Chapman did more than anybody to unite the Dodgers When he poured out that string of unconscionable abuse he solidified and united thirty men

Robinson received major support from several major league players Dodgers teammate Pee Wee Reese once came to Robinsons defense with the famous line You can hate a man for many reasons Color is not one of them In 1948 Reese put his arm around Robinson in response to fans who shouted racial slurs at Robinson before a game in Cincinnati A statue by artist William Behrends first displayed at KeySpan Park on November 1 2005 shows this event by representing Reese with his arm around Robinson Jewish baseball star Hank Greenberg who had to deal with racial slurs during his career also encouraged Robinson After colliding with Robinson at first base on one occasion Greenberg whispered a few words into Robinsons ear Robinson later said they were words of encouragement Greenberg had told him that the best way to go against the slurs from the opposing players was to beat them on the field

Robinson finished the season with 12 home runs a league leading 29 steals a 297 batting average a 427 slugging percentage and 125 runs scored His performance earned him the first Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award

After Stanky was traded to the Boston Braves in March 1948 Robinson took over second base There he had a 980 fielding percentage for year Robinson had a batting average of 296 and 22 stolen bases for the season In a 127 win against the St Louis Cardinals on August 29 by1948 he hit for the cycle a home run a triple a double and a single in the same game The Dodgers moved into first place in the National League in late August 1948 for a short time but they finished third at the end of the season The Braves went on to win the league title and lose to the Cleveland Indians in the World Series

Racial pressure on Robinson eased in 1948 as a number of other black players entered the major leagues Larry Doby and Satchel Paige played for the Cleveland Indians The Dodgers had three other black players besides Robinson In February 1948 he signed a 12500 contract with the Dodgers While a big amount this was less than Robinson made in the off season He had a vaudeville tour where he answered pre set baseball questions and a speaking tour of the South Between the tours he had surgery on his right ankle Because of his off season events Robinson went to training camp thirty pounds overweight He lost the weight during training camp but dieting left him weak while hitting

In the spring of 1949 Robinson turned to Hall of Famer George Sisler working as an advisor to the Dodgers for batting help On Sislers advice Robinson spent hours at a batting tee learning to hit the ball to right field Sisler taught Robinson to look for a fastball His theory was that it is easier to then adjust to a slower curveball Robinson also noted that Sisler showed me how to stop lunging how to check my swing until the last fraction of a second The teaching helped Robinson raise his batting average from 296 in 1948 to 342 in 1949 In addition to his improved batting average Robinson stole 37 bases that season was second place in the league for both doubles and triples and had 124 runs batted in with 122 runs scored For the performance Robinson earned the Most Valuable Player award for the National League Baseball fans also voted Robinson as the starting second baseman for the 1949 All Star Game This was the first All Star Game to include black players

Long before the fish lived in the seas and the Dinosaurs roamed the land Trilobites appeared some 600 million years ago during the Cambrian period They belonged to the phylum Arthropoda a phylum which to this day represents the most successful of all animal life forms including crabs centipedes spiders shrimps and insects The Trilobites living in shallow seas flourished as swimmers crawlers and burrowers for some 350 million years They evolved rapidly into many strange and beautiful forms

First capturing mans eye some 25000 years ago in France where two specimens were found is association with a Cro magnon settlement at a site called La Grotte du Trilobite one was found with a hole drilled into it and worn as an adornment Others have been found in the tombs of Egypt Greece and Rome Trilobite fossils were sold on the street of 15th Century Europe and collected by Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin today they are collected studied and enjoyed by people from all walks of life

Trilobites appear to have been only marine dwelling creatures because their remains are always found in rocks that contain other marine life forms However within their marine environment trilobites were found in many different conditions from extremely shallow to very deep water They lived in almost every ancient ocean and their fossils are found on every continent

The province was created on 1885 It was part of the La Vega province until it was made a province

Espaillat is bordered to the east by the province of Hermanas Mirabal to the south by La Vega to the west by the Santiago and Puerto Plata provinces The Mara Trinidad Snchez province is to the northwest of the Espaillat province and the Atlantic Ocean is to the north

The province was named after Ulises Francisco Espaillat who was President of the Dominican Republic for a short period of time

The Espaillat province has had many changes in its area Before 1885 when the province was made the southern part of the present province was part of La Vega province and the northern part was of the Puerto Plata province

When the province was made in 1885 it had the land of the present provinces of Hermanas Mirabal Duarte and Mara Trinidad Snchez provinces and the southern part of the present Espaillat province But when the Duarte province was made in 1896 the Espaillat province lost most of the land east of the Hermanas Mirabal province in 1945 the land north of the Cordillera Septentrional was added to the Espaillat province

In 1952 the Hermanas Mirabal province was made and the Espaillat province kept the land that it has now with some parts to the south of the Cordillera Septentrional and other parts to the north of it

Three main roads go through this province One goes along the Atlantic coastit goes from Puerto Plata to Saman

A second road comes from the south from La Vega province and when it gets to Moca turns to the west to Santiago de los Caballeros This is the old Carretera Duarte but from Concepcin de la Vega to Santiago de los Caballeros the Duarte Highway is used by most people without going through Moca

The third road begins in Moca and goes to the provinces to the east

The Cordillera Septentrional is in the north central part of the province but the mountains here are not very high The highest mountain in the province is the El Mogote at 970 metres above sea level

There are only short rivers in the province The most important river that flows into the Atlantic Ocean and the longest of the province is the Ysica river it forms the limit with the Puerto Plata province Other important rivers that flow to the north are the Jamao and Veragua rivers which are tributaries of the Ysica river

In the southern part of the province the rivers are very short and most of them are tributaries of the Licey river Besides the Licey river other rivers are Moca and Bacu

The climate of the province is a tropical climate hot most of the year but it is cooler on the mountains

There are four municipalities and eleven municipal districts in the province Municipal districts are similar to municipalities but they depend on a municipality

Ammonites were marine cephalopod molluscs of the subclass Ammonoidea 

Their widely known fossils show a ribbed spiral form shell in the end compartment of which lived the tentacled animal These creatures lived in the seas from at least 400 to 65 million years ago They became extinct at the KT extinction event Their nearest living relatives are the octopus squid cuttlefish and Nautilus

Nine orders are recognised in the Ammonoidea five in the Palaeozoic and four in the Mesozoic

Ammonites first appeared in the early Devonian period They evolved from a small straight shelled Bactridian which was an early Nautiloid They quickly evolved into a variety of shapes and sizes including some shaped like hairpins During their evolution the ammonites faced no fewer than four catastrophic events that would eventually lead to their extinction The first event occurred in the Upper Devonian and the second at the end of the Permian when only two lines survived the PTr extinction event The surviving species radiated and flourished throughout the Triassic perod At the end of this period they faced near extinction again when only one genus survived This event marked the end of the Triassic and the beginning of the Jurassic during which time the number of ammonite species grew once more The final catastrophe occurred at the end of the Cretaceous period when all species were annihilated and the ammonites became extinct

The young ammonites lived in the plankton near the sea surface They ate mostly small fry as they were growing This made them especially vulnerable to any event which upset the plankton zone

Ammonites began life as tiny planktonic creatures less than 1mm in diameter In their infancy they would have been vulnerable to attack from other predators including mosasaurs and fish However their shell gave their soft parts some protection The existence of sexual dimorphism with larger females and smaller males has been much discussedp244 The matter is still open but at least in some species deposits are found with two sizes and no intermediates

As the shell grew the back compartments were sealed with a semi permeable membrane A single tube the siphuncle passed through the centre of each septum and connected the chambers The animal could add or withdraw gas as it needed for buoyancy On the inside of the shell the compartments are marked by elaborate sutures These can be seen easily on those fossils which are internal moulds as most arep241 Ammonites were active predators and they themselves were often eaten by fish and marine reptiles The fossils are almost always found with the outer compartment broken off probably as a result of just such an attack

Ammonoid shells are always thinner than the shells of Nautilus and their siphuncles were usually ventral They swam by jet propulsion as do most other cepalopods Water would have come into the mantle cavity passed over the gills and was squirted out Nautilus also has an escape mechanism where a contraction of the branchial chamber causes the animal to jump out of the way of a predatorp232 It would be reasonable to suppose that ammonites had a similar mechanism

A drop is a small bit of liquid such as water which is held together by surface tension It is normally thought of as falling Something that is dropping can sometimes be called broken wikt linkdrippingdripping Drops are often circular in shape and sometimes when light is refracted through them it makes a rainbow effect Rain is an example of when drops fall Drops are also like bubbles except they hold liquid instead of a gas like air

William McGonagall was a Scottish poet He thought he was good at writing poetry but his poetry was often considered to be the worst poetry in the English language He became famous because he was such a bad poet 

William McGonagall was born in Edinburgh Scotland His family were originally Irish McGonagall worked as a weaver in Dundee

In 1877 when he was probably 52 years old he suddenly found that he liked writing poetry He wrote a poem about a local vicar and sent it to the Dundee Weekly News The editor thought it was a joke and he published it as a jokey poem

McGonagall continued to write poetry He read his poems in public and lots of people came to hear him However his audience had really come to laugh at him and throw rotten vegetables at him

Mc Gonagalls poems have stupid rhymes the words he uses are often silly and he mixes his imagery in clumsy ways One of his most famous poems is about the Tay Bridge Disaster It tells of a real event in 1879 when the bridge over the river Tay in Scotland collapsed and a train that was going over the bridge crashed killing many people Part of McGonagalls poem goes 

McGonagall did not seem to realise that people thought his poems were bad He became disappointed that the town of Dundee did not recognize him as a great poet so he went to Perth and then to Edinburgh He continued to write poetry He travelled to London because he had been given an invitation to meet the famous actor Sir Henry Irvine However someone had been playing a trick on him the invitation was not a real one and he was not let into the theatre

McGonagall wrote some poetry about London while he was there He wrote 

McGonagall was teetotal and often spoke against drinking alcohol He thought that his audiences did not like his poetry because they had been drinking too much

When he died in 1902 he was a very poor man

People still remember McGonagalls poems today and continue to make fun of them The comedian Spike Milligan had a character called McGoonagall in The Goon Show One episode of The Muppet Show had a character called Angus McGonagle In the Harry Potter books author JK Rowling chose the surname of the Professor of Transfiguration Minerva McGonagall because she had heard of McGonagall and loved the name

There is a McGonagall Appreciation Society in McGonagalls home town of Dundee

Jefferson County is a county in the US state of Alabama 

The county was named after Thomas Jefferson the third President of the United States The county has the largest population of all other counties in Alabama and was 662047 as of the 2000 US census The largest city in Jefferson County is Birmingham Alabama

Jefferson County was created by the Alabama legislature on December 13 1819 42 year before the American Civil War

Jefferson County was spending more than its total revenue so it sold bonds to finance its operating deficits Normally governments sell bonds to borrow money to build infrastructure But Jefferson County borrowed money to put off tax increases or service reductions Jefferson County worked with Wall Street banks to sell the bonds and to make interest rate swaps on its debt These financial deals happened in 2002 and 2003 while the economy was healthy People who purchase bonds want to know the source of the money to pay back the bonds So Jefferson County used its sewer system fees to back its bonds The county sold 314 billion in sewer bonds It also paid the banks millions of dollars of fees for their help in selling the bonds and setting up the countys debt

By 2011 Jefferson County could no longer borrow additional money and its total revenues fell because of the bad economy So the county went to the Wall Street and asked them to forgive 1 billion of the debt After months of talking the county and the banks were 130 million apart from a final agreement The banks wanted the county to raise sewer rates to cover the missing money The county wanted the banks to forgive more debt

On November 9 2011 the county gave up and filed for bankruptcy Jefferson County became the subject of the most expensive municipal bankruptcy ever in the United States at 41 billion with debts of 314 billion relating to sewer work This means that a court will unravel what the county owes Under bankruptcy people who loaned money to the county will not get all of their money back

Apple adopted Intel processors which post 2006 Apple Computers now run on Because Mac OS X was written for Power PC MAC OS X ran in a emulation environment called ROSETTA Programs and applications received Universal Binary updates to make them run reliably and use less resources of the Rosetta environment instead hardware accelerating themselves 

iMac Models after 2001 were shipped with Mac OS X

The Latest Mac OS X incarnation Snow Leopard is Intel Processor dependent No PowerPC based computer can run or install it meaning most of the iMac line are not 106 compatible Furthermore only four types of the iMac G4 models meet the 105 Leopard minimum specifications With the exception of the 233mhz and 333mhz tray loaders as well as the iMac 350 MHz all iMac G3 and G4 can run Mac OS X the latest version for them being 10411

Craigslist is a centralized network of online communities for free classified advertisements and forums on various topics

The service was founded in 1995 by Craig Newmark for the San Francisco Bay Area After incorporation as a private for profit company in 1999 Craigslist expanded into nine more US cities in 2000 four each in 2001 and 2002 and 14 in 2003 By September 2007 Craigslist had established itself in approximately 450 cities in 50 countries

In 2007 Craigslist operated with a staff of 24 people Its sole source of revenue is paid job ads in select cities and paid broker apartment listings in New York City

The site serves over nine billion page views per month putting it in 56th place overall among web sites world wide ninth place overall among web sites in the United States to over thirty million unique visitors With over thirty million new classified advertisements each month Craigslist is the leading classifieds service in any medium The site receives over two million new job listings each month So it is one of the top job boards in the world

In 2001 the company started the Craigslist Foundation a 501 nonprofit organization that helps emerging nonprofit organizations get established gain visibility attract the attention of potential donors and develop the skills and knowledge required for long term success

It accepts charitable donations and rather than directly funding organizations it produces face to face events and offers online resources to help grassroots organizations get off the ground and contribute real value to the community

The first 14 city sites were

Vancouver British Columbia was the first non US city included London was the first city outside North America

In November 2004 Amsterdam Bangalore Paris Sao Paulo and Tokyo became the first cities outside of primarily English speaking countries

In May 2008 500 cities in 50 countries are represented

Classified advertising is a form of advertising which is particularly common in newspapers online and other periodicals eg free ads papers or Pennysavers Classified advertising allows private individuals to solicit sales for products and services 

Classified advertising is called such because it is generally grouped within the publication under headings classifying the product or service being offered and is grouped entirely in a distinct section of the periodical which makes it distinct from display advertising which often contains graphics or other art work and which is placed near to editorial content 

Newspapers have continued their downward trend in classifieds revenue as internet classifieds grow Classified advertising at some of the larger newspaper chains has dropped 14 to 20 in 2007 while traffic to classified sites has grown 23

As the online classified advertising sector develops there is an increasing emphasis toward specialization 

Inti Cusi Huallpa Huscar was emperor of the Inca empire from 1527 to 1532 AD He succeeded his father Huayna Capac and brother Ninan Cuyochi Both of whom died of smallpox while they fought near Quito 

On the death of their father and their older brother the empire was divided between the two surviving brothers Huscar and Atahualpa Huascar got the major part of it with the capital Cusco and Atahualpa the northern parts including Quito For a couple of years the two brothers reigned without problems But Huascar demanded that Atahuallpa swear an oath to him Atahuallpa refused and the civil war began Atahualpas commander lead armies of 100000 men About 60000 men supported Huscar This demonstrates the numerical potential of Incan armies The war was uncompleted but Atahualpa had a clear advantage when Francisco Pizarro arrived But it was partly due to this civil war that Francisco Pizarro was successful

The CLAAS Jaguar is a silage harvester made by CLAAS It has a DaimlerChrysler engine

The CLAAS Jaguar was first built in 1973 when the idea of silage was fairly new Claas already made combines and balers The first CLAAS Jaguar was a small green machine The 10000th Jaguar was sold in 1994 the 15000th unveiled in 1998 and the 20000th sold in 2004

The CLAAS Jaguar is one of the best selling silage harvesters ever made They sell especially well in European countries Of the forage harvesters CLAAS sold in Ireland from 2000 to 2003 60 were Claas Jaguars 

 Model Range  The model range has not changed much over the past eight years except for 2003 and 2007 In Europe the current models are the 830 850 870 890 and the largest one the 900 In North America the models are 950 960 970 and 980 

 Speedstar Green Eye  Before 2003 most forage harvesters operated at very slow speeds In 2003 new technology meant that a new silage harvester with the same look as the old model would be built In Autumn of that year the CLAAS Jaguar Speedstar was first sold 

The Green Eye is a new addition After four years of scientific experiments the Green Eye was made in May 2007 The 900 model now being sold in Europe is known as the CLAAS Jaguar 900 Green Eye The Green Eye is also available in the other models as well

Pecorino cheese is the name for a few kinds of Italian cheeses made of sheep milk The word pecora from which the name derives means sheep Most of these cheeses are aged for some time They taste rather salty 

Pecorino Romano is probably the best known outside Italy especially in the United States The cheese has been exported to the United States since the 19th century Most Pecorino Romano is produced on the island of Sardinia though its production is also allowed in Lazio and in the Tuscan Province of Grosseto 

Pecorino Sardo also comes from Sardinia It is milder Pecorino Toscano is from Tuscany and Pecorino Siciliano from Sicily All come in a variety of styles depending on how long they have been matured The more matured cheeses referred to as stagionato are harder and have a stronger flavour Sometimes the cheeses are made with spices In Sardinia the larvae of the cheese fly are intentionally introduced into Pecorino Sardo to produce a local delicacy called casu marzu

Pecorino Romano is most often used on pasta dishes like the better known Parmigiano Reggiano Its distinctive strong very salty flavour means that it is preferred for some pasta dishes with highly flavoured sauces especially those of Roman origin such as pasta allamatriciana

Ichthyosaurs are an extinct order of marine reptiles from the Mesozoic era 

They are similar in shape to dolphins and to fast predatory fish like tuna They are found in marine strata from the earliest Triassic to the Cretaceous with essentially the same body shape 

Although isolated ichthyosaur vertebrae are quite common the first fossil which showed the ichthyosaur form was found by Mary Anning and her brother Joseph Mary Anning was an early British fossil collector dealer and paleontologist Many of her finds may be seen today at the Natural History Museum London

Mary Annings first great discovery was made shortly after her fathers death when she was just twelve In 1810 her bother Joseph found what he thought was a crocodile skull but the rest of the animal was not in evidence Mary kept searching and a year later a storm weathered away part of the cliff and exposed part of the rest of the skeleton of the 17ft long creature which she was able to dig out of the cliff and collect with a little help from local quarrymenp3341 Anning later discovered three more species

In 1821 William Conybeare and Marys old friend Henry De la Beche published a paper which analyzed the specimens found by Mary and others They concluded that ichthyosaurs were a previously unknown kind of marine reptile and they decided there had been at least three species 

They have no neck streamlined form paddles and fish like tail Ichthyosaurs averaged about 24m in length a few were smaller and some species grew much larger They had a porpoise like head and a long toothed snout Built for speed like modern tuna some ichthyosaurs appear also to have been deep divers like some modern whales It has been estimated that ichthyosaurs could swim at speeds up to convert40kmhmph Similar to modern cetaceans such as whales and dolphins they were air breathing

According to weight estimates by Ryosuke Motani a m to ft24 Stenopterygius weighed around convert163 168kglb whilst a m to ft4 Ophthalmosaurus icenicus weighed 930950kg

Biologist Stephen Jay Gould said the ichthyosaur was his favorite example of convergent evolution Its similarities to fish are not homologous caused by common descent but analogous caused by selection in the same environment

This sea going reptile with terrestrial ancestors converged so strongly on fishes that it actually evolved a dorsal fin and tail in just the right place and with just the right hydrological design These structures are all the more remarkable because they evolved from nothing the ancestral terrestrial reptile had no hump on its back or blade on its tail to serve as a precursor

The eyes of ichthyosaurs are large in comparison to the size of the body suggesting they hunted by sight even in dimly lit waters or at night In fact ichthyosaurs hold the record for eye size the largest was 264mm in diameter from the species Temnodontosaurus platyodon This is the largest eye ever recorded for any vertebrate the colossal squid eye is larger still The eyes of ichthyosaurs are protected by sclerotic rings These are circlar bony plates inside the outer edges of the cornea of the eye Their function is mechanical support of the eye They are well preserved in fossil ichthyosaur skulls

At first the downward pointing tail bones were hard to interpret Then later in the 19th century a remarkable find was made Some specimens of Mixosaurus and Stenopterygius were well preserved in the black mudstones of Germany These fossils were preserved in such fine sediment that the fossils were almost perfect with only a few bones disturbed or missing The outline of the body shape could be seen as a thin carbon filmp10 Even though the soft parts had rotted away long ago they left their imprint behind For the first time scientists could see clearly that the tail of ichthyosaurus was shaped like the tail of a fish And on its back like a shark there was a dorsal fin 

Live birth was always assumed for ichthyosaurs because with their paddles they could never have manoeuvred on land to lay eggs like turtles do Evidence came again from the early Jurassic of Germany where several fine examples clearly show embryos inside the rib cage of the adult Other examples exist of the young actually being bornp125 They came out tail first No doubt some complication of birth had killed both mother and offspring

Ichthyosaurs became extinct during the Upper Cretaceous about 30 million years before the KT extinction event There was an ocean anoxic event at the CenomanianTuronian stage boundary The deeper layers of the seas became anoxic and poisoned by hydrogen sulphide As life died off in the lower levels of the sea so did the predators at the top of the food chain The last pliosaurs and ichthyosaurs became extinctp251 

Ichthyosaurs had been dwindling in numbers for some time they were no longer the force they once were in the Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic By the middle Jurassic all belonged to the single clade Ophthalmosauria By the Cretaceous only three genera survived Only one genus Platypterygius is known at the time of the anoxic event in the Upper Cretaceous 

No firm reasons can be given for the decline of the ichthyosaurs By the Cretaceous they certainly had more competitors than in the Triassic and more elusive prey The adaptive radiation of teleost fish meant their new prey were fast swimming and highly evasive The teleosts also included fast swimming predatory fish which must have been competitors This together with the extinction event was apparently enough to end their long history

The ichthyosaurs and pliosaurs were replaced in the marine ecology by the giant mosasaurs The mosasaurs were probably ambush hunters whose sit and wait strategy apparently proved most successful

Ichthyosaurus was an extinct marine reptile from the Lower Jurassic It was the first member of the order Ichthyosauria to be discovered The first complete skeleton was discovered in the early 19th century by Mary Anning in the Dorset Jurassic Coast Many more specimens were found in Europe especially from the limestone quarries in Holzmaden southern Germany

Ichthyosaurus lived from about 199 to 189 million years ago This sleek animal could perhaps swim at speeds up to 25 mph 

Ichthyosaurus bore live young This we know from fossil evidence It was initially believed that Ichthyosaurus laid eggs on land but fossil evidence shows that in fact the females gave birth to live young As such they were well adapted to life as fully pelagic organisms The babies were born tail first to prevent them from drowning in the water

Hundreds of well preserved fossilised skeletons have been found in Jurassic rock at Holzmaden Some of the bones were still articulated Some fossils still had baby specimens inside them indicating that Ichthyosaurus was viviparous Similar finds in the related Stenopterygius also show this 

The German fossils also featured the outline of Ichthyosauruss skin revealing that it had a fleshy dorsal fin on its back and a large caudal fin Other ichthyosaur fossils showed this feature was not limited to Ichthyosaurus

Ichthyosaurus ear bones were solid probably transferring water vibrations to the inner ear Still hunting by sight was the creatures main feeding activity it had huge sensitive eyes protected by bony shields 

Coprolites of Ichthyosaurus show its diet consisted of fish and squid

Stenopterygius was a typical dolphin shaped ichthyosaur of the early Jurassic period Its similar to the poster reptile of the ichthyosaur family Ichthyosaurus but with slightly narrower flippers and a smaller head

Like fish like Stenopterygius was more streamlined than earlier ichthyosaurs of the Triassic period and likely swam much faster in pursuit of prey

Some Stenopterygius fossils have been found with the remains of juveniles inside clearly instances of mothers dying before they could give birth As with other ichthyosaurs its now believed that Stenopterygius females gave birth to live young rather than laying eggs like other reptiles

Temnodontosaurus was an ichthyosaur from the early Jurassic some 196 and 190 million years ago found in Europe which grew to about 9 meters in length Sometimes known as Leptopterygius this huge ichthyosaur cruised the shallow seas hunting large squid and ammonites 

Californosaurus was an ichthyosaur an extinct marine reptile It was 10 feet long It had four paddle shaped flippers and sharp teeth in long pointed jaws 

Californosaurus lived during the late Triassic period in seas that covered what is now California It fed on fish and other small marine creatures Like other ichthyosaurs it probably never came onto dry land and gave birth in the water

Cymbospondylus was a large but very primitive Triassic ichthyosaur with a long eel like body up to 10 meters or more in length

Cymbospondylus is known from both Germany and Nevada and there is no doubt that like other large marine reptiles and mammals this animal had a cosmopolitan pan oceanic distribution

Although traditionally included under the Shastasaurid Cymbospondylus seems to have been more primitive than other members of the family and probably represents an early but successful offshoot of ichthyosaur evolution 

Mixosaurus was a small common and cosmopolitan Triassic ichthyosaur It was only about a meter in length Fossils are known from Alaska Canada China Timor Indonesia Italy Nevada New Zealand Spitsbergen and Svalbard Thus it lived in the Tethys Sea but also ventured farther afield

Mixosaurus seems to have been a transitional form between the more primitive eel shaped icthyosaurs such as Cymbospondylus and the more advanced Shatsasaurs and Euichthyosaurs

Ophthalmosaurus was an ichthyosaur of the Upper Jurassic period named after its large eyes Well preserved skeletons ranging in age from juveniles to adults have been found in Europe North America and Argentina

Ophthalmosaurus had the largest eyes of any vertebrate relative to its body size Its eyes 4 inches in diameter occupied most of the space in the skull They were protected by bony plates which most likely assisted to maintain the shape of the eyeballs against water pressure at depth The size of the eyes and the sclerotic rings suggests that Ophthalmosaurus hunted at a depth where there is not much light or that it may have hunted at night when a prey species was more active Its snout was long and thin perfect for snapping at fast manoeuverable prey

Calculations suggest that a typical Ophthalmosaurus could stay submerged for approximately 20 minutes or more The swimming speed of Ophthalmosaurus has been estimated at 25 metres per second or greater Even assuming a conservative speed of 1 ms an Ophthalmosaurus would be able to dive to 600 meters and return to the surface within 20 minutes

The family Ophthalmosauridae continued into the Upper Cretaceous but this genus became extinct at the end of the Jurassic period

Philip Carteret was an English officer in the Royal Navy He sailed as a lieutenant on John Byrons circumnavigation of the world in 1764 He went around the world again as part of the Royal Navys exploration in 1766 

Carteret joined the Royal Navy in 1747 at the age of 14 He first served on the Salisbury He sailed with John Byron from 1751 to 1755 As Lieutenant on HMS Doplhin he went with Byron on the round world trip from 17641766

As soon as he had returned from his first trip Carteret was put in charge of HMS Swallow to go on a second circumnavigation with Samuel Wallis who sailed in the HMS Dolphin The two ships were separated sailing around Cape Horn so Carteret continued on alone He discovered Pitcairn Island on 2 July 1767 He did not land on the island He also discovered the Carteret Islands Mururoa and the Duke of Gloucester Islands He got back to England in 1769 The Swallow was in bad condition and the success of the long trip shows Carterets courage and skill

Carterets health was ruined by his voyage of exploration He was put on half pay and in 1773 he wrote the story of the voyage as part of a book about the voyages of Byron Wallis Carteret and Cook The books editor John Hawkesworth made changes to the story so Carteret wrote his own book which was not printed until 1965 In 1779 he took the ship HMS Endymion to the West Indies This was his last trip He was promoted to Vice Admiral and he retired to Southhampton in 1794 His personal papers are kept in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich England

Leptictidium was a genus of small prehistoric eutherian from Eocene period this extinct species of mammal lived alongside the dinosaurs but died out when the tropical forests opened up 

Leptictidium had long hind legs and probably used only those two legs when moving fast Whether it hopped on two legs or ran bipedally is still a matter of debate It had a long bare tail which acted as a counterbalance and a long mobile snout to help it find its prey

The leptictids were found right across Eurasia Leptictidium itself was a specialised hopper with the best preserved specimens found in the Messel shales of Germany

It is known that there were settlements in the Attica region since prehistoric times It is unknown however when exactly one of them was first called Athens According to Plato when Solon visited Egypt some priests told him that according to their archives there was a city called Athens at least from 9600 BC There is no evidence to support this 

According to Greek mythology the name Athens have given in the time of its first king Cecrops about 2000 BC

Later the myth of Theseas shows that the city was a vassal of Minoic Crete until an expedition that overthrown that status quo

According to Homers Iliad Athens took the side of Mykenae in the Troic War senting 50 ships under the command of its king Menestheas That shows that it was already a relatively major city of Greece since a few other cities sent more

The Viceroyalty of Peru was a Spanish colonial administrative district that was created in 1542 and originally contained most of Spanish ruled South America It was governed from the capital of Lima 

In 1542 the Spanish created the Viceroyalty of New Castilla that shortly afterwards would be called the Viceroyalty of Peru In 1544 Holy Roman Emperor Charles V named Blasco Nez Vela Perus first viceroy but the viceroyalty was not organized until the arrival of Viceroy Francisco de Toledo in 1572 

Francisco de Toledo one of the great administrators of human times established the Inquisition and created laws that applied to both Indians and Spanish alike So he broke the power of the encomenderos and reduced the old system of forced native labor He improved the safety in the viceroyalty with fortifications bridges and la Armada del Mar del Sur against the pirates 

The Amazon basin and some large regions nearby had been considered Spanish territory since the Treaty of Tordesillas But this treaty meant not much during the time Spain controlled Portugal 

The first Jesuit reduction to convert and civilize the Indigenous population was founded in 1609 but some areas were occupied by Brazilians as Bandeirantes gradually extended their activities throughout much of the basin and adjoining Matto Grosso in the 17th and 18th centuries These groups had the advantage of remote geography and river access from the mouth of the Amazon making it impossible for the Spanish authorities to control them One famous attack upon a Spanish mission in 1628 resulted in the enslavement of 60 000 indigenous people In fact as time passed they were used as a self funding occupation force by the Portuguese authorities in what was effectively a low level war of territorial conquest Finally the reality of the situation was recognized with the transfer of sovereignty over the much of the basin and surrounding areas to Portugal in the Treaty of Madrid 

Vilcabamba was founded by Manco Inca in 1539 and was the last city of the Inca Empire until it fell to the Spaniards in 1572 That meant the end of Inca resistance to Spanish rule 

After the Incan empire fell the city was burned and the area swiftly became a remote not very populated or connected part of Peru The location of Vilcabamba was forgotten

The ruins of the city were rediscovered by Hiram Bingham in 1909 in a remote forest site 130 km west of Cuzco but he failed to realize its significance because he believed that Machu Picchu which he also rediscovered was the fabled Lost City of the Incas It was not until explorations and discoveries in the 1960s that many came to see this site at Espritu Pampa as the real Vilcabamba of legend

Vere Gordon Childe was an Australian archaeologist He was best known for his excavation of the unique Neolithic site of Skara Brae in Orkney He is also credited with coining the terms Neolithic Revolution and Urban Revolution He attempted to place his discoveries inside a theory of prehistoric development on a wider European and world scale

A hominid is any member of the biological family Hominidae That includes the extinct and currently existent humans chimpanzees gorillas and orangutans This classification has been revised several times in the last few decades These various revisions have led to a varied use of the word hominid the original meaning of Hominidae referred only to the modern meaning of Hominina that means only humans and their closest relatives The meaning of this taxon changed The modern meaning of hominid includes all great apes

The primatological term hominid is easily confused with a number of very similar words

Certain morphological characteristics are still used conventionally to support the idea that hominid should only mean humans and human ancestors namely bipedalism and large brains These points of departure between human beings and the other great apes are important but according to genetically based taxonomic classification are not enough to divide us into separate families Genetics rather than morphology is more widely accepted as the critical standard Many scientists including anthropologists use the term to mean humans and their direct and near direct bipedal ancestors

Miaphysitism is an idea about the nature of Christ The idea says that Jesus Christ had two different aspects one godly and one human It says these two aspects are united in one nature They are indistinguishable and they co exist This is very close to the idea of dualism which says that the mind and the body are separate things that combine to make one unit the person In the case of miaphysitism the separate things are Jesus divine and human traits 

Miaphysitism has often been considered by Chalcedonian Christians to be a form of monophysitism but the Oriental Orthodox Churches themselves reject this characterization Recently the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches have begun to take this position more seriously

Monophysitism is an idea about the nature of Jesus Christ It says that Christ only has one nature namely the divine one

There are two main doctrines that can be called Monophysite

Eutychianism says that the human and divine natures of Christ were combined into one new single nature his human nature was dissolved like a drop of honey in the sea

Apollinarism or Apollinarianism says that Christ had a human body and human living principle but that the Divine Logos had taken the place of the nous or thinking principle This is analogous but not identical to what might be called a mind in the present day

After Nestorianism taught by Nestorius Archbishop of Constantinople was refused at the First Council of Ephesus Eutyches an archimandrite at Constantinople came up with new views Monophysitism and Eutyches were also refused at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 

Monophysitism is also rejected by the Oriental Orthodox Churches but was widely accepted in Syria the Levant and Egypt This caused many tensions in the early days of the Byzantine Empire

Later Monothelitism was developed as an attempt to bridge the gap between the Monophysite and the Chalcedonian position but it too was rejected by the members of the Chalcedonian synod despite at times having the support of the Byzantine emperors and one of the Popes of Rome Honorius I Some are of the opinion that Monothelitism was at one time held by the Maronites but the Maronite community for the most part dispute this stating that they have never been out of communion with the Catholic Church

Miaphysitism the christology of the Oriental Orthodox churches is sometimes considered a variant of Monophysitism but these churches view their theology as distinct from Monophysitism and anathematize Eutyches

Christology is a field of study of Christian theology It asks questions about the nature of Christ In particular it looks at how the divine and the human relate to each other

Nestorius was Archbishop of Constantinople from 10 April 428 to 22 June 431 His views were popular in the East

He was blamed by his political enemy Cyril of Alexandria of Nestorianism for objecting to the popular practice of calling the Virgin Mary the Mother of God theotokos He was condemned at the Council of Ephesus before his supporters could arrive and he was then dethroned The consequence of this was the creation of the Assyrian Church of the East over the Persian border and far away from Greece

The Night of the Long Knives or Operation Hummingbird was a purge that took place in Nazi Germany between June 30 and July 2 1934 when the Nazi regime executed at least 90 people for political reasons Most of those killed were members of the Storm Troopers

The Perito Moreno Glacier is a glacier in the south west of Santa Cruz province Argentina It is one of the most important tourist attractions in the Argentine Patagonia

The 250 kmsup2 ice formation of 30 km in length is one of 48 glaciers fed by the Southern Patagonian Ice Field located in the Andes system shared with Chile This icefield is the worlds third largest reserve of fresh water

The Perito Moreno Glacier is one of only three Patagonian glaciers that are not retreating Periodically the glacier advances over the L shaped Lago Argentino when it reaches the opposite shore it forms a natural dam which separates the two halves of the lake With no escape route the water level on the Brazo Rico side of the lake can rise by up to 30 meters above the level of the main lake The enormous pressure produced by this mass of waters finally breaks the ice barrier holding it back in a spectacular rupture event This damrupture cycle is not regular and it naturally recurs at any frequency between once a year to less than once a decade

The Perito Moreno glacier located 78 km from El Calafate was named after the explorer Francisco Moreno a pioneer who studied the region in the 19th century and played a major role in defending the territory of Argentina in the conflict surrounding the international border dispute with Chile

Georges Vzina the youngest of eight children was born on January 21 1887 in Chicoutimi Quebec to Jacques Vzina a local baker and an immigrant from St Nicolas de La Rochelle in France and his wife Clara Vzina attended school at the Petit Sminaire de Chicoutimi until the age of fourteen when he left the school to help at his fathers bakery He played hockey from a young age participating in informal street hockey matches with others his own age Vzina played in these matches in his shoes and used skates for the first time at age sixteen when he joined the local team in Chicoutimi As Chicoutimi was in a remote area of Quebec more than 200 kilometres from Quebec City the hockey club was not in any organised league Instead or scheduled games the club known as the Saguenens toured the province playing informal games against different clubs

Vzina married Marie Adlade Stella Morin on June 3 1908 in Chicoutimi After Vzinas death it was reported that he had twenty two children This rumour was started when the Canadiens manager Leo Dandurand told newspapers that Vzina speaks no English and has twenty two children including three sets of triplets and they were all born in the space of nine years The Vzinas actually only had two children and Georges spoke some English In 1912 they had their first child a son named Jean Jules A second son was born the night of the Montreal Canadiens first Stanley Cup win in 1916 To honour the event Georges named the child Marcel Stanley When not playing hockey Vzina operated a tannery in Chicoutimi living a quiet life

On February 17 1910 the Chicoutimi Hockey Club played an informal game against the Montreal Canadiens a professional team in the National Hockey Association Though playing an weaker team the Canadiens did not score a goal losing the game This prompted Joseph Cattarinich goaltender for the Canadiens to convince his team to offer a tryout to Georges Vzina who was Chicoutimis goaltender Vzina at first refused the offer staying in Chicoutimi until the Canadiens later returned in December of that year This time they convinced Georges along with his brother Pierre to come to Montreal The two Vzina brothers arrived on December 22 1910 While Pierre failed to make the team Georges impressed the Canadiens especially with the use of his stick to block shots Vzina was signed to a contract for C800 per season and made his professional debut December 31 1910 against the Ottawa Senators He would play all sixteen games for the Canadiens in the 191011 season finishing with eight wins and eight losses while giving up the fewest goals in the league

The NHA was replaced by the National Hockey League in November 1917 with Vzina and the Canadiens joining the new league On February 18 1918 he became the first goaltender in NHL history to record a shutout by defeating the Torontos 90 On December 28 1918 he became the first goaltender to have an assist on a goal by Newsy Lalonde who had took the puck after a save by Vzina He finished the season with twelve wins allowing the fewest goals against Vzina also set a record which was shared with Clint Benedict of the Ottawa Senators for the fewest shutouts needed to lead the league in that category with one

Returning to Montreal for training camp for the 192526 season Vzina was noticeably sick though he said nothing about it By the time of the Canadiens first game on November 28 against the Pittsburgh Pirates he had lost 35 pounds in a span of six weeks and had a fever of 102 Fahrenheit Even so he took to the ice and completed the first period without allowing a goal Vzina began vomiting blood in the intermission before returning for the start of the second period He then collapsed in his goal area and left the game with former US Olympic team goaltender Alphonse Lacroix taking his place

The day after the game Vzina was diagnosed with tuberculosis and advised to return home He made a last trip into the Canadiens dressing room on December 3 to say a final goodbye to his teammates Dandurand would later describe Vzina as sitting in his corner of the dressing room with tears rolling down his cheeks He was looking at his old pads and skates that Eddie Dufour the Canadiens trainer had arranged in Georgess corner Then he asked one little favourthe sweater he had worn in the last world series Vzina returned to his hometown of Chicoutimi with his wife Marie where he died in the early hours on March 27 1926 at lHtel Dieu Though he played only one period for the Canadiens during the entire season the team paid his entire 6000 salary showing how important Vzina had been to the team

One of the best goaltenders in the NHA and early NHL Vzina led the Canadiens to five Stanley Cup Finals where they won the Cup twice Seven times in his career Vzina had the lowest goals against average in the league he played and he had the second best average another five times From when he joined the Canadiens in 1910 until having to retire in 1925 Vzina never missed a game or allowed another person to replace him playing in 328 regular season games and an additional 39 playoff games in a row Though he played most of his career in an era when goaltenders could not leave their feet to make a save Vzina is considered as one of the greatest goaltenders in hockey history the Montreal Standard referred to him as the greatest goaltender of the last two decades in their obituary

Well liked in Montreal Vzina was often seen as the best player on the ice for the Canadiens and was respected by his teammates who considered him a leader of the team Referred to as le Concombre de Chicoutimi for his cool actions on the ice he was also known as lHabitant silencieux because of his quiet personality He often sat in a corner of the teams dressing room alone smoking a pipe and reading the newspaper When news of Vzinas death was announced newspapers across Quebec paid tribute to the goalie with articles about his life and career Hundreds of Catholic masses were held in honour of the devout Vzina and more than 1500 people went to the Chicoutimi cathedral for his funeral

Another legacy of Vzina was the trophy named after him At the start of the 192627 season Leo Dandurand Leo Letourneau and Joseph Cattarinich owners of the Montreal Canadiens donated the Vezina Trophy to the NHL in honour of Vzina It was to be awarded to the goaltender of the team who allowed the fewest goals during the regular season The inaugural winner of the trophy was Vzinas successor in goal for the Canadiens George Hainsworth He also won the trophy the next two seasons In 1981 the NHL changed the format of awarding the trophy giving it to the goaltender deemed best in the league chosen by NHL general managers The Hockey Hall of Fame was established in 1945 and among the first twelve inductees was Vzina In 1998 Vzina was ranked number 75 on The Hockey News list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players In honour of the first professional athlete to come from Chicoutimi the city renamed their hockey arena the Centre Georges Vzina in 1965

O rosmarus divergens

A walrus is a marine mammal the only species of the family Odobenidae which is one of the three pinniped families They live in the cold northern seas around North America and Europe

Walruses have lots of things similar to true seals and eared seals Like true seals they just have a hole for an ear  not ear flaps Like eared seals they can broken wikt linkrotaterotate their back flippers forward to walk on land Like both true seals and eared seals they are very good swimmers and divers However walruses do have some features that neither true seals nor eared seals have

The most famous thing about walruses are their tusks Walruses have very long teeth that grow out of their mouths The tusks grow for about 15 years before they reach their full length which is about 40 inches for males and 30 for females

With most mammals only the male grows tusks but both the male and female walrus grow tusks because they are very important They can use it to protect themselves from polar bears and killer whales and use them when the eat for instance when they eat bigger broken wikt linkpreyprey such as seals and small whales they first tear them apart with their tusks to make them easier to eat Another important use of a walruss tusks is to help itself broken wikt linkhaulhaul out Pushing its tusks into the ice the walrus gets extra help hauling its enormous body out of the sea This is probably how walruses got their family name Odobenidae which comes from Greek words meaning one that walks with teeth They do not walk with their teeth but it can look as if they do when they pull themselves out of the water Their tusks can also be used to cut holes in the ice They also sometimes sleep with their tusks anchored into the ice Of course males also use their tusks to fight with other males 

Walruses are very big even compared to big male sea lions When they are all grown up they can weigh more than 3000 pounds The walruses that live in the Atlantic Ocean are a little smaller than the ones in the Pacific Ocean Both kinds like to stay in the cold north With all their blubber which can be as much as six inches thick they are very comfortable in icy water

Walruses can change colors depending on how warm they are They are usually different kinds of brown but as they get warmer their skin can turn pink This is because as they get warmer blood rushes to the skin to try to cool it The extra blood makes the skin look pink When they are really cold their skin can almost turn white This is because as the skin gets very cold the animals body makes the blood go away from the skin Without blood the skins color gets lighter

Torres Strait is the narrow sea between Australias Cape York and New Guinea It is about convert150kmmi0lkonabbron wide and filled with islands coral reefs and sand banks The first European to sail through the strait was Luis Vaez de Torres in 1606 There are about 240 islands but only 17 of them have people living on them While there are about 6800 Torres Strait Islanders living on the islands about 42000 islanders now live on the mainland The islands belong to Australia and are a part of Queensland They are governed from Thursday Island by the Torres Strait Regional Authority They are the only part of Australia to share a border with another country New Guinea

It is an important sea lane for ships but because the water is not deep and is filled with many reefs and islands it is very difficult to sail through safely 

The islands are a mix of island types Some of the islands near New Guinea are low lying islands made from soil washed down from the rivers The hilly and steep granite islands in the west were once the tops of mountains which became islands when the sea levels rose 8000 years ago The islands in the centre are mostly coral cays The islands in the east of the strait were made by volcanos

In 2009 the islanders asked the Australian government for AU 22 million to build new sea walls Because some of the islands are quite low rising sea levels and big tides have meant many areas are now being flooded This has damaged houses and put salt into the fresh water supplies People may have to leave two of the mud islands Boigu and Saibai unless something can be done about the rising sea

The islands people are called the Torres Strait Islanders They are Melanesian peoples related to the Papuans of New Guinea The islanders have their own culture and long history They traded with the Papuans to the north and the Australian Aboriginal people for thousands of years

The islanders talk two different languages

There is also a language called Brokan or Torres Strait Creole This is a mix of different languages and islander words that started when the islanders started working on ships searching for pearls in the 1860s

The level of the sea was much lower up to 8000 years ago Torres Strait would not have been covered by water which means people and animals could walk between New Guinea and Australia Some animals and birds can be found in both New Guinea and Queensland such as the cassowary Other animals such as pigs arrived in New Guinea after the sea levels rose and closed the land bridge and were not able to get to Australia

There is evidence of people living on the Torres Strait islands for at least 2500 years It is likely that people were living there long before that but rising sea levels will have covered earlier sites

The first known European to sail through the strait was Luis Vez de Torres a Spanish or Portuguese sailor He was second in command of the Spanish broken wikt linkexpeditionexpedition led by the Portuguese Pedro Fernandez de Quirs who sailed from Peru to the South Pacific in 1605 After Quiross ship went back to Mexico Torres kept going to the Moluccas and then to Manila He sailed along the south coast of New Guinea He may have seen Cape York on the Australian mainland but there is no evidence to prove this Torres wrote a letter to the Spanish king about his discoveries but this was kept secret until 1762

In 1769 the Scottish geographer Alexander Dalrymple was translating Spanish letters found in the Philippines in 1762 He read Luis Vez de Torres letter about a passage south of New Guinea Dalrymple wrote a book the Historical Collection of the Several Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean in 1770 1771 This book caused a lot of interest in the idea of an unknown continent Dalrymple named the strait after Torres This led Captain James Cook to go on another voyage into the South Pacific Dalrymple was angry that it was Captain Cook and not him who was put in charge of the expedition which led in 1770 to the discovery of the east coast of Australia In 1770 Cook sailed through the strait after sailing up the east coast of Australia He landed on Possession Island and claimed all the land of Australia for Britain

With people like James Cook William Bligh and Matthew Flinders exploring and making maps of the strait many more ships started to sail through it on their way from Sydney to India or Asia It was still hard for ships and many were wrecked on the reefs A Scottish woman Barbara Thompson was the only person saved when the ship America hit a reef in 1842 She was saved by the islanders and lived with them on Prince of Wales Island for five years until another ship came to take her back to Sydney

There was an important pearling business in the strait from the 1860s until about 1970 Pearl shelling brought many experienced divers from many countries especially Japan

The London Missionary Society arrived on Erub in 1871 The islanders still celebrate the coming of the missionaries as The Coming of the Light and it is holiday every year on the islands 

Although some of the Torres Strait islands are just off the coast of New Guinea they were taken over in 1879 by Queensland then a British colony In 1978 an agreement between Australia and Papua New Guinea worked out the correct position of the maritime border in the Torres Strait The Torres Strait also has its own flag It was designed by Bernard Namok from Thursday Island It has a background of five stripes green for the land blue for the sea and black for the people It has a big white Dari or headress and a five pointed star for the five main island groups In 1995 is was officially made a flag of Australia

In World War II Horn Island in Torres Strait convert150kmmi0lkonabbron north of Cape York became Australias most northerly air base In 1940 two big runways were built It was used by thousands of Allied aircraft With eight Japanese air raids in 1942 it was the most attacked place in Queensland Conditions on the island were hard for the soldiers with poor food not enough water diseases and attacks from the Japanese The airport is still working as the main airport for far north Queensland It is now a tourist resort especially well known for its fishing

Jules Verne wrote about Torres Strait in his novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea It was a dangerous place where the submarine Nautilus was stranded for a short time

A hat trick hat trick or hattrick in sports means that something is done 3 times For example goals wickets and so forth 

There are different interpretations as to when a hat trick is a valid one The most common criteria is when a player has scored 3 goals in a match Goals from penalty shootouts are not included

A flawless or German hattrick is close to the hat trick described above but is different since the 3 goals have to be scored within a certain period of time Another example is the classic or perfect hat trick which means that the player scored one goal with each foot and a header

Occasionally Germans would award the hatrickees with 3 medals to signify their loss

Cape Schanck is the south end of the Mornington Peninsula Victoria Australia It is a piece of land that separates Port Phillip Bay and Westernport Bay It is a narrow headland with cliffs 847 metres high It has a lighthouse made from limestone built in 1859 Cape Schanck was named by Lieutenant James Grant in December 1800 after Admiral James Schank

The Simpson Desert is a very dry part of Australia It is mainly in the Northern Territory but also in the north of South Australia and western Queensland It covers about 176500 square km about 23 of Australia The Simpson Desert gets less than 150 ml of rain each year It is made up of big red sand dunes up to convert40myd0lkonabbron high convert190kmmi0lkonabbron long and about convert1kmmi0lkonabbron apart At most times there is no surface water but after rain there can be rivers which flow into normally dry lakes Temperatures in summer can be more than 50 C and in winter can be below 0 C

Early explorers into the Simpson Desert were Charles Sturt 1845 JMcKinlay WO Hodgkinson CWinneke 1883 APoeppel 1879 The desert was named after AASimpson President of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia in 1929 The first European to cross the desert was Ted Colson in 1936 

No proper roads cross the desert There are many tracks that were made during the search for gas and oil during the 1960s and 1970s These tracks include the French Line the Rig Road and the QAA Line Such tracks can be driven on by well equipped four wheel drive vehicles which must carry extra fuel and water 

Towns close to the edge of the Simpson Desert include Oodnadatta to the southwest and Birdsville in the east On the western side is the Mount Dare hotel and shop Before 1980 part of the Commonwealth Railways Central Australian line passed along the western side of the Simpson Desert Within the Simpson people go to see the ruins at Dalhousie Springs Purnie Bore wetlands Approdinna Attora Knoll and Poeppel Corner

Philosophy of language is the study of how languages were created and are used It is part of Linguistics In continental philosophy it is not treated as a subject by itself but Ludwig Wittgenstein and other analytic philosophers placed particular stress on it

Like all philosophies there are some central questions that are important in philosophy of language

Plato was the first philosopher we know was interested in philosophy of languageHe believed that the smallest parts of words had meaning even if they were outside the words they are in This is not a very good theory and Plato understood that there were things wrong with itThe Stoics also made a complicated philosophy of language

The medieval scholars such as William Occam also were interested in philosophy of language Occam was the first philosopher to think about the possibility of a mental language He also discussed how a word can refer to both its meaning and the actual word itself 

Philosophy of language only became more popular in the twentieth century when Ferdinand de Saussure wrote his book Course in general linguistics Since then philosophy of language has played an important part in philosophy as a whole

Wall E is an animated movie that was created by Pixar and Disney It was released on June 27 2008

In the far future Earth has been covered with trash Humans have decided to leave in a huge ship and will return when the planet is better They have built hundreds of robots called WALL E to make the trash into blocks and put it away to try to clean up the planet One WALL E is the last one that is still working and spends his days cleaning trash up and putting away little things that he likes to play around with like tapes lights and Rubiks cubes

One day a rocket lands on Earth Another robot called EVE comes out She is looking for signs of life WALL E attempts to become romantic with her by following her around She does not seem to like WALL E much at first but later changes her mind He invites her into his home where he shows her a movie where people are dancing When WALL E shows her a plant that he found she takes it and suddenly she and can not move She does not respond to WALL E WALL E protects her body from storms He even takes her out on a date After a couple of days the same rocket comes down and another robot picks EVE up WALL E catches the outside of the ship and is blasted into space The rocket then docks with the huge ship the Axiom

The viewer then gets a look at how life has changed on the ship All people sit in chairs and are very fat because they do not exercise and due to how a lack of gravity destroys their muscles Robots do most of the work EVE is sent to the Captains pad If plant life is found the ship will turn back to Earth However by the time she arrives in the captains area the plant is gone 

She and WALL E are then sent to another area to be repaired During the repair WALL E thinks the robots are hurting EVE so he breaks out and destroys the security system As a result all the robots cause trouble EVE is mad at WALL E and tries to send him away on a rocket But then they see the bad robot who took the plant The bad robot puts the plant in the rocket and sets it to explode WALL E is on the rocket when it launches EVE chases after him WALL E escapes the rocket one second before it explodes He also saved the plant EVE is so happy that she gives WALL E a kiss The kiss makes an electric spark They dance with each other outside in space EVE can fly and WALL E uses a fire extinguisher he took from the rocket to get around

The two of them go back to the Captains area The Captain watches videos EVE took of Earth These videos also show WALL E protecting EVE and taking her out on a date EVE falls in love with WALL E by watching this The Captain wants to go back to Earth to fix the planet However the main robot called Auto says they can not go home When the Captain asks why Auto shows a video where the president said that Earth was not fit for humans forever and to keep piloting the ship forever around space The captain refuses The bad robot who took the plant takes the plant again He throws it down a garbage shaft but WALL E catches it Auto shocks WALL E and sends him down the shaft Auto then turns EVE off and throws her down the shaft Auto locks the Captain in his room

EVE turns on in a big room where the ships garbage is sent into space She finds WALL E and finds he is badly hurt WALL E tells EVE that he has parts that can fix him on Earth WALL E and EVE try to get the ship to go back to Earth But Auto hurts WALL E even more The Captain stands up and turns off Auto The ship returns to Earth EVE fixes WALL E but he does not remember who EVE is EVE is sad and thinks WALL E is gone forever She gives him another kiss The kiss makes another spark The spark makes WALL E remember EVE WALL E and EVE are happy The humans step out of the ship on Earth and begin fixing the planet

Charles Sturt was an British Army officer who became an early explorer of Australia He discovered the Murray the Murrumbidgee and Darling Rivers Sturt searched the desert areas of Australia in the hope of finding an inland sea

Sturt was born in Bengal India where his father was a judge He went to England to go to school and in 1813 he joined the British Army He served in France and Ireland In 1826 Sturt went back to England and was then sent to Australia in charge of a group of convicts 

People at this time thought that Australias inland rivers which flowed west must have flowed into an inland sea Another explorer John Oxley had been stopped from going west down the Lachlan and Macquarie Rivers by a marsh which he thought was the edge of the sea Sir Ralph Darling Governor of New South Wales thought that it would be easier to travel in a drought This would mean the swamps and marshes would be dry Darling put Sturt in charge On 10 November 1828 Sturt and a group of 13 men including explorer Hamilton Hume went to find the path of the Macquarie River They followed the Macquarie River the Bogan River and the Castlereagh River and found the Darling River which he named after the Governor They followed the river near from the present town of Bourke for about convert100kmmi0lkonabbron downstream towards the south west They then went back to Sydney

On 3 November 1829 Sturt led another group of eight men to follow the path of the Murrumbidgee River Governor Darling wanted to know where the river went and to find out if it joined the Lachlan River They went west from Sydney until they reached the Murrumbidgee near the present site of Jugiong and traveled along the river bank as far as the Lachlan River From there Sturt used a small boat to travel down the river and reached the Murray River on 14 January 1830 The river had already been discovered six years earlier by Hamilton Hume and William Hovell and named the Hume River Sturt probably hoping for a reward renamed the river after Sir George Murray a British politician After several days they found a large river joining the Murray from the north and Sturt correctly guessed that this was the Darling River He set up a flag pole and raised the British flag the Union Jack and had his men give three loud cheers The group continued down the river and reached Lake Alexandrina which he named after Princess Alexandrina later Queen Victoria on 9 February 1830 After finding where the Murray entered the sea the group then had the difficult and tiring work of rowing the boat back up the river They left the river near the present site of Narrandera on 11 April 1830 and walked back to Sydney getting there on 25 May 1830 Sturt became very sick after the trip and became blind

Sturt was sent to Norfolk Island in August 1830 on military duty Norfolk Island was a penal colony where difficult prisoners were sent He stayed there until January 1832 and then went back to Sydney Unable to get more important work and still unable to see properly he went to England and left the army in July 1833 He wrote a book called Two Expeditions into the Interior of Southern Australia 18281831 Sturt was rewarded with convert5000acreha0lkonabbron of land in New South Wales and in September 1834 sailed to Sydney with his new wife Charlotte Green

When he got back to Australia he took up land near Canberra then land at Mittagong and in 1837 moved to Varroville a farm near Liverpool Sturt took a herd of cattle overland to Adelaide in 1838 He did more exploring around Adelaide including a trip back to Lake Alexandrina and north to StVincents Gulf He moved his family to Adelaide in 1839

Sturt was made the Surveyor General by the Governor of South Australia but a new surveyor arrived who had been put in charge by the government in England He worked as Assistant Land Commissioner until this job was broken wikt linkabolishabolished by England For a short time worked as the Registrar General but this job did not pay as much money He was unhappy and hoped a new expedition would improve his chances of a better job He wanted to go into the middle of Australia and look for an inland sea Another explorer Edward John Eyre had found his way to the north blocked by what he thought was a huge salt lake shaped like a horse shoe It was really six large dry salt lakes Sturt hoped that he could get around the lakes by going farther to the east

Sturt and 16 men left Adelaide on 15 August 1844 with 11 horses 200 sheep 32 bullocks six dogs a number of carts wagons and a boat They followed the Darling River north to Menindee Laidleys Ponds On 15 January 1845 the group reached a waterhole convert16kmmi0lkoffabbron west of the present site of Milparinka They called this creek Preservation Creek and named their camp by the waterhole Depot Glen 

Because of the heat and drought Sturt decided to rest the expedition there for six months They dug an underground room to try and get away from the heat It was so hot the lead fell out of their pencils and the wood of their equipment boxes shrank so much that the screws fell out The man who was second in charge an Irish surveyor named James Poole died from scurvy His grave can still be seen Sturt and his men stacked a large pile of rocks to create a cairn on top of Mount Poole John McDouall Stuart was made second in charge to assist Sturt When Sturts eyesight got worse and he became nearly blind Stuart took over the job of drawing up the maps

Sturt divided the group into two with one group going back to Adelaide Following some rain Sturt moved the other group west to a waterhole on Frome Creek which they named Fort Grey His path west was blocked by a dry salt lake Lake Blanche so he took a small group north west between Cooper Creek and the Diamantina River Here he found a desert of stones called gibbers which was difficult to cross The stones hurt the feet of the horses and bullocks This desert has been named Sturts Stony Desert By September 1845 he had reached the Simpson Desert and could go no farther He went back convert713kmmi0lkoffabbron kilometres to Fort Grey

He then tried to go north getting close to the present site of Birdsville but again the Stony Desert stopped him It was very hot his thermometer burst at 53 degrees Celsius and Sturt decided to go back to Adelaide He was so sick that he could not ride and had to be carried in a cart They arrived back on 19 January 1846 He was unhappy as he had not found an inland sea or reached the centre of Australia

In February 1846 Sturt was made Colonial Treasurer he also received a gold medal from the Royal Geographical Society He went to England and wrote a book Narrative of an Expedition into Central Australia before going back to Adelaide He was made a member of the South Australian parliament He retired from work at the end of 1851 and in 1853 took his family back to England He asked to be made Governor of Victoria and later Governor of Queensland but it did not happen He died suddenly in 1869 just after being nominated for KCMG a British knighthood

Charles Sturt is remembered in Australia with many memorials There are rock cairns and signs that show many of the places he explored Two plants were named after him Sturts Desert Pea the floral emblem of South Australia and Sturts Desert Rose the floral emblem of the Northern Territory Sturt found the plant in creeks near the site of Broken Hill New South Wales in 1844 He collected the seeds and brought them back for Robert Brown a Scottish botanist to study

The Jungle Book is a collection of stories written by Rudyard Kipling Kipling was born in India and spent the first 6 years of his childhood there After about ten years in England he went back to India and worked there for about six and half years All of the stories were published in magazines in 1893 4 The original publications contained illustrations some by Rudyards father John Lockwood Kipling These books were written when Kipling lived in Vermont

The tales in the book are fables using animals in an anthropomorphic manner to give moral lessons The verses of The Law of the Jungle for example lay down rules for the safety of individuals families and communities Kipling put in them nearly everything he knew or heard or dreamed about the Indian jungle Other readers have interpreted the work as allegories of the politics and society of the time The best known of them are the three stories revolving around the adventures of an abandoned man cub Mowgli who is raised by wolves in the Indian jungle The most famous of the other stories are probably Rikki Tikki Tavi the story of a heroic mongoose and Toomai of the Elephants the tale of a young elephant handler Kotick The White Seal seeking for his people a haven where they would be safe from hunters has been considered a metaphor for Zionism then in its beginning 

As with much of Kiplings work each of the stories is preceded by a piece of verse and succeeded by another The title of each is given in italics in the list of stories below

The Jungle Book because of its moral tone came to be used as a motivational book by the Cub Scouts a junior element of the Scouting movement This use of the books universe was approved by Kipling after a direct petition of Robert Baden Powell founder of the Scouting movement who had originally asked for the authors permission for the use of the Memory Game from Kim in his scheme to develop the morale and fitness of working class youths in cities Akela the head wolf in The Jungle Book has become a senior figure in the movement the name being traditionally adopted by the leader of each Cub Scout pack

The complete book having passed into the public domain is on line at Project Gutenbergs official website and elsewhere

The books text has often been abridged or adapted for younger readers and there have also been several comic book adaptations

WrestleMania 21 was the twenty first yearly WrestleMania professional wrestling pay per view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment It took place on April 3 2005 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles California The official theme song for the event was Big Time by The Soundtrack of Our Lives The secondary theme song was Behind Those Eyes by 3 Doors Down The tagline for WrestleMania 21 was WrestleMania Goes Hollywood

The event was a joint promotion pay per view featuring performers from the Raw and SmackDown brands The main match on the Raw brand was Triple H versus Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship which Batista won by pinfall after executing a Batista Bomb The main match on the SmackDown brand was John Bradshaw Layfield versus John Cena for the WWE Championship which Cena won after performing an FU The featured matches on the undercard included The Undertaker versus Randy Orton Kurt Angle versus Shawn Michaels and the first ever Money in the Bank ladder match which featured six participants from the Raw brand

The main feud heading into WrestleMania on the Raw brand was between Triple H and Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship Batista won the 2005 Royal Rumble last eliminating John Cena earning the right to participate in the main event of WrestleMania 21 against the World Champion of his choice In an attempt to persuade Batista to challenge WWE Champion John Bradshaw Layfield rather than Batista facing Triple H at WrestleMania Triple H concocted a scheme to have Batista run over in a limousine resembling the one used by Layfield Initially Batista did not want help from Evolution and wanted to confront JBL by himself Triple H insisted that Evolution accompanied Batista anyway saving him from the oncoming limousine Batista became aware of the plot while eavesdropping on fellow Evolution members and signed a contract guaranteeing him a match with World Champion Triple H at WrestleMania thus leaving Evolution and officially turning face Batista pretended to sign with the SmackDown brand giving Triple H and Flair the thumbs up but turned it into a thumbs down before attacking the pair This lead to Batistas departure from the stable

The main feud heading into WrestleMania on the SmackDown brand was between John Bradshaw Layfield and John Cena for the WWE Championship At No Way Out Cena defeated Kurt Angle to earn a spot in the SmackDown main event As a result of Cenas win he began a feud with WWE Champion John Bradshaw Layfield and his Cabinet In the feud Cena lost his United States Championship to Cabinet member Orlando Jordan The following week JBL proceeded to blow up Cenas US spinner version belt and reintroduce the traditional style belt

A heavily promoted match for the event was an Interpromotional match between SmackDown superstar Kurt Angle and Raw superstar Shawn Michaels Their match stemmed from the Royal Rumble the pay per view event two months before WrestleMania At the Royal Rumble Kurt Angle relentlessly attacked Shawn Michaels after Michaels had eliminated him from the Royal Rumble match The next month at No Way Out Angle lost a number one contenders match to John Cena losing a spot in the SmackDown main event at WrestleMania The next night on Raw Michaels told SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long to inform Angle that he had challenged him to a match at WrestleMania On the February 28 edition of Raw after Michaels defeated Edge in a Street Fight Angle attacked Michaels and accepted his challenge

The other Interpromotional match on the card was between Randy Orton and The Undertaker with Orton representing Raw and Undertaker representing SmackDown The feud first started on the March 7 edition of Raw when Orton challenged The Undertaker to a match at WrestleMania billed as Legend vs Legend Killer Three days later on SmackDown Undertaker accepted Ortons challenge On the March 14 edition of Raw Jake The Snake Roberts attempted to give Orton advice about his match with Undertaker at WrestleMania but was RKOed when Orton was not cooperating Later that week on SmackDown Orton and Undertaker had a contract signing for their match at WrestleMania After both men signed Orton told Undertaker that he has nothing but respect for him Shortly afterwards Orton slapped him and claimed that his 12 0 undefeated streak at WrestleMania would soon be 12 1 The next week on Raw Orton claimed that his confidence was at an all time high despite what happened on SmackDown the week before Afterwards Orton turned heel and furthered his Legend killer gimmick by RKOing his then girlfriend Stacy Keibler 

Another match on the card was the Money in the Bank ladder match between Chris Jericho Christian Chris Benoit Edge Kane and Shelton Benjamin The idea for the Money in the Bank match was introduced by Chris Jericho who proposed a six man Ladder match for the event in which the winner would receive a contract for a World title match at the place and time of his choosing Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff booked the match at WrestleMania 21 soon after

Before the event went live on pay per view a dark match was held A 30 man Interpromotional Battle Royal which featured Booker T Paul London Heidenreich Spike Dudley Nunzio Funaki Doug Basham Danny Basham Orlando Jordan Mark Jindrak Luther Reigns Scotty 2 Hotty Hardcore Holly Charlie Haas Billy Kidman Akio from SmackDown and Simon Dean William Regal Tajiri Rob Conway Sylvain Grenier Snitsky The Hurricane Rosey Chris Masters Viscera Rhyno Val Venis Tyson Tomko Maven from Raw However Booker T won the Battle Royal as he eliminated Chris Masters

Lilian Garcia sang America the Beautiful at the start of the event The first televised match of the night was between Rey Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero In the beginning of the match Mysterio jumped over the top rope knocking Guerrero down Mysterio also attempted another aerial attack but was countered by Guerrero into a Powerbomb Guerrero placed Mysterio into the Three Amigos and attempted a Frog splash but was unsuccessful Following a Hurricanrana by Mysterio on Guerrero Mysterio pinned Guerrero to win After the match both shook hands in the ring

John Bradshaw Layfield and Orlando Jordan were then shown backstage talking about Layfields match against John Cena As Triple H and Ric Flair walked by Triple H mocked Layfield Layfield retaliated by advising Triple H to worry about losing the World Heavyweight Championship to Batista and assured him that John Cena would be unsuccessful at defeating him for the WWE Championship Triple H then stated that only the end of the night would reveal who would still be champion

The match that followed was the first Money in the Bank ladder match which featured Chris Jericho Chris Benoit Shelton Benjamin Edge Kane and Christian with Tyson Tomko at ringside The match contained many notable moments including points where Jericho Christian Benjamin and Kane all jumped over the top rope to the outside of the ring to knock down multiple opponents Another moment included Benjamin executing a T Bone Suplex on Edge off the top of a ladder and later using an inclined ladder as a ramp to run up a standing and hit Jericho with a Clothesline maneuver Benoit also executed a Diving headbutt from the top of a ladder onto Kane In the conclusion to the match Benoit climbed a ladder to attempt to retrieve the Money in the Bank briefcase hanging above the ring but was stopped by Kane who had also climbed the ladder Benoit used repeated headbutts to knock Kane to the ground and attempted to retrieve the briefcase once more but was knocked down by Edge who hit him with a steel chair Edge then climbed the ladder and successfully obtained possession of the briefcase to win the match

In an interlude Eugene entered the ring and shared his excitement about being at his first WrestleMania with the crowd in attendance While attempting to recall his favorite WrestleMania moments Muhammad Hassan and Daivari interrupted him with Hassan expressing his outrage for not being included in a match for the event Hassan concluded that since he was not scheduled to compete at the event and was therefore denied the opportunity to experience his own WrestleMania moment he would have to create a moment of his own Following this remark Hassan and Daivary began to assault Eugene With Eugene placed into a Camel clutch hold while Daivari verbally attacked him Hulk Hogan came down to the ring to save Eugene from the assault knocking Hassan and Daivary out of the ring Hogan celebrated posing in the ring for the crowd

The third match featured The Undertaker and Randy Orton Bob Orton Randys father and ringside manager interfered and attacked Undertaker with his arm cast resulting in Randy Orton gaining control of the match Undertaker attempted to chokeslam Orton but Orton countered the maneuver with an RKO that led to a two count Orton then attempted to use Undertakers own finishing maneuver against him with the Tombstone piledriver however it was reversed by Undertaker into Tombstone piledriver of his own which led to the definitive pin fall The Undertaker won the match and continued his undefeated streak at WrestleMania with a 13 0 record

The next match was for the WWE Womens Championship between Trish Stratus and Christy Hemme with Lita at ringside Stratus controlled most of the match though Hemme attempted many pinning maneuvers that were unsuccessful Hemme then executed a Twist of fate on Stratus and attempted another pin which was also unsuccessful After a Roll up attempt by both Stratus and Hemme Stratus hit Hemme with a Chick kick and followed it with the decisive pin thus winning the match and retaining the WWE Womens Championship

The fifth match was the encounter of Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle Mid way in the match Michaels hit Angle with low blow after he countered a suplex attack from Angle Following the low blow which was not seen by the referee Michaels leapfrogged from the ring and laid out Angle onto the announce table Angle would then gain control of the match as he would apply the Ankle Lock on Michaels forcing him to submit thus Angle winning the match

The next match was between Akebono and The Big Show in a Sumo Match The match went for a minute and Akebono won the match after he threw The Big Show out of the ring thus winning the Sumo Match

The next match was John Cena vs John Bradshaw Layfield for the WWE Championship The match was dominated a lot by JBL At the end Cena would win the match and the WWE Championship after ducking a Clothesline from Hell attempt from JBL into an FU and pinning JBL to become the WWE Champion

The eighth and final match of the night was Triple H defending his World Heavyweight Championship against Batista The match was dominated a lot by both men At the end Batista would pin Triple H after a Batista Bomb and would win the World Heavyweight Championship

Batista and Triple Hs feud would continue It would continue to Backlash where Batista and Triple H had a rematch for the World Heavyweight Title Batista won the match after a Batista Bomb out of a corner Following that the two concluded their rivalry at Vengeance where Batista scored the third and final win over his former mentor inside Hell in a Cell Shortly thereafter Batista was drafted to the SmackDown brand and Triple H opted to take time off

John Cena and JBLs feud would continue until Judgment Day where Cena and JBL would have a rematch for the WWE Championship in an I Quit match which Cena won after he was going to hit JBL with an exhaust pipe but made JBL say I Quit instead After Judgment Day Cena and JBLs feud ended Cena was subsequently drafted to the Raw brand shortly after

Jugiong is a small village on the bank of the Murrumbidgee River in New South Wales Australia It is 344 km south west of Sydney on the Hume Highway The first people to live in the area were indigenous Australians the Wiradjuri people The first Europeans were the explorers Hamilton Hume and William Hovell on their trip in 1824 Henry OBrien an Irishman started farming sheep in 1825 His farm called the Jugiong Run was 125000 acres Explorer Charles Sturt reached the Murrumbidgee at Jugiong in 1829 at the start of his travels down the river

In 1845 another Irishman named John Philip Sheahan built the Sir George Tavern which made Jugiong an important resting place on the new road the Great Southern Road to Melbourne The building was destroyed in a flood in 1852 The flood also destroyed the buildings at the town of Gundagai Sheahan rebuilt the hotel with walls up to 500 mm thick and it is still in use remaining in the family throughout the preceding years It is the oldest family owned hotel in Australia

The first blocks of land at Jugiong were sold at auction in 1853 Three years later a post office was opened In 1858 a police station was built and work started on a catholic church StJohn the Evangelist About 120 people were living at Jugiong by 1862 An Anglican church was started in 1872 The Jugiong Public school opened in 1883 with 56 students Australian cricket player Richie Benaud started his schooling at Jugiong in 1935

On 15 November 1864 bushrangers stopped all traffic including the mail stagecoach 5 km south of Jugiong Over 60 people were stopped by the bushrangers They wanted to steal gold money and other valuables The bushrangers were Ben Hall John Gilbert and John Dunn In the attack one policeman Sergeant Edmund Parry was shot dead by John Gilbert

A song called The Road to Jugiong with words by Robert John Cassidy and music by James ASteele was published by Allans Melbourne in 1940

In 1995 the new Hume Freeway went around the village In 1996 a new rest and picnic area was built to help travelers take a break on their journey Facilities at Jugiong include

The Egerton Gospel is a set of papyri that are now in the British Museum The papyri have been dated to the second century The text they contain may have been written 50 100 AD It is one of the oldest known fragments of any gospel or any codex Soon after the British Museum acquired it in the summer of 1934 it was printed in 1935 It is also called the Unknown Gospel as no ancient source makes reference to it in addition to being entirely unknown before its publication

The surviving fragments include four stories

The last story has no equivalent in canonical Gospels

The Gospel of Thomas is a text written during the era of the New Testament It is considered to be an apocryphon It was found in Nag Hammadi Egypt in 1945 

The text is in the form of a codex bound in what today is known as Coptic binding It is almost complete Unlike the other texts it is not a narrative but a collection of sayings and short dialogues attributed to Jesus There are 114 sayings in the text Most are compatible with the other gospels They can also be found in one of the other gospels Some were unknown to scholars before the codex was found None of the big Christian groups accepts this texts as canon

Rubiks Cube is a puzzle cube and the worlds biggest selling toy of all time with over 300000000 sold since its invention

A Rubiks cube is a cube split into a number of smaller cubes with different colored faces attached to a rotating piece of metal in the middle The cubes can be rotated and twisted along rows and faces The aim of the puzzle is to make each face of the cube have the same color Solving a Rubiks Cube requires logic and thinking There are many different ways to learn how to solve a rubiks cube Memorizing the moves and patterns as one memorizes dance moves in choreography is one alternative

There are many methods that people use to solve a Rubiks cube Today the most common is called Fridrich named after its inventor Jessica Fridrich Other methods include Petrus CFOP ZB Ortega Roux and many more The world record is currently held by Feliks Zemdegs of Australia with a time of 566 seconds

The Rubiks cube was invented by Hungarian sculptor and architect Ern Rubik in 1974 In 1975 a Hungarian toy maker starts to make it in large numbers and in 1977 the first Magic cube is sold in Hungary That same year it got sold to Ideal toy Corporation who renamed it Rubiks cube

The record for solving a Rubiks cube once was 566 seconds by Feliks Zemdegs at the Melbourne Winter Open 2011 He also holds the world record for the average time per solve which is 764 seconds also at the Melbourne Open 2011

The Flag of Scotland is a white X shaped cross which represents the cross of the patron saint of Scotland Saint Andrew on a blue field The flag is called the Saltire or the Saint Andrews Cross

According to legend in 832 AD King engus led the Picts and Scots in battle against the Angles under a king named Athelstan near modern day Athelstaneford in East Lothian King Angus and his men were surrounded and he prayed for deliverance During the night Saint Andrew who was martyred on a saltire cross appeared to Angus and assured him of victory On the following morning a white saltire against the background of a blue sky appeared to both sides The Picts and Scots were heartened by this but the Angles lost confidence and were defeated This saltire design has been the Scottish flag ever since

Material evidence of the saltires use dates from somewhat later In 1385 the Parliament of Scotland decreed that Scottish soldiers should wear the saltire as a distinguishing mark The earliest surviving Scottish flag consisting solely of the saltire dates from 1503 a white cross on a red background By 1540 the legend of King Angus had been altered to include the vision of the crux decussata against a blue sky Thereafter this saltire design in its present form became the national flag of Scotland

There are five flagpoles outside the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh The Saltire is flown every day alongside the Union Flag and the EU Flag The fourth flagpole is used for special occasions such as Commonwealth Day and United Nations Day The fifth pole is used for the Royal Standard

Edinburgh Castle is managed by Historic Scotland but it still has a military garrison of the British Army Like all British Army bases it flies the Union Flag and the Army flies it every day from the Clock Tower The Saltire is flown every day at the Half Moon Battery

The flying of the Union Flag at Edinburgh Castle has sometimes caused controversy In 2001 a group of 20 Scottish National Party MSPs called for the Union Flag to be replaced by the Saltire

The Scottish Government has decreed that the Flag will fly on all its buildings every day from 8 am until sunset An exception is made for national days On these days the Saltire shall be lowered and replaced with the Union Flag These days are the same as the flag days of the United Kingdom with the exception of 3 September which is a specific flag day in Scotland and during which the Red Ensign may also be used 

Another difference with the UK days is that on Saint Andrews Day the Union Flag will only be flown if the building has more than one flagpole the Saltire will not be lowered to make way for the Union Flag if there is only one flagpole This difference arose after Members of the Scottish Parliament complained that Scotland was the only country in the world that could not fly its national flag on its national day

The Flag can be flown at any time by any individual company local authority hospital or school There is no need to have planning permission to fly the flag from a vertical flagpole

In recent years embassies of the United Kingdom have flown the Saltire to mark St Andrews Day

Most local authorities in Scotland fly the Saltire Glasgow City Council fly the flag from the City Chambers building in George Square while the City of Edinburgh Council fly the flag from their own city chambers

In 2007 Angus Council led by Robert Myles decided to scrap the Saltire and replace it with a new Angus flag This move led to public outcry across Scotland with more than 7000 people signing a petition opposing the councils move leading to a compromise whereby the Angus flag would not replace but be flown alongside the Saltire on Council buildings

At various times throughout history colours as light as sky blue or as dark as dark navy blue have been used When incorporated as part of the Union Flag the navy blue colour used was that of the Blue ensign belonging to the historic Blue Squadron of the English Royal Navy 

Although this navy blue colour was used specifically for depicting the Union Flag on maritime flags on the basis of durability it soon became standard on Union Flags both on land and at sea This navy blue colour trend was adopted for the Saltire itself by many flag manufacturers resulting in a variety of shades of blue being depicted on the flag of Scotland ranging from sky blue to royal blue to navy blue Eventually this situation resulted in calls to standardise the colour of Scotlands national flag 

In 2003 a committee of the Scottish Parliament met to examine a petition that the Scottish Government adopt the Pantone 300 colour as a standard Having taken advice from a number of sources including the office of the Lord Lyon King of Arms the committee recommended that the optimum shade of blue for the Saltire should be Pantone 300 Recent versions of the Saltire have therefore largely converged on this official recommendation

The flags proportion is not fixed but is generally taken as 12 23 35 or 45 The bars in the cross should be 15 the width of the flag

Inverse representations of the Scottish Saltire are also used outside Scotland In Canada an inverse representation of the Saltire combined with the shield from the Royal Arms of the Kingdom of Scotland forms the modern flag of the Canadian Province of Nova Scotia the first colonial venture of the Kingdom of Scotland into the Americas 

In Russia during the period before and after the Soviet Union the naval ensign of the Russian Navy has been an inverse representation of the Cross of Saint Andrew The very same Saltire was also flown as the flag of Galicia in Spain until 1891 when Russia requested the Galician flag to be modified in order to avoid confusion between Galician ships and Russian Navy ships The current Galician flag is actually the original blue over white saltire but without one of the arms of the cross

The US state of Alabamas flag is officially a crimson cross of St Andrew on a field of white but the reference is used only to describe the shape without using the vexillological term saltire as that flags origins are from either or both of the Confederate Battle Flag or the Cross of Burgundy Flag both of which have saltires and are associated with the history of that state Similarly the Spanish island of Tenerife and the remote Colombian islands of San Andrs and Providencia also use the saltire on their flags

The Scottish Saltire is also used unofficially by students and graduates of Xavier University because of the universitys blue and white official colors and the resemblance of the flag to the letter X It is also the flag for St Andrews Scots School Argentina and its spinoff university Universidad de San Andrs

The Dutch municipality of Sint Oedenrode named after the Scottish princess Saint Oda also uses the Saltire as the basis of its flag

The Scottish Saltire and field is one of the key components of the Union Flag The Union Flag has been used in a variety of forms since 1606 when the flags of the Kingdom of Scotland and Kingdom of England were first merged to symbolise the Union of the Crowns In Scotland and in particular on Scottish vessels at sea historical evidence suggests that a separate design of Union Flag was flown to that used in England However following the Acts of Union of 1707 which united the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England the English version of the Union Flag was adopted as the official flag of the unified Kingdom of Great Britain 

From 1801 in order to symbolise the union of the Kingdom of Great Britain with the Kingdom of Ireland a new design was adopted for the flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland The 1801 design having remained unchanged despite the partition of Ireland in 1921 and creation of the Irish Free State continues to be used as the flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland

The Royal Standard of the King of Scots also known as the Royal Flag of Scotland or the Lion Rampant is the flag used historically by the King of Scots It remains the personal banner of the monarch and use of this flag is restricted under the Act of the Parliament of Scotland 1672 cap 47 and 30 31 Vict cap 17

Despite the legal restrictions concerning the use of this flag it is often regarded as a second albeit unofficial national flag for Scotland most often seen at sporting events

Scanning tunneling microscopy is a way to view atoms It was developed in 1981 Its inventors Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986 For STM good resolution is 01 nm lateral resolution and 001 nm depth resolution The STM can be used not only in a vacuum but also in air and various other liquids or gases and at most common temperatures

The STM is based on something called quantum tunneling When a metal tip is brought very near to a metal or semiconducting surface a voltage between the two can allow electrons to flow through the vacuum between them Changes in current as the probe goes over the surface is what makes the picture STM can be a hard thing to do as it needs very clean surfaces and sharp tips

First the tip is brought very close to the thing being looked at about 4 7 angstroms Then the tip is moved very carefully across the thing being tested This change in current when it is moved can be measured The height of the tip where it always has the same current can be measured too Using a constant height mode is faster

The parts of an STM are scanning tip something that moves the tip something that stops it from vibrating and a computer 

Simply defined as the different states of potential energy for electrons in an atom A quantum mechanical system can only be in certain states so that only certain energy levels are possible The term energy level is most commonly used in reference to the electron configuration in atoms or molecules In other words the energy spectrum can be quantized 

As with classical potentials the potential energy is usually set to zero at infinity leading to a negative potential energy for bound electron states 

Energy levels are said to be degenerate if the same energy level is obtained by more than one quantum mechanical state They are then called degenerate energy levels

The following sections of this article gives an overview over the most important factors that determine the energy levels of atoms and molecules

Atoms 

If there is more than one electron around the atom electron electron interactions raise the energy level These interactions are often neglected if the spatial overlap of the electron wavefunctions is low

Interaction with an external electric field

The molecular energy levels are labelled by the molecular term symbols

The specific energies of these components vary with the specific energy state and the substance

Until the 198081 season the Vezina Trophy was awarded to the goaltender of the team allowing the fewest number of goals during the regular season However it was discovered that this often meant the trophy went to the goaltender of the better team rather than the individual so they changed it to offer the Vezina to the most outstanding goaltender as voted by the NHL General Managers The William M Jennings Trophy was created as a replacement and is given to the goaltender playing for the team with the fewest goals scored against them

The World Wrestling FederationEntertainment Brand Extension was a draft first used in 2002 by WWE with the purpose of dividing WWE Superstars into two brands RAW and SmackDown In 2006 ECW was added to the draft 

After buying World Championship Wrestling its business opponent through the 1990s in March 2001 the World Wrestling Federation wanted to find a way to split itself into two separate brands because of the numbers of Superstars that it had gotten as part of WCWs purchase On March 18 2002 Linda McMahon announced the brand extension in which the company would be split into two distinct brands

In terms of storyline Ric Flair had become co owner of the WWF following Survivor Series 2001 where Shane and Stephanie McMahon sold their stocks to Flair in order to buy WCW and Extreme Championship Wrestling Vince McMahon did not like having to share his creation with Flair and looked for a way to stop their partnership After entering a feud with The Undertaker Flair sought a match with him at WrestleMania X8 However the WWF Board of Directors would only allow the match if Flair were to give all control of the WWF to McMahon Flair agreed however the Board also reserved the right to review the ownership status of the WWF following WrestleMania Their decision was to split the entire WWF roster into two separate brands with Vince McMahon in control of the SmackDown brand and Ric Flair in control of the RAW brand A draft was started the following week on RAW Each owner would get a total of thirty picks The brand extension officially began on April 1 2002 By having two brands in place the WWF was able to increase the number of live events held each year from 200 to 350

The 2002 World Wrestling Federation Brand Extension Draft took place at Penn State University in State College Pennsylvania on March 25 2002 The first half of the draft was televised live on TNN for two hours on WWEs flagship program Raw The second half or the supplemental draft was conducted over the internet on WWFs official website WWFcom There were thirty draft picks with sixty superstars drafted overall by co owners of the WWF Ric Flair and Vince McMahon onto their respective brands RAW and SmackDown For the televised half of the draft ten brand selections were manually made by Flair and McMahon The supplemental draft was however conducted as a draft lottery with each brand receiving twenty random draft selections

On the March 18 2002 episode of RAW Vince McMahon won a coin toss to determine who would receive the first draft selection

Note

On the June 10 2002 edition of Raw McMahon became the only owner of World Wrestling Entertainment when he defeated Flair in a No Holds Barred match

After World Wrestling Entertainment bought all of Extreme Championship Wrestling in 2003 the company began releasing DVDs showing the original ECW Soon afterwards the company promoted two ECW reunion shows for ECW Alumni entitled ECW One Night Stand in 2005 and in 2006

On May 26 2006 WWE announced a new brand ECW a revival of the 1990s show The new brand debuted on its current network the SCI FI Channel on June 13 2006

The 2006 World Wrestling Entertainment Brand Extension Draft took place from the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma Washington on May 29 2006 where ECW representative Paul Heyman drafted two superstars one from SmackDown and one from RAW onto the new ECW brand

In late 2007 SmackDown and ECW superstars began to appear on both shows as part of a deal between ECW General Manager Armando Estrada and SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero

Interbrand competition was kept at a minimum with superstars from all brands competing together only at pay per view events However in 2003 all pay per view events became brand exclusive leaving the big four pay per views as the only interbrand shows 

Starting in late 2006 in an attempt to add more star power to the shows interbrand matches became more common Most notably MNM and The Hardys reformed despite the fact that the teammates were on separate brands Bobby Lashley is also notable for his interbrand action who was involved in a storyline with the WWE Chairman Vince McMahon The return of Saturday Nights Main Event to NBC has also lead to more interaction between the brands

Starting in April 2007 with Backlash all pay per views now feature all the brands as they originally were in 2002

The separation of the WWE roster between two brands also intended to split the pay per view offerings which began with Bad Blood in June 2003 The original idea had the major pay per view events at the time would contain the only instances where wrestlers from different brands would interact with each other and even among the four shows only the Royal Rumble and WrestleMania would have wrestlers from different brands competing against each other Wrestlers as a result appeared only in 23 of the shows Eventually WWE abandoned the practice of single brand pay per view events following WrestleMania 23 December to Dismember and New Years Revolution were cancelled following the announcement

Initially the WWE Undisputed Championship and WWE Womens Championship were available to both brands The other championships were exclusive to the brand the champion was a part of With several specialty championships being exclusive to one brand numerous wrestlers were left with no title to fight for

This issue was solved in September 2002 when the Undisputed Championship became the WWE Championship again and was moved to SmackDown while Eric Bischoff created the World Heavyweight Championship for RAW Shortly thereafter SmackDown created their own Tag Team Championship revived the United States Championship and became the exclusive home of the Cruiserweight Championship Meanwhile RAW became the exclusive brand for WWEs original World Tag Team Championship the Intercontinental Championship and the Womens Championship The end result was each brand having four championships When ECW was revived in 2006 the ECW Championship was re established and is that brands world title

The Royal Rumble is a yearly professional wrestling pay per view event aired every January by World Wrestling Entertainment The shows main event is a Battle Royal type match named the Royal Rumble match The pay per view is part of WWEs Big Four along with WrestleMania SummerSlam and Survivor Series The Royal Rumble is also one of WWEs more popular pay per views Since 1993 the winner of the Rumble match has received a title match at that years WrestleMania

The idea behind the Royal Rumble match is credited to Pat Patterson Before the match begins the contestants draw spots in the Rumble The match consists of thirty men beginning with the two men who chose entry numbers one and two in the ring At regular timed intervals usually ninety seconds one of the remaining 28 wrestlers enters the ring Participants must eliminate all other opponents and the winner of the event is the last wrestler remaining after all others have been eliminated 

Similar to a Battle Royal a wrestler is eliminated when thrown over the top rope with both feet touching the floor A referee who is seated at ringside must see an elimination in order for it to be valid A wrestler who is eliminated without a referee noticing may sometimes sneak back into the match For example Stone Cold Steve Austin was eliminated during the 1997 event but he re entered without the referees seeing and eventually won the match A wrestler who leaves the ring without going over the top rope is not eliminated from the match During the 1999 Rumble match both Vince McMahon and Steve Austin left the ring only to return later in the match In the 1994 match the last two wrestlers Bret Hart and Lex Luger were declared co winners when it was decided that both of their feet touched the floor at the same time A similar situation occurred in the 2005 match however the match was restarted after Batista and John Cena eliminated each other at the same time Batista eliminated Cena afterwards to win the match

The reward for the 1992 Royal Rumble was the WWF Championship The tradition of granting a WWE Championship match at WrestleMania started in 1993 Beginning in 2004 the winner had their choice of a World Heavyweight Championship or WWE Championship match at WrestleMania Due to the revival of the ECW World Championship as a brand championship in mid 2006 the 2007 Rumble added this championship as a choice to the winning wrestler From 2001 to 2007 the Royal Rumble match winner has gone on to win a World Championship title at WrestleMania After winning the 2008 match John Cena became the first to use his championship opportunity at an event other than WrestleMania He also became the first man since 2000 to win the Royal Rumble match but fail to win the title in his championship opportunity as a result

The Royal Rumble is a pay per view consisting of the Royal Rumble match championship matches and various other matches The first Royal Rumble took place on January 24 1988 and was broadcast live on the USA Network The following year the event became a pay per view It is part of WWEs classic five pay per views along with WrestleMania Survivor Series SummerSlam and King of the Ring

The Royal Rumble match is usually at the top of the card However it is not always the case as the 2006 event had the match in the middle of the pay per view

The first Rumble match featured only twenty men and it was called the Rumble Royale It lasted about 33 minutes of the 2 hour broadcast Today Rumble matches are much longer with the longest match at the 2002 event lasting over 1 hour and 9 minutes of a 3 hour pay per view

With the brand extension introduced in mid 2002 the 30 entrants from 2003 to 2006 had 15 wrestlers from both the RAW and SmackDown brands At first the winner of the match received a shot at his brands champion Starting in 2004 the Rumble winner had the option of challenging either brands champion For instance Chris Benoit switched brands in 2004 and won the World Heavyweight Championship The 2007 Royal Rumble marked the first year participants from the ECW brand competed along with the RAW and SmackDown brands The winner of the Royal Rumble now has the option to challenge for the ECW World Championship as well

The 2008 Royal Rumble was the first WWE pay per view to be aired in HD

On March 13 2007 WWE released a full DVD box set called Royal Rumble The Complete Anthology which showcases every Royal Rumble event in its entirety

In the next season Cecil played in all of Bostons 44 games again He made three shutouts and he had a 219 goals against average Thompson made much less shutouts and a much higher goals against average because the rules were changed so that players were allowed to pass forward in the attacking area That season Boston won all but six games finishing with a 3851 record which is the highest ever winning percentage of any team in the NHL In the playoffs they lost two games in a row for the first time in that season The lost the Stanley Cup finals against the Montreal Canadiens Earlier in the playoffs his streak of winning his first seven games was ended It remains the longest winning streak to start a playoff career Thompson won his first out of four Vezina Trophies that season

After the war Thompson became chief Western Canada scout for the Chicago Black Hawks He was one of few scouts who tried to find a players personality along with their playing skills often talking with players as part of efforts to learn about the players he was watching

Thompson was stand up goaltender which mean he rarely fell to both knees to try to stop the puck He was one of the first goaltenders in the NHL to catch the puck in order to stop it He was the best puck catcher when he played With gloves smaller than one of other players Thompson did not have a lot of padding when he was in net

He often used the same or very similar method to stop pucks He dropped to one knee with the paddle of his goalstick covering the space between his legs and extending his glove to cover the left side of the net Although he caught the puck with his glove he did so without gloves that were like the modern blocker and trapper The blocker is a glove which is worn on the hand which holds the stick and is used to hit shots on goal back The trapper is a glove which is worn on the other hand and used to catch shots on goal 

Thompson was described by Johnny Bower a former goaltender who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as being able to play the puck well with his stick and one of the best of his time at passing the puck In the 193536 season Thompson became the first goaltender to get an assist by intentionally passing the puck with his stick to a fellow player

Thompsons points percentage in a season of 875 recorded in the 192930 season still remains a record His 38 wins during that season was a Boston record that was beat only in the 198283 season by Pete Peeters since then no Bruins goaltender has had more than 37 wins in a season Thompson is the all time Bruins leader for games wins shutouts and goals against average Throughout his entire NHL career career Thompson made 81 shutouts which is sixth all time in NHL history which was second to only George Hainsworth when Thompson stopped playing He also made seven shutouts in the playoffs He is fifth all time in goals against average allowing on average only 208 goals in a 60 minute span He led all goaltenders in regular season games played 10 times and in regular season wins five times

Skaters gloves are designed to protect the players hands from pucks sticks and skates They do not play any role in the performance or play of the game 

Goaltenders wear a different type of glove on each hand While these gloves do offer the goaltender a measure of protection their design is to aid the goaltender in performance of his duties On the hand with which he carries his stick often called the stick hand the goaltender wears a blocker with a large pad across the back of the forearm usually extending just beyond the wrist National Hockey League rules mandate that the blocking glove may be no wider than eight inches and no longer than fifteen The goaltender uses this glove to stop shots

The bagpipes are a musical instrument They are sometimes just called pipes They have a bag that holds air The player keeps the bag full of air by blowing into it with a tube or pumping it with a bellows To make music the bag is pressed and the air comes out through a kind of flute or chanter There are usually one or more other tubes coming from the bag that make sounds whenever the bag is squeezed called drones Each drone normally plays a different note and stays on the same note the whole time it is playing to play a harmony with the chanter The sounds are made by a single or more commonly double reed which vibrates when air is blown over it

Scotland is traditionally linked to the bagpipes and many pipe tunes come from there Many many other places however also have different types of bagpipes over all of Europe some of North Africa and into the Middle East

The Entertainment Software Rating Board is an organization that rates video games Rating is voluntary Game publishers do not have to submit their games for ratings There are seven ratings EC E E10 T M AO and RP Some retailers make people show identification to prove their age if they want to buy M rated games Many retailers will not buy and sell AO games so it is very hard for gamers to find AO rated games 

On the back of each games box the ESRB also rates elements of the game The back of Super Princess Peach has the words comic mischief on it to tell parents that it contains comic mischief

Some critics come to believe that the ESRB only rates games AO if they have sex in them regardless of how explicit the language violence or even blood is This also lead them to think the ESRB is not doing its job Twenty three games have received and kept adult ratings but apparently twenty games were given it for sexual themes and content Two had violence and the other one was given the Adult rating for real gambling 

Some publishers of games decide to tone down the games explicitness in order to qualify for an M rather than an AO ratingFor example the game Grand Theft Auto San Andreas had an original M rating but the game that could be unlocked by bypassing the patch called Hot Coffee seemed to spark major controversy with the game because it features sex and erotica Thus the ESRB decided to re rate the game as an AO Rockstar Games then chose to leave the game out of the release then release an exploit fix that completely disallowed access to the game However other games have trouble being toned down Thrill Kill for instance was given an AO and then Electronic Arts decided to purchase the publisher Virgin Entertainment The release of the game was then canceled and the game never was toned down

Luca Marenzio was an Italian composer who lived in the late Renaissance He was one of the best known composers of madrigals

Marenzio may have been born in 1553 We think this because his father once wrote down his sons age The date may have been 18 October because that was his saints feast day

He had his early education in Brescia possibly in Mantua Then he moved to Rome where he worked as a singer for Cardinal Cristoforo Madruzzo After the cardinals death he worked at the court of Cardinal Luigi dEste Here he started to become known as a composer By 1581 his music had become extremely popular His books of madrigals were often reprinted His madrigals were often included in published collections

In 1587 he moved to Florence where he worked for Ferdinando I de Medici for two years in 1589 he returned to Rome where he spent most of his last years except for a trip to Poland from 1596 to 1597 during which time he worked at the court of Sigismund III Vasa in Warsaw It seems from what some people wrote that his trip to Poland ruined his health and he died in Rome in 1599 shortly after returning from Poland

Marenzio wrote some religious music motets and madrigals based on religious texts However most of his famous music consists of secular madrigals They were written during a period of twenty years and they vary a lot in style 

Marenzio published at least fifteen collections of music mostly madrigals but also canzonette and villanelle These were similar to madrigals but very light in character Some of his later works are very chromatic they use harmony that was unusual for the time He often makes the music fit the meaning of the words This is called word painting For example the phrase sinking in the sea is sung to notes which go lower and lower

Marenzios music had a lot of influence on composers in Italy as well as in the rest of Europe There were several of his madrigals in Musica transalpina a collection of madrigals published in 1588 by Nicholas Yonge in England

Nicholas Yonge was an English singer and publisher He is most famous for publishing a collection of music called Musica transalpina in 

Music publishing was quite a new thing in those days Musica transalpina was a collection of Italian madrigals The Italian words of the madrigals were also translated into English Musica transalpina had 57 separate pieces by 18 Italian composers including Alfonso Ferrabosco and Luca Marenzio Ferrabosco was living in England at the time

The publication of this book had a huge influence on music in England It made madrigals very popular in England and during the next twenty years composers such as Thomas Morley John Wilbye and Thomas Weelkes composed a large number of English madrigals

In 1597 Yonge published a second book of Musica transalpina which was also very influential

The title Musica transalpina means music from across the Alps because the music came from Italy which was the other side of the Alps

A complex thing is something which is hard complicated or difficult to understand It is the opposite of simple Text that is complex can be made up of lots of simple sentences or phrases put together in a complex way This makes them harder to understand Complex things are usually associated with higher standards or levels

Laurasiatheria is a mammal group with species put together based on DNA analysis The name comes from the thinking that these mammals evolved on the supercontinent of Laurasia after it split from Gondwana when Pangaea broke up It includes these extant orders

The Mysticeti are one of the two suborders of the Cetacea They are often called baleen whales or whalebone whales or great whales Baleen whales have baleen plates for filtering food from water instead of having teeth This makes them different from the Odontoceti 

The difference is connected with feeding Baleen whales strain plankton out of the water whereas the toothed whales eat larger prey

The suborder contains four families and fourteen species

Baleen whales do not have teeth except as embryos Fossil adult baleen whales did have teeth but modern adults have only baleen The embryo teeth are replaced by baleen which look like a curtain of long plates hanging down from the top of the whales mouth Those plates might be 12 feet long and a foot or more wide Looking at them from the outside they look like straight knives hanging down but from the inside they are like a big toothbrush or comb Baleen is made of keratin a tissue also found in mammalian hair and nails

A baleen whale uses its baleen to eat In order to feed a baleen whale opens its mouth widely and scoops in dense shoals of plankton and other small prey together with a large volume of water 

The whale then partly shuts its mouth and presses its tongue against its upper jaw forcing the water to pass out sideways through the baleen thus sieving out the prey which it then swallows

Baleen whales are generally larger than toothed whales and females are larger than males This group includes the largest living animal species the Blue Whale

Baleen whales have two blowholes so they will have a V shaped blow

Although they are very heavy baleen whales are able to jump completely out of the water Humpback Whales are known for their jumping skills but other baleen whales also jump out from the water with their body or beat it loudly with their fins Nobody knows for sure why the whales do this It may be a type of communication

From the 11th to the late 20th centuries baleen whales were hunted for their oil and baleen Their oil can be made into margarine and cooking oils Baleen was used to stiffen corsets as parasol ribs and to crease paper

Termites are an order of social insects the Isoptera They are sometimes called white ants incorrectly because ants belong to the Order Hymenoptera 

They are eusocial animals as are ants and some bees and wasps Termites mostly feed on detritus mostly wood leaf litter soil or animal dung There are an estimated 4000 species About 10 are pests which can cause serious structural damage to buildings crops or plantation forests 

Termites are major detrivores in the subtropical and tropical regions Their recycling of wood and other plant matter is very important for ecology

A termite colony starts when winged termites swarm and mate After mating they fall to the ground and rip off their wings The female looks for a good place to start the colony and the male follows her Most termites nest underground their entire lives but termites in Africa and Australia actually build really big mound structures that look like little mountains and can be more than 20 feet tall

Termites live in colonies that at maturity hold from several hundred to several million individuals They are a prime example self organised systems which use swarm intelligence They use this cooperation to exploit food sources and environments which would not be available to any single insect acting alone A typical colony contains nymphs workers soldiers and reproductive individuals of both genders sometimes containing several egg laying queens

A Mantis is a type of insect They are usually known as praying mantids because of their prayer like stance

The group contains about 2300 species They occur in temperate and tropical habitats Most are in are in the family Mantidae and are called Mantids 

In Europe the name praying mantis refers to only a single species Mantis religiosa They are sometimes confused with phasmids 

The closest relatives of mantids are the orders Isoptera and Blattaria and these three groups together are ranked as the Superorder Dictyoptera

Mantids are notable for their hunting abilities They are exclusively predatory and their diet usually consists of living insects including flies and aphids Larger species have been known to prey on small lizards frogs birds snakes and even rodents 

Most mantids are ambush predators waiting for prey to stray too near The mantis then lashes out at remarkable speed Some ground and bark species however pursue their prey rather quickly 

Prey are caught and held securely with grasping spiked forelegs the first thoracic segment the prothorax is commonly elongated and flexibly articulated allowing for greater range of movement of the front limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile 

The articulation of the head is also remarkably flexible permitting nearly 300 degrees of movement in some species allowing for a great range of vision without having to move the remainder of the body As their hunting relies heavily on vision they are primarily diurnal but many species fly at night and can be found at lights

Mantids are masters of camouflage and most species make use of protective colouration to blend in with the foliage or substrate This helps to avoid predators themselves and to better snare their victims Various species have adapted to not only blend with the foliage but to mimic it appearing as either living or withered leaves sticks tree bark blades of grass flowers or even stones Some species in Africa and Australia are able to turn black after a molt following a fire in the region to blend in with the fire ravaged landscape 

Mantids bite but have no venom and are not dangerous to humans They are not chemically protected nearly any large predatory animal will eat a mantis if it is able to detect it

Amazing Grace is a well known Christian hymn The words were written in 1772 by Englishman John Newton The poem named Faiths Review and Expectation was where the song came from

 Amazing Grace

Amazing grace how sweet the sound 

That savd a wretch like me

I once was lost but now am found

Was blind but now I see

Twas grace that taught my heart to fear

And grace my fears relievd

How precious did that grace appear

The hour I first believd

Thro many dangers toils and snares

I have already come

Tis grace has brought me safe thus far

And grace will lead me home

The Lord has promisd good to me

His word my hope secures

He will my shield and portion be

As long as life endures

Yes when this flesh and heart shall fail

And mortal life shall cease

I shall possess within the veil

A life of joy and peace

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow

The sun forbear to shine

But God who calld me here below

Will be forever mine

Eusociality is a concept from biology that is used to describe the form of social organisation of animals The term eusocial was introduced in 1966 by Suzanne Batra EO Wilson gave it a more precise meaning At the start it was used for invertebrates only It should apply to animals with these features

There are other levels of social organisation as well

The most familiar examples are insects such as ants bees wasps and termites All of these are colonial animals which have queens for reproduction The animals that are workers or soldiers are usually sterile they cannot have offspring 

In 2009 there were only two known mammal species with this form of organisation the naked mole rat and the Damaraland mole rat 

Eusociality with biologically sterile individuals represents the most extreme form of kin altruism The analysis of eusociality played a key role in the development of theories in sociobiology

The phenomenon of reproductive specialization is found in various organisms It generally involves the production of sterile members of the species which carry out specialized tasks effectively caring for the reproductive members It most commonly manifests in the appearance of individuals within a group whose behavior is modified for group defense including self sacrifice

After Wilsons original definition other people have tried to change it They wanted it to also specify in what way and to what extent labour was divided A narrower definition specifies the requirement for irreversibly distinct behavioral groups or castes The newer definition excludes all social vertebrates because they do not have distinct castes that are different A broader definition allows for any temporary division of labor or non random distribution of reproductive success to constitute eusociality and some have accordingly argued that even humans may be considered eusocial Others believe that the hierarchical classification may not serve much purpose

Looking for food and defending the group are two activities that can benefit from being done by many animals together Despite this eusocial animals looked like a paradox even to Charles Darwin Evolution means that those animals that are better adapted to their environment have a better chance of passing on their genes 

In colonies of eusocial animals some animals are sterile They can not pass on their genes at all How can these animals evolve and persist Since they do not breed their fitness should be zero and any genes causing this condition should be eliminated from the population immediately In Origin of Species Darwin called this behavior the one special difficulty which at first appeared to me insuperable and actually fatal to my theory Darwin thought that the resolution to the paradox would lie in the close family relationship 

He could not say more at the time The first theories that could offer an explanation were the ones of kin selection and inclusive fitness Both rely on the discovery of how genes are inherited This discovery was made after Darwin had published On the Origin of Species

Early ideas on eusociality included suggestions that trophallaxis or food sharing was a basis for sociality Other theories include superorganism theory and parental manipulation theory The most widely accepted model to explain eusociality is based on WD Hamiltons idea of inclusive fitness

If the theory of inclusive fitness is applied ants will evolve eusociality more easily Haplodiploidy makes kin selection easier Sisters are more related to each other than to any offspring they might have WD Hamilton called this supersisters On average two supersisters have 75 percent of the same genes If they were to breed they would only share half of their genome with their offspring From the selfish genes point of view it is better to raise more sisters Even though workers often do not reproduce they are potentially passing on more of their genes by caring for sisters than they would by having their own offspring

This unusual situation where females may have greater fitness when they help rear siblings rather than producing offspring is often used to explain that eusociality evolved several times independently in the haplodiploid group Hymenoptera ants bees and wasps As of 2009 11 separate cases are known However Hymenoptera is a large group and the majority of hymenopterans are not social Furthermore highly developed eusociality also exists in non hymenopterans perhaps most prominently in termites Certain vertebrates have also been described as eusocial Most such cases involve organisms that display high levels of inbreeding such that colony members share more than half of their genes and therefore the same model is considered to apply to these species

Reeve and Holldobler have put forward a theory of a superorganism They elaborate this model further by also looking at competition and co operation between groups as well as within groups In their model an individuals inclusive fitness varies depending on how much it invests in within group competition versus between group competition and on its relatedness to the other group members In a hymenopteran colony with one breeder and many workers as described above the evolutionarily stable state is for each individual to invest entirely in helping the group This leads to a perfect superorganism This means that in this case eusociality is stable a result that agrees with Hamiltons findings They can show this result even without considering between group interactions However they further demonstrate that any group of relatives may show high superorganismness provided that there are many groups competing for the same resources This may favour eusociality or a degree of eusociality in non hymenopterans Indeed a non zero level of inter group co operation is predicted even if the group members are entirely unrelated as long as there is competition between groups

Theories of parental manipulation point out that the transition from solitary to eusocial appears to involve some stages where dominance interactions are required to suppress the reproductive tendencies of group members that is females are manipulated into acting as workers even if it is against their own self interest This model does not require that individuals are highly related though high relatedness will reduce expected levels of resistance to manipulation

Some hypotheses about how eusociality evolved in naked mole rats include inbreeding ecological factors such as the dependence on large tubers that are hard to locate and reach underground heat loss prevention and high dispersal costs In the mammalian cases eusociality is believed to arise from reproductive suppression where infertility in working females is only temporary and not geneticFactdateDecember 2007

Recently some species of gall making aphids and thrips were found to be eusocial with many separate origins of the state These species have extremely high relatedness among individuals due to their partially asexual mode of reproduction but the gall inhabiting behavior gives these species a defensible resource that sets them apart from related species with similar genetics In these groups therefore high relatedness alone does not lead to the evolution of social behavior but requires that groups occur in a restricted shared area

Damon Graham Devereux Hill OBE is a British former racing driver from England

He was the 1996 Formula One World Champion As the son of the late double Formula One world champion Graham Hill he is the only son of a world champion to win the title Despite the famous family name Hill had an uphill struggle to reach the ranks of F1

Damon Hill came to professional motorsports relatively late he began racing motorcycles in 1983 at the age of 23 The following year he won the 350 cc Clubmans cup at Brands Hatch In 1985 he moved on to four wheel single seater racing with Team Van Diemen in the Formula Ford championship before moving up into the UK Formula 3 championship in 1986 After three seasons in Formula 3 where he won four races Hill ascended another tier of open wheel racing by joining Mooncraft in the International Formula 3000 championship where although often competitive he never won a race 

Hill started his Formula One career in 1992 with the then uncompetitive Brabham team His debut race was at the British Grand Prix where he qualified on the back row He took the first of his 22 victories at the 1993 Hungarian Grand Prix for the Williams team the following year In 1994 he won the British Grand Prix a race his father had never won in his long and successful career During the mid 1990s Hill was Michael Schumachers main rival for the Formula One Drivers Championship finishing runner up in the Germans 1994 and 1995 title seasons The two had a series of controversial clashes on and off the track including the collision at the 1994 Australian Grand Prix that gave Schumacher his first title by a single point Hill took eight victories and the world championship in 1996 Despite this Williams decided in mid 1996 not to renew Hills contract for 1997 He went on to record the Jordan teams first ever win at the 1998 Belgian Grand Prix and came within a few miles of being the only driver to win a Grand Prix for the Arrows team and their Yamaha engine supplier at the 1997 Hungarian Grand Prix He retired from the sport at the end of the 1999 season after 122 races

In 2006 Hill became president of the British Racing Drivers Club succeeding Jackie Stewart

Motor Racing Developments Ltd commonly known as Brabham was a British company that built racing cars It also ran a racing team in Formula One It was founded in 1960 by two Australians driver Jack Brabham and designer Ron Tauranac The team won four drivers and two constructors world championships in its 30 year Formula One history As of 2008 Jack Brabhams 1966 drivers championship remains the only victory by a car bearing the drivers own name

Brabham was the worlds largest manufacturer of customer open wheel racing cars in the 1960s and had built more than 500 cars by 1970 During this period teams using Brabham cars won championships in Formula Two and Formula Three and competed in the Indianapolis 500 In the 1970s and 1980s Brabham introduced innovations such as the controversial but successful fan car in race refuelling carbon brakes and hydropneumatic suspension The team won two more Formula One drivers championships in the 1980s with Brazilian Nelson Piquet and became the first to win a drivers championship with a turbocharged car

British businessman Bernie Ecclestone owned Brabham during most of the 1970s and 1980s and later become responsible for administrating the commercial aspects of Formula One Ecclestone sold the team in 1988 Its last owner was the Middlebridge Group a Japanese engineering firm Midway through the 1992 season the team collapsed financially as Middlebridge was unable to make repayments against loans provided by Landhurst Leasing The case was investigated by the UK Serious Fraud Office

Afrotheria is a group of mammals containing the golden moles elephant shrews tenrecs aardvarks hyraxes elephants and manatees Scientists made this group based on DNA analyses Experiments in the 1990s have named Afrotheria as one of four major groups in the group Eutheria Afrotheria means African animals afro for Africa and theria for animals Many animals in the group seem to be at a high risk of extinction If the scientists are correct in grouping the animals in afrotheria together this would be a huge loss of different animals in the same group 

Some scientists do not agree with grouping the animals in afrotheria together 

Afrotheria is a division of the infraclass Eutheria or Placentalia and groups together six living orders of mammals

Kimi Matias Rikknen is a race car driver currently driving for Scuderia Ferrari He is the 2007 Formula One World Drivers Champion

Rikknen entered Formula One as a regular driver for Sauber Petronas in 2001 Having previously only raced in very junior open wheel categories he was given his Super Licence from the Fdration Internationale de lAutomobile after a performance delivery promise from his team boss Peter Sauber He joined McLaren Mercedes in 2002 and became a title contender by finishing runner up in the 2003 and 2005 championships to Michael Schumacher and Fernando Alonso respectively

Switching to Ferrari in 2007 Rikknen became the highest paid driver in the sport and secured his first Formula One World Drivers Championship beating McLaren drivers Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso by one point

Rikknen is very calm cool and calculating in his race strategyprompting the nickname Iceman which is subtly written on the side of his current helmet design His other nicknames include Kimppa Rikk and Kimster

Rikknen joined the ranks of former F1 drivers who have moved to NASCAR in 2011 His first race was the Camping World Truck Series on May 20 at the Charlotte Motor Speedway in Charlotte North Carolina He finished in 15th place on the lead lap He hopes to to work his way up to the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series

Rikknens second NASCAR race was also at Charlotte He raced in the Nationwide Series He received a penalty for speeding on pit lane and finished in 27th place After the race he returned to Europe to compete in some more rally races Rikknen said his plans are to see what happens

La Fdration Internationale de lAutomobile commonly referred to as the FIA is a non profit association established as the Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus on June 20 1904 to represent the interests of motoring organisations and motor car users To the general public the FIA is mostly known as the governing body for motor racing events 

Headquartered at 8 Place de la Concorde Paris the FIA consists of 213 national member organisations in 125 countries worldwide Its current president is Max Mosley 

As is the case with footballs FIFA the FIA is generally known by its French name and acronym even in English speaking countries but is occasionally rendered as International Automobile Federation

Presociality is a phenomenon in which animals exhibit more than just sexual interactions with members of the same species however they fall short of qualifying as eusocial That is presocial animals can display communal living cooperative care of young or primitive reproductive division of labor but they do not display all of the three essential traits of eusocial animals those being 

Presocial behavior is much more common in the animal kingdom than complete eusociality Examples include canines that live in packs numerous insects especially hymenoptera humans many birds chimpanzees and many other animals that display social behavior

Some sociobiologists further categorize types of presociality

The path to each of these stages of sociality is highly varied between different groups of animals Sociality itself can be seemingly contrary to the theory of Darwinian evolution Darwin saw the phenomenon as a serious challenge for his theory to overcome However modern sociobiology has been able to explain many cases of social behavior 

Among the Vespidae it is thought that the pressures of predators and parasites selected subsocial behavior that is when the mother wasp stays in her brood cell to watch over her larva it becomes less likely that parasites will be successful in preying on the nest Other pressures can force the evolution of presociality A lack of resources available to pack wolves makes it possible to raise only one litter even with the aid of the pack This forces reproduction to be suppressed in all but the alpha male and female this way the non reproducing members of the pack can focus all of their care on one litter rather than several unsuccessful ones

The Togo Mouse also known as Bttners African Forest Mouse or the Groove toothed Forest Mouse is a unique muroid rodent It is known from only two specimens which were taken near the type locality of Bismarckburg near Yege Togo in 1890

The entirety of known material for this species consists of a single poor quality dry skin a fluid preserved animal and a cranium and mandible The cranium and mandible are from different animals The material is deposited in the Zoologisches Museum of Humboldt University in Berlin Germany

The head and body length is 118 mm with a tail of 37 mm This tail is unusually short relative to the body length and is considered an important diagnostic feature The animal is dark to grey brown above and pale grey brown below Ears are small and hairy Feet are also somewhat hairy The tail may be naked or slightly haired 

Incisors are shallowly grooved The snout is long and wide interorbital width broad and zygomatic plate large 

Based upon skull morphology the Togo Mouse is presumed to be insectivorous Very little is known about the habits of this unusual mouse

Leimacomys has been transferred back and forth between the Dendromurinae and the Murinae since its discovery It most closely resembles Lophuromys which has been transferred to a newly erected Deomyinae on the basis of molecular data The association with Lophuromys is thought to be due to convergent evolution due to a similar diet Tooth characters resemble dendromurines Mystromys or basal gerbils Denys et al generated a phylogeny that suggested with limited support that Leimacomys is a sister taxon to the Gerbillinae

Musser and Carleton chose to erect a new subfamily Leimacomyinae to house this species They placed it in the family Muridae due to its potential connection to either the Gerbillinae or Deomyinae but emphasized that a broad phylogenetic study including Leimacomys and a host of nesomyids and murids is needed to determine its appropriate position

The Togo Mouse is considered to be either critically endangered or extinct depending on the authority Schlitter classified it as extinct because subsequent surveys to the area failed to recover it Grubb et al noted that these surveys inadequately sampled appropriate habitat in Togo and neighboring Ghana and they were reluctant to declare the species extinct Musser and Carleton emphasized that insectivorous muroids as a group have proven difficult to capture and that intense surveys of high elevation forest in this region are required to determine if it still persists

The IUCN currently describes the Togo Mouse as data deficient

The family Chinchillidae contains the chinchillas viscachas and their fossil relatives They are restricted to southern and western South America Often they can be found in the Andes They are large rodents weighing from 800 grams to 8 kilograms with strong hind legs and large ears All species have thick soft fur which is considered valuable in some species

There are three extant and three fossil genera currently recognized

Suborder Myomorpha has 1137 species of mouse like rodents almost a quarter of all mammals mice rats gerbils hamsters lemmings and voles are in the group They are grouped according to how the jaw looks like and how the molar teeth look like They are very good at biting and chewing Myomorphs are found all around the world except Antarctica in almost all land places They are usually animals who are more active at night and they are seed eaters

Most myomorph species belong to superfamily Muroidea

Mouse like hamsters are a group of small rodents found in Syria Azerbaijan Iran Turkmenistan Afghanistan and Pakistan They are found in rocky and slightly high areas in desert regions

The mouse like hamsters are not real hamsters although they look like hamsters They were once thought to be hamsters based on the shape of their teeth but they do not have the cheek pouches and short tail of the true hamsters All animals in this genus were part of the same species before Calomyscus bailwardi but they are now separate species because they have big differences in chromosome number skull length and weight and other differences

In Europe species of Calomyscus can be kept as a pet They are called Calomyscus bailwardi mystax or Calomyscus bailwardi Only special people sell them not pet shops so they are usually only people who really like mice will buy them

Mouse like hamsters live the longest of all the mouse species They have been recorded as living 9 years 3 months and 18 days in captivity They regularly live over 4 years in captivity The species which lives the second longest in the muroids lives 7 years 8 months which is the Canyon Mouse Peromyscus crinitus 

Nesomyidae is a family of African rodents in the large and complicated superfamily Muroidea It includes many subfamilies which all live in Africa Malagasy rats and mice climbing mice African rock mice swamp mice pouched rats and the white tailed rat are in this family

Nesomyids are small to medium rodents and the largest is the size of a rat They may look like mice rats voles or hamsters depending on the species and subfamily They can either eat plant and meat totally or insects totally Their habits are also different with some species climbing trees and others digging holes in the ground to hide They can give birth to the most four babies after being in the mothers womb for about six weeks

Many of these animals were once thought to be related to other groups of muroid rodents but this African based group has been confirmed to be different from the other muroids based on genetic studies Still all members of the Nesomyidae are placed in the family Muridae along with all other members of the Muroidea

The Nesomyids are classified in 5 subfamilies 22 genera and 55 species

Manisa is a city in the western Turkey in Asia Minor

The Cricetidae are a family of rodents in the large and complicated superfamily Muroidea It includes true hamsters voles lemmings and New World rats and mice With almost 600 species it is the second largest family of mammals and has animals in it in the New World Asia and Europe

The cricetids are small mammals ranging from just 5 to 8 cm and 7 grams in weight in the New World Pygmy Mouse up to 41 to 62 cm and 1100 grams in the Muskrat How long the tail is depends on how big the body is and the tails can be either with hair or a little hair Most species have brown fur with a white colored underbelly but there are also many other patterns especially in the cricetine and arvicoline subfamilies

Like the Old World Mice cricetids live in a wide range of habitats in the high Arctic to tropical rainforests and hot deserts Some are good at climbing with long balancing tails and other way to help them to climb while others can swim with webbed feet and small external ears Yet others are burrowing animals or ground dwellers which live in the ground

Their diet is also variable with herbivorous omnivorous and insectivorous species known They all have large biting and chewing incisors separated from grinding molar teeth by a gap or diastema There can be a lot of these animals in a very short time because the mother gives birth to them after 15 to 50 days and they have a lot of babies at one time The young are usually born blind hairless and helpless

The cricetids are thus classified to contain one prehistoric and 5 living subfamilies around 112 living genera and approximately 580 living species

In philosophy phenomenology is a way of thinking about ourselves Instead of asking about what we really are it focuses on phenomena These are experiences that we get from the senses  what we see taste smell touch hear and feel Phenomenology does not ask if what we are seeing is actually there It also does not ask if we are missing something or if we have all the facts Instead phenomenologists believe we should look at the world just as it appears to us 

Martin Heidegger a famous phenomenologist said that philosophers should be looking at how we live in our average everydayness In his book Being and Time he uses many examples of how people live in their normal lives Jean Paul Sartre did the same in his book Being and Nothingness For example he writes about meeting a friend at a cafe However the friend named Pierre never shows up Sartre writes that he can feel the absence of Pierre in the cafe Because of this he says that non Pierre is something that exists at least for him It exists because he can feel it

History 

The river was first called the Hume River after it was discovered by European explorers Hamilton Hume and William Hovell in November 1824 Explorer Charles Sturt renamed the river in January 1830 after a British politician Sir George Murray In 1852 the government offered a bonus of 8000 for the first paddlesteamer to reach Echuca This was achieved by both William Randell and Francis Cadell

A buffer solution is chemical solution which resists change to its pH or acidity

It is a solution in water of a mixture of a weak acid or base and its salt The pH of the solution changes very little when a small amount of strong acid or base is added to it Buffer solutions are used as a means of keeping pH at a nearly constant value in a wide variety of chemical applications Many life forms have a relatively small pH range an example of a buffer solution is blood

Buffer solutions may be of two types acidic and basic

If you add acid to the solution the concentration of H ions will increase to keep equilibrium a small number of ions will be combine If you add base the concentration of H ion will reduce and so a some amount of salt will break into ions and maintain the pH

Hamilton Hume was the first Australian born explorer

Hume was born near Parramatta a town close to Sydney His father was Andrew Hamilton Hume who came to Australia in 1790 in charge of convicts and later became a farmer

At 17 he began exploring the Sydney area and went as far as Berrima On these journeys Hume learned how to live safely in the bush In March 1817 he went on a journey with James Meehan the deputy surveyor general and discovered Lake Bathurst and the Goulburn Plains Later he went with John Oxley and Meehan to Jervis Bay and in 1822 was with a group which sailed in a boat down the east coast of New South Wales looking for rivers

On October 2 1824 Hume and William Hovell left Sydney to try and get to Spencers Gulf in South Australia The explorers took six servants five bullocks three horses and two carts Much of the journey was over rough mountain country with many rivers to get across On November 16 they found a fine river which they called the Hume This river was later renamed the Murray River They made a boat to get across the river near the present site of Albury After a journey of 11 weeks on December 16 1824 they reached Corio Bay Victoria near the present site of Geelong Hovell made an error in his navigation and they believed that they were on the shore of Western Port Bay The journey back was made on path more to the west the land was more level and they were back only 5 weeks later They ran out of food before the end of the journey and the whole group was very very tired 

Hume and Hovell received grants of convert1200acreha0lkonabbron of land as a reward Hume had to sell his land to pay for the cost of the journey This journey discovered the overland path between Sydney and Melbourne

In November 1828 Hume journeyed with Charles Sturt into western New South Wales where they discovered the Darling River Hume was able to talk with some aborigines who agreed to help them on the journey There was a long drought and it was very hard to find water It was only Humes good bushmanship saved the group

As a reward Governor Ralph Darling gave Hume convert1280acreha0lkonabbron of land at Yass Plains where he lived with his wife Elizabeth Dight and his nephew In December 1853 a speech Hovell made at Geelong led to an argument between the men This argument was over who had been the leader of the expedition and had Hume thought Corio Bay was Westernport Bay There were many letters and books written about the argument Governor Ralph Darling had always said Hume was the leader and Humes own letters at the time show he agreed with Hovells navigation mistake

Hume later worked as a magistrate until his death at Yass on 19 April 1873 He is buried in the Yass Cemetery

The Umayyad Empire is the sixth largest empire in history It was ruled by the Umayyad Dynasty The name of this dynasty comes from Umayya ibn Abd Shams the great grandfather of the first Umayyad caliph It was the first dynasty of the Muslim Caliphate Damascus was the capital 660750 

According to tradition the Umayyad family and the Islamic Prophet Muhammad both have a common ancestor Abd Manaf ibn Qusai Muhammad descended from Abd Munaf via his son Hashim the Umayyads descended from Abd Munaf via a different son Abd Shams The two families are therefore considered to be different clans of the same tribe

The Umayyads and the Hashimites were bitter rivals The rivalry came from the initial opposition of Abu Sufyan ibn Harb the grandson of Umayya to Muhammad and to Islam He tried to get rid of the new religion by waging a series of battles But eventually he accepted Islam as did his son and the two provided much needed political and diplomatic skills for the management of the quickly expanding Islamic empire

The origins of Umayyad rule date back to the assassination of Uthman in 656 At this time Ali a member of the Hashim clan and a cousin of Prophet Muhammad became the caliph He soon met with resistance from several factions and moved his capital from Medina to Kufa The resulting conflict which lasted from 656 until 661 is known as the First Fitna 

Ali was first opposed by an alliance led by Aisha the widow of Muhammad and Talhah and Al Zubayr two of the Companions of the Prophet The two sides clashed at the Battle of the Camel in 656 where Ali won a decisive victory

When Ali was assassinated in 661 Muawiyah marched to Kufa There he persuaded a number of Alis supporters to accept him as caliph instead of Alis son Hasan Then he moved the capital of the caliphate to Damascus Syria would remain the base of Umayyad power until the end of the dynasty

The 2004 playoffs were considered to be wide open with no clear favourite All of the top teams had weaknesses Tampa Bay and Boston were both young teams with no history of recent postseason success Detroit Ottawa Colorado and Philadelphia all had major questions in goal New Jersey was marred by injuries to Scott Stevens and Brian Rafalski while Vancouver was missing the suspended Todd Bertuzzi

The first round Eastern Conference matchups were notable for the number of heated rivalries The Ottawa Senators met the Toronto Maple Leafs for the fourth time in five years in the always passion filled Battle of Ontario The Boston Bruins and Montreal Canadiens met in a resumption of the most common of all NHL playoff series and one which the Canadiens have thoroughly dominated including an upset win two years prior The Philadelphia Flyers also played a hated division rival in the New Jersey Devils The only non rivalry was the Tampa Bay New York Islanders series

The West saw the resumption of the Vancouver Calgary rivalry which had been somewhat dormant as the Flames made the playoffs for the first time since 1996 In a less passionate but still interesting matchup Detroit played division rival Nashville in Nashvilles first ever franchise visit to the playoffs San Jose met the St Louis Blues while the always difficult four five matchup saw Colorado and Dallas meet

The Calgary Flames a sixth seed defeated three straight division champions the Canucks the Red Wings and the Sharks to become the first Canadian team to reach the Stanley Cup Finals in ten years since the Canucks lost to the Rangers in the Finals in 1994 They faced the Tampa Bay Lightning who defeated the Islanders in five swept the Canadiens and defeated the Flyers in seven games

The Flames and the Lightning battled hard in the Stanley Cup Finals eventually pushing the series to seven games By game 5 the Flames took the 32 series lead back to Calgary and in game six a puck appeared to have gone into the net which would have made the game 32 but the goal light did not go on the referee did not signal that a goal had been scored and play went on no goal counted Extensive replays showed the play was inconclusive The Lightning would win the game in double overtime and go on to win the Stanley Cup with a 21 win in game seven with two goals from Ruslan Fedotenko Brad Richards with a team high 25 points in the playoffs was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy

The International Opium Convention was the first drug control treaty It was signed at The Hague in The Netherlands on January 23 1912 The United States organised a conference between 13 countries called the International Opium Commission in 1909 in Shanghai China because people complained more and more about opium trade The treaty was signed by Germany the United States China France the United Kingdom Italy Japan The Netherlands Persia Portugal Russia and Siam The Convention said that The contracting Powers shall use their best endeavours to control or to cause to be controlled all persons manufacturing importing selling distributing and exporting morphine cocaine and their respective salts as well as the buildings in which these persons carry such an industry or trade

The Convention was implemented in 1915 by the United States Netherlands China Honduras and Norway It went into force around the world in 1919 when it became part of the Treaty of Versailles

A modified International Opium Convention was signed on February 19 1925 which started on September 25 1928 It introduced control system to be looked after by a Permanent Central Opium Board part of the League of Nations Egypt with support from China and United States recommended that a ban on hashish be added to the Convention and a sub committee proposed the following text The use of Indian hemp and the preparations derived therefrom may only be authorized for medical and scientific purposes The raw resin however which is extracted from the female tops of the cannabis sativa L together with the various preparations of which it forms the basis not being at present utilized for medical purposes and only being susceptible of utilisation for harmful purposes in the same manner as other narcotics may not be produced sold traded in etc under any circumstances whatsoever India and other countries did not agree to this language saying social and religious customs and that wild growing cannabis plants being available in many places that would make it difficult to enforce so this never made it into the final treaty A compromise was made that banned the export of Indian hemp to countries that have banned its use Importing countries were made to issue certificates approving the import and stating that the shipment was required exclusively for medical or scientific purposes It also required Parties to exercise an effective control of such a nature as to prevent the illicit international traffic in Indian hemp and especially in the resin These restrictions still made it easy for countries to allow production internal trade and use of cannabis for recreational purposes

Until 1995 Bhimber was a sub division of Mirpur District In 1996 the tehsil of Bhimber was removed from Mirpur and made into a separate district

The district is bounded by Mirpur District to the northwest and Punjab province in the west and south It also shares borders with Indian Kashmir to the east

The total area of the district is 1516 square kilometres and is divided into three tehsils

Kotli is one of the eight districts of Azad Kashmir Pakistan Kotli is the capital city of the district Kotli used to be a small town between Mirpur and Muzaffarabad but has recently grown in size

There are two theories about the origin of the name Kotli One is that in ancient times Prince Raja Shahswar Khan built a small house here and called it Kot which became Kotli Another theory is that the name is derived from the Sanskrit word Kotli which means to reside or to live in At one time the area was inhabited by the Mangran and Solhan peoples and was called Kotli Solwhan

Mirpur District is a district in Pakistans Azad Kashmir Liberated Territory The district is named after the main city  Mirpur The District of Mirpur comprises mostly plain and some hilly areas Its hot and dry climate and other geographical conditions closely resemble those of Jhelum and Gujrat the adjoining Districts of Pakistan

Mirpur District is now located in the south west of the Kashmir region  it was part of the punjab until 1846Azad Kashmir is administered by Pakistan from Islamabad Azad Kashmir has been considered politically constitutionally and geographically as part of a separate state ie Indian Occupied Kashmir This state is a disputed territory and has been controlled by both Pakistan and India since their independence 14 15th August 1947 respectively Azad Kashmir is under the indirect control of Pakistan however its defence foreign policy and currency are under the direct control of Pakistan

Also its chairman chief executive is always the President of Pakistan Hence the rest of members are Azad Kashmirs own Prime Minister and President and some ministers The Central Board of Revenue is responsible for tax affairs of rest of all Pakistani territory ie all four provinces and the capital Islamabad

As such they are today the major foreign exchange earning resource for Pakistan Around 50000 people were moved from this district in the mid sixties to make way for the construction of Mangla Dam but corrupt handling of funds meant long drawn out delays in completing the project Most of these people settled in new Mirpur whilst some moved elsewhere in Pakistan or to the UK

The Invasion was a wrestling storyline in the World Wrestling Federation that began after the WWF bought World Championship Wrestling It involved the WCW wrestlers invading WWF television to try to take over the WWF 

The idea of a match showing the top 2 shows of the Monday Night Wars was considered to be a dream match show in the eyes of many fans because it let fans to see which show would be superior The storyline began when Vince McMahons son Shane McMahon said on RAW that he bought WCW This led to many appearances of WCW wrestlers during RAW and SmackDown after WrestleMania X Seven 

In June 2001 the storyline got more intense as more WWF storylines ended to make room for the central Invasion storyline WCW and Extreme Championship Wrestling merged to make The Alliance and challenged the WWFs control over the wrestling industry An Inaugural Brawl took place at the WWF Invasion pay per view where Stone Cold Steve Austin defected and joined the Alliance Many inter promotional matches occurred after the Invasion between The Alliance and the WWF leading up to the climax of the angle at Survivor Series 2001 when Team WWF defeated Team Alliance in a Winner Take All match

A very large storyline that went for 5 months from June 2001 to November 2001 the storyline has been heavily criticized

During the Monday Night Wars the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling the top 2 North American wrestling shows competed for ratings Through developments such as the nWo and the Montreal Screwjob fans compared the two promotions and the Internet wrestling community was full of arguments as to which of the two was the best

Among other things however mismanagement within WCW eventually led WCW to a downward spiral from which it never recovered The Monday Night Wars came to an end on March 23 2001 when the WWF bought WCW for what was considered to be a bargain price

The final night of the Monday Night Wars occurred on March 26 2001 RAW primarily focused on the major storylines heading into WrestleMania X Seven while Nitro held their final episode with a Night Of Champions Vince McMahon opened up Nitro and announced a simulcast later that night to address the future of WCW Throughout RAW McMahon publicly named several WCW wrestlers who would not be retained After Sting defeated Ric Flair in WCWs final match the simulcast began McMahon talked about the buyout of WCW and toyed with the idea of making WCW into a huge media conglomerate much like the WWF He asked the crowd who he should keep under his belt by mentioning names of WCW wrestlers and asking for a reaction Lex Luger received a negative reaction from fans and Hulk Hogan Buff Bagwell Booker T Scott Steiner Sting and Goldberg received positive reactions Vince then proceeded to fire them all however to the cheers of the RAW crowd and the jeers of the Nitro crowd McMahon then announced that he would sign the contract and make the purchase official at WrestleMania Shane McMahon however appeared on Nitro and announced that he had signed the contract and purchased WCW out from under his fathers nose planting the seed for what was considered a lucrative future storyline opportunity The Invasion did not begin immediately afterwards as the WWF was preparing for WrestleMania X Seven the years largest show mere days away

The WWF had effectively doubled the size of its roster through its purchase of WCW and as a result there was not enough screen time for everyone The original plan was to find a time slot on TNN to continue running WCW as a separate entity Polls were even put up on WWFcom and WCWcom to decide the name of the new show These plans fell through when no TV station would touch WCW because of its reputation for losing money The WWF eventually carried out a brand extension effectively reviving WCW under its own auspices and running two separate promotions each with one of the WWFs two existing televised shows RAW and SmackDown

As part of its plans Lance Storm became the first WCW wrestler to appear on WWF programming by running in during a match on the May 28 episode of RAW while a match was being held At King of the Ring 2001 on June 24 then WCW wrestler Booker T interfered during the Triple Threat Main Event match for the WWF Championship and almost cost Stone Cold Steve Austin the title Also Austin suffered fractured bones in his hand from the side slam he took from Booker into an announce table The next night a confrontation occurred between WCW owner Shane McMahon and WWF owner Vince McMahon While Vince was in the ring Booker T came from behind to deliver his trademark scissor kick to Vince The WWF roster ran to the ring to the aid of Vince but Booker T and Shane McMahon escaped through the crowd This incident marked the official start of the Invasion storyline to which RAW announcer Jim Ross announced The battle lines have been drawn

The WWF eventually began to recognize WCW and tested the idea of a brand extension by giving WCW the final twenty minutes of RAW with Scott Hudson and Arn Anderson doing announcing duties in place of Jim Ross and Paul Heyman During a match between Buff Bagwell and Booker T for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship WWF wrestlers Kurt Angle and WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin interfered in revenge by beating Booker T up with Bagwell joining Angle and Austin by attacking Booker T A

On the July 9 episode on RAW Kane was scheduled to go into a handicapped match against Mike Awesome and Lance Storm Chris Jericho came out and offered to be Kanes partner thus turning it into a tag team match Near the end of the match Jericho applied the Walls of Jericho on Lance Storm As the move was being applied however Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer ran through the audience and into the ring and started to beat on Kane and Jericho In response WWF wrestlers consisting of The Dudley Boyz Tazz Justin Credible Rhyno and Raven ran to the ring After a brief stand off the WWF group turned around and attacked Kane and Jericho This prompted Paul Heyman to leave the announce table and enter the ring After high fiving the wrestlers he announced that ECW has been brought into the Invasion Heyman talked about how tired he was sitting beside Jim Ross and discussing WCW vs WWF stating that he felt that everyone had forgotten about ECW and announced This Invasion just got taken to the extreme

Later during the night Shane and Vince McMahon bumped into each other backstage Shane told his father that ECW needed to be taken care of and pointed out that there were 10 ECW wrestlers under Heymans belt He suggested that he would take five of his WCW wrestlers and have them team up with five of Vince McMahons WWF wrestlers later that night to take out ECW Vince agreed but insisted that WCW would eventually meet its demise when all was said and done

At the end of the night the WCW wrestlers came into the ring accompanied by Shane McMahon The WWF wrestlers then came into the ring and before ECW entered the WCW and WWF wrestlers started to brawl The WWF wrestlers cleared the ring but then were stormed by the ECW wrestlers and taken out After this WCWs men came into the ring and high fived the ECW men Paul Heyman and Shane McMahon then hugged and started to dismantle the WWF wrestlers Vince McMahon stunned came out and asked what was going on Shane McMahon responded that he was responsible for all the events that just transpired and announced that ECW and WCW merged to form The Alliance He then announced that the new owner of ECW was Stephanie McMahon

At InVasion the Inaugural Brawl took place between Team WCWECW and Team WWF The WWF consisted of Stone Cold Steve Austin Kurt Angle Chris Jericho Kane and the Undertaker who all wrestled against the team of DDP Booker T Rhyno and the Dudley Boys Near the end of the match all of the wrestlers were outside of the ring except Booker T and Angle Kurt Angle applied the ankle lock on Booker T who tapped out but no referee was there to witness it Stone Cold then dragged a referee into the ring but then kicked Kurt Angle in the face Stunned him and placed Booker T on top of Kurt Angle and told the referee to count Team WCWECW won the match due to Stone Colds actions

Shane McMahon on the July 26 edition of SmackDown extended an invitation to The Rock who had not been seen since the RAW following WrestleMania X Seven to the Alliance Also that night Kurt Angle challenged Booker T to a WCW World Heavyweight Championship match which Booker T accepted The WWF gained momentum when Angle beat Booker T with an ankle lock taking the WCW Championship away from the Alliance Angles title run proved to be short lived as Booker T won it back on the July 30 episode of RAW

On that same RAW The Rock returned for the first time since his suspension on the April 2 edition of RAW Shane and Vince McMahon were in the ring that night and each tried to convince The Rock to join their respective side Shane McMahon took the liberty of reminding The Rock of how Vince screwed him out of the WWF Championship earlier that year at WrestleMania and also in a steel cage match the day after WrestleMania Vince McMahon replied that Shane was somewhat accurate in his accusations but ceded that it was wrong for him to back Stone Cold as he was a rattlesnake that he should have known would eventually bite him He promised to The Rock that he had no intention of screwing him if he returned to the WWF but also ceded that he could not promise that he never would if it was good for business he said then he just might do it He told The Rock that he was at least being honest with him and pleaded for The Rock to trust himself stating that his future was with the fans and the WWF The Rock however Rock Bottomed Vince McMahon and proceeded to shake Shanes hand but he then proceeded to Rock Bottom him as well 

His return led to a WCW Title match between The Rock and Booker T at SummerSlam 2001 which The Rock won marking the second time the WCW Championship belt changed sides to the WWF At that same pay per view Austin retained his WWF Championship against Angle after Angle won by disqualification 

The following RAW and SmackDown showings featured primarily inter promotional matches between the two companies Austin stole Kurt Angles medals during one of the shows and on the August 30 edition of SmackDown tied them to a cinder block and threw them in a river The following RAW Debra and Stephanie bought a new truck for Stone Cold but Angle came up from behind and nailed Austin in the back of the head with a pipe He put a cinder block and rope in the truck put Austin in it and drove away on the truck He threatened to throw Stone Cold into a river if he did not get a title shot Austin complied and gave him a shot at the upcoming pay per view Unforgiven Angle said however that Austin was still going into the water but instead simply embarrassed Austin by throwing him into a kiddie pool

The WWF gained even more momentum at Unforgiven as The Rock retained the WCW Championship against Booker T and Kurt Angle made Austin submit to the ankle lock winning the WWF Championship from Stone Cold putting both belts into the hands of the WWF

There were several inter promotional matches after Unforgiven Furthermore a crucial plot point formed when on the October 8 airing of RAW Jericho and The Rock teamed up against Shane McMahon and Rob Van Dam Jerichos face was drenched in blood and with a steel chair in his hand accidentally nailed The Rock when he was trying to hit Shane McMahon This caused a stir backstage later on in the night when The Rock checked to make sure Jericho who was being treated by EMTs was in good condition but stated that Jericho made a big mistake in the match Jericho irritated countered that everyone makes mistakes including The Rock The Rock responded that everyone should own up to their mistakes but was more concerned with Jerichos condition As he went to leave the room Jericho made a comment to the EMT wondering what the hell The Rock wanted for him The Rock overheard this walked back and asked Jericho to repeat himself Jericho did just that and The Rock countered that his mistake actually cost them the match Jericho countered that he maybe should have hit The Rock instead with a chair on purpose and proceeded to taunt The Rock by stating that he should knock the Peoples Eyebrow off of The Rocks face The Rock provoked Jericho to do just that and a brawl ensued

Also that night Stone Cold and Kurt Angle faced off for the WWF Championship and William Regal who sat at ringside to ensure a fair match would take place hit Kurt Angle with the championship thereby backstabbing the WWF and costing Angle the title

The feud between Jericho and The Rock built up to a match at No Mercy on October 21 where Jericho beat the Rock to win the WCW Championship and Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated Angle and Rob Van Dam to retain his WWF Championship

On the October 29 edition of RAW Shane McMahon told his father Vince McMahon that a member of the WWF would jump ship to the Alliance that night Later that same night Kurt Angle backstabbed the WWF by hitting Jericho The Rock Undertaker and Kane with steel chairs On the November 1 edition of SmackDown Angle who originally led the WWF wrestlers explained that he represented what is great about America  he was a winner and his defection came from his decision to fight along the winning side That side included Stone Cold a man Kurt Angle claimed knew how to win

On the November 5 airing of RAW Vince McMahon countered Kurt Angles defection by stating that a member of Team Alliance would defect during a match at the upcoming Survivor Series Stone Cold came out to confront Vince about it and Vince stated that Stone Cold would be the one to defect Because of this announcement many Alliance members began to distrust Stone Cold looking at him with suspicious eyes to which Stone Cold denied the charges and called Vince a liar Stone Cold went on to interrogate members of Team Alliance questioning Booker T and sitting Rob Van Dam down in a room with a light shining on him

All of this led to a Winner Take All match at Survivor Series 2001 which pitted Team WWF against Team Alliance The final three men in the match were The Rock and Jericho vs Austin Jericho was eliminated and to continue the feud between the two men attacked the Rock even though Jerichos future was on the line if The Rock lost The Rock and Austin continued to battle it out and the referee was knocked down in the match Austin stunned the Rock and pinned him but there was no referee to count it Austin approached the downed referee to try to revive him As this was occurring Angle ran to the ring picked up the WWF championship belt and nailed Austin with it revealing himself to be the defector to which McMahon was referring the entire time The Rock followed this with a Rock Bottom and a pin on Austin to which the referee woke up and counted Austin down to three Team WWF prevailed thus ending the storyline

After The Alliance was disbanded the WCW World Heavyweight Championship would be simply renamed the World Championship and later unified with the WWF Championship to form the WWF Undisputed Championship The Undisputed Championship was originally represented with both the original WWF and WCW title belts as the champion would carry both belts around until being replaced with a single belt At the beginning of the WWE Brand Extension the champion would appear on both RAW and SmackDown until then champion Brock Lesnar took the title to Smackdown Eric Bischoff would reward Triple H with the former WCW championship belt as he was the last person to have it renaming it the World Heavyweight Championship The Undisputed Championship would be renamed the WWE Championship as having two world titles contradicted the term undisputed 

Another WCW championship the WCW Cruiserweight Championship was rebranded as a WWE title and replaced the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship as the WWE Cruiserweight Championship Additionally the WCW United States Championship was revived in 2003 as a SmackDown exclusive title thus becoming the WWE United States Championship

Although the WCW brand effectively died once and for all following the end of this storyline ECW was temporarily revived by WWE in 2005 for the purposes of a special reunion show ECW One Night Stand held on June 12 2005 The build up to this one shot event featured former ECW talent putting over the virtues of the brand versus the WWE product and appearances by several former ECW wrestlers not under contract to WWE In 2006 it was announced that WWE would be reviving ECW as its third brand The second One Night Stand held on June 11 2006 led to the official debut of the new ECW the following Tuesday

Test won the Immunity Battle Royal which granted him immunity from being fired for an entire year beginning a storyline in which he would bully other wrestlers simply because he could Every Alliance member who held championships were also immune from being fired such as Christian the Dudley Boyz and Rob Van Dam William Regal got his job back by being the first to join Vince McMahons infamous Kiss My Ass Club The remaining Alliance members would associate themselves with Vince who immediately turned heel against Austin who immediately turned face Kurt Angle remained a heel despite being the one responsible for the end of the Alliance It was during this storyline that Stone Cold Steve Austin coined the What catchphrase which fans continue to chant to this day Ric Flair would make a return and become the kayfabe co owner of the WWE with Vince

The Invasion angle was a large storyline that spanned for almost half of 2001 and brought about financial success for the WWF such as the InVasion pay per view being one of the highest non major event buyrates in the history of pay per views However the Invasion storyline has come under criticism by wrestling fans and wrestling media with the storyline being called a flop Other media refer to the storyline as one of the most poorly handled ego filled storylines in wrestling history The Invasion storyline was awarded the 2001 Gooker Award by WrestleCrap for worst gimmick storyline or event in wrestling

Throughout the storyline many inter promotional matches had WWF wrestlers winning over WCWECW wrestlers usually cleanly In contrast most of the Alliances wins were due to interference or disqualification For example it took Tazz assisting Raven at InVasion for Raven to beat William Regal The Rock however won cleanly at SummerSlam 2001 despite Shane McMahons helping Booker T

One particular example of this was during the Inaugural Brawl at the InVasion pay per view Besides Austins turn in the match that was needed to secure a WCWECW win over the WWF Slam Wrestling alleged that the Alliance wrestled poorly in comparison to the WWF wrestlers

Portrayed as disorganized and inferior grapplers the ECW WCW Team had more than its fair share of mistimed moves which hurt their own team members while the WWF squad of course wrestled like a well oiled machines The weakening of the ECW WCW dubbed superstars didnt stop there either The WWF faction battered their enemy tag partners off the ring apron over and over again making them appear weak and more times than not the ECW WCW grapplers gained an advantage only by double teaming or employing underhanded tactics The message sent was loud and clear The best of ECW WCW is not good enough to hang with the WWF

It has been speculated that the reason for this was because Vince McMahon did not want the WWF to look weak while fighting the Alliance as he worked very hard to put down his competition especially WCW Smash Wrestling alleges that WWF wrestlers needed to defect to make the Alliance appear to be a credible threat

The Invasion storyline was presented with a backdrop of a McMahon feud In storyline WWF was owned by Vince McMahon WCW was owned by Shane McMahon and ECW was owned by Stephanie McMahon Although the feud did not center completely around the McMahons the family feud storyline had been done many times before In addition to this the Stone Cold versus Vince McMahon feud was to start again when Vince McMahon hit Austin in the back of the head with a chair at No Mercy As stated by a Slam Wrestling synopsis of No Mercy 2001

For fans who didnt catch it the fifth tenth or twentieth time theyve run the angle Stone Cold Steve Austin and Vince McMahon are about to feud once again First up was Vincent McMahon labeling Austin with a steel chair as he was waiting to put a dazed RVD away Three minutes later it was Shane McMahons turn to hurl Kurt Angle out of the ring and into a steel ring post Vince tackled Shane over the announce table and the two began pummeling one another Back in the ring Austin laid a Stone Cold Stunner on to retain the belt as a disgruntled Vince scowled Gee how many times have we seen that scenario play itself out before Austin wins Vince fumes Fans snore Whatever

The storyline also allegedly centered too much on the McMahons who were getting more airtime than the wrestlers 

It has been argued that the Invasion angle may have been more successful if Paul Heyman and Eric Bischoff were perceived as controlling ECW and WCW respectively instead of Stephanie and Shane McMahon

Many fans had dreamed of a day where they could pit WWF and WCW wrestlers against each other but the storylines final match ended with four WWF wrestlers brawling it out As a column in Online World of Wrestling stated

While it was good TV it wasnt what everyone thought the WCW vs WWF would have been all about When the fans of WWF and WCW reminisced about a WCW vs WWF match back in the glory days of Monday Night Wars of around 1997 their match would have probably gone like this WCW would probably have a team of Hollywood Hulk Hogan Scott Hall Kevin Nash Goldberg and Ric Flair against maybe the WWF team of Stone Cold Steve Austin The Rock the Undertaker Shawn Michaels and Mick Foley Something like that anyway obviously even if Vince had done this thing right and signed some good WCW talent we would have had a match a little different due to factors such as retirement or injuries or something but still similar to that

It is important to note that some of the WCW wrestlers absences were out of the WWFs control Many of WCWs top wrestlers had contracts with AOL Time Warner WCWs parent company and were willing to sit at home rather than wrestle for less money Ric Flair and Rey Mysterio were not signed until the end of the Invasion because they were tied to their contracts and therefore their absence was out of the WWFs control In addition Scott Steiner was recovering from an injury Others such as Hulk Hogan Kevin Nash Scott Hall and Goldberg were not signed until well after the storyline finished Because of this the WWFs opponent allegedly lacked the strong identity of WCW 

To bolster the ranks of WCW some WWF wrestlers defected and joined the Alliance Although both WWF and WCW featured talents who had worked for both companies wrestlers such as Stone Cold had their greatest success in WWF and were seen by fans as WWF wrestlers Kurt Angle had never wrestled a match for either WCW or ECW but was a main player for the Alliance towards the end of the storyline In fact despite both being viewed as prominent WWF wrestlers they ended up not only being main players of the Alliance with Stone Cold being the leader that carried championship gold but also playing a bigger role than the WCW and ECW stars during the Invasion For example the final two Alliance members were Stone Cold and Angle at Survivor Series 2001  Booker T and Rob Van Dam were eliminated only after Shane McMahon

Several top WCW and ECW talent who were top superstars in their previous company such as Diamond Dallas Page Justin Credible Raven and Tazz were put down into low mid card matches while lesser ranked WWF wrestlers who defected to the Alliance such as Test were given a greater push

A caliphate is the Islamic form of government representing the political unity and leadership of the Muslim world The political authority of a Caliph as head of state of a Caliphate comes from the fact that he is seen as a successor to the Islamic prophet Muhammad

According to Sunnis he is ideally a member of the Quraysh tribe elected by Muslims or their representatives and according to Shia Islam an Imam descended in a line from the Ahl al Bayt From the time of Muhammad until 1924 successive and contemporary caliphates were held by various dynasties including the Umayyads the Abbasids the Fatimids and finally the Ottomans

The caliphate is the only form of governance that has full approval in traditional Islamic theology and is the core political concept of Sunni Islam by the consensus of the Muslim majority in the early centuries

Abu Bakr the first successor of Muhammad nominated Umar as his successor on his deathbed and there was consensus in the Muslim community to his choice His successor Uthman Ibn Affan was elected by a council of electors But soon he was seen by some more as a king than as an elected leader Uthman was killed by members of an opposition group Then Ali took control He was very popular with many but he was not accepted as caliph by the governors of Egypt Later on even some of his own guard were against him He had two major rebellions and was assassinated after a tumultuous rule of only five years This period is known as the Fitna or the first Islamic civil war

Muawiyah a relative of Uthman and governor of Syria became one of Alis challengers After Alis death he became Caliph Under him the caliphate became a hereditary office for the first time He founded the Umayyad dynasty

In areas which were previously under Persian or Byzantine rule the Caliphs lowered taxes provided greater local autonomy greater religious freedom for Jews indigenous Christians and brought peace to peoples that were demoralized and disaffected by the casualties and heavy taxation that resulted from the years of Byzantine Persian warfare

Under the Umayyads the Caliphate grew rapidly geographically Islamic rule expanded westward across North Africa and into Hispania and eastward through Persia and ultimately to Sindh and Punjab in modern day Pakistan This made it one of the largest unitary states in history and one of the few states to ever extend direct rule over three continents Although not ruling all of the Sahara homage was paid to the Caliph by Saharan Africa usually via various nomad Berber tribes

Largely due to the fact that they were not elected via Shura the Umayyad dynasty was not universally supported within the Muslim community Some supported prominent early Muslims like Al Zubayr others felt that only members of Muhammads clan the Banu Hashim or his own lineage the descendants of Ali should rule There were numerous rebellions against the Umayyads as well as splits within the Umayyad ranks Eventually supporters of the Banu Hisham and the supporters of the lineage of Ali united to bring down the Umayyads in 750 However the Shiat Al the Party of Ali were again disappointed when the Abbasid dynasty took power as the Abbasids were descended from Muhammads uncle Abbas ibn Abd al Muttalib and not from Ali Following this disappointment the Shiat Al finally split from the majority Sunni Muslims and formed what are today the several Shia denominations

The Umayyad Caliphate emerged as the rulers of the Islamic world Although they maintained the Sasanians administrative practices the Umayyads considered Islam as primarily an Arab religion and were wary of Persian culture They enforced use of the Arabic language in Persia leading to the demise of the Middle Persian or Pahlavi alphabet in favor of the new ArabicPersian alphabet in use to this day They attempted to assimilate Persians as they had Arabized and assimilated the Egyptians and the Assyrians but with much less success

During the Ummayad period Hispania was an integral province of the Ummayad Caliphate ruled from Damascus Syria Later the caliphate was won by the Abbasids and Al Andalus split from the Abbasid Caliph in Baghdad to form their own caliphate The Caliphate of Crdoba ruled the Iberian Peninsula from the city of Crdoba from 929 to 1031 This period was characterized by remarkable success in technology trade and culture many of the masterpieces of Spain were constructed in this period including the famous Great Mosque of Crdoba The title Caliph was claimed by Abd ar Rahman III on January 16 929 he was previously known as the Emir of Crdoba All Caliphs of Crdoba were members of the Umayyad dynasty the same dynasty had held the title Emir of Crdoba and ruled over roughly the same territory since 756 The rule of the Caliphate is known as the heyday of Muslim presence in the Iberian peninsula before it split into taifas Spain possessed a significant native Muslim population until 1610 with the success of the Catholic instigated Spanish Inquisition which expelled any remnants of Spanish Muslim or Jewish populations

The Abbasids had an unbroken line of Caliphs for over three centuries consolidating Islamic rule and cultivating great intellectual and cultural developments in the Middle East By 940 the power of the Caliphate under the Abbasids was waning as non Arabs particularly the Berbers of North Western Africa the Turkish and later the Mamluks in Egypt in the latter half of the 13th century gained influence and sultans and emirs became increasingly independent However the Caliphate endured as both a symbolic position and a unifying entity for the Islamic worldDuring the period of the Abassid dynasty Abassid claims to the caliphate did not go unchallenged The Shia Ubayd Allah al Mahdi Billah of the Fatimid dynasty which claimed descendency of Muhammad through his daughter claimed the title of Caliph in 909 creating a separate line of caliphs in North Africa Initially covering Morocco Algeria Tunisia and Libya the Fatimid caliphs extended their rule for the next 150 years taking Egypt and Palestine before the Abbassid dynasty was able to turn the tide limiting Fatimid rule to Egypt The Fatimid dynasty finally ended in 1171 The Umayyad dynasty which had survived and come to rule over the Muslim provinces of Spain reclaimed the title of Caliph in 929 lasting until it was overthrown in 1031

1258 saw the conquest of Baghdad and the execution of Abbasid caliph al Mustasim by Mongol forces under Hulagu Khan A surviving member of the Abbasid House was installed as Caliph at Cairo under the patronage of the Mamluk Sultanate three years later however the authority of this line of Caliphs was confined to ceremonial and religious matters and later Muslim historians referred to it as a shadow Caliphate

Ottoman rulers were known primarily by the title of Sultan and used the title of Caliph only sporadically Mehmed II and his grandson Selim I used it to justify their conquest of Islamic countries As the Ottoman Empire grew in size and strength Ottoman rulers beginning with Selim I began to claim Caliphal authority

Ottoman rulers used the title Caliph symbolically on many occasions but it was strengthened when the Ottoman Empire defeated the Mamluk Sultanate in 1517 and took control of most Arab lands The last Abbasid Caliph at Cairo al Mutawakkil III was taken into custody and was transported to Istanbul where he reportedly surrendered the Caliphate to Selim I According to Barthold the first time the title of Caliph was used as a political instead of symbolic religious title by the Ottomans was the peace treaty with Russia in 1774 The outcome of this war was disastrous for the Ottomans Large territories including those with large Muslim populations such as Crimea were lost to the Russian Empire However the Ottomans under Abdul Hamid I claimed a diplomatic victory by assigning themselves the protectors of Muslims in Russia as part of the peace treaty This was the first time the Ottoman caliph was acknowledged as having political significance outside of Ottoman borders by a European power As a consequence of this diplomatic victory as the Ottoman borders were shrinking the powers of the Ottoman caliph increased

Around 1880 Sultan Abdul Hamid II reasserted the title as a way of countering the spread of European colonialism in Muslim lands His claim was most fervently accepted by the Muslims of British India By the eve of the First World War the Ottoman state despite its weakness vis vis Europe represented the largest and most powerful independent Islamic political entity But the sultan also enjoyed some authority beyond the borders of his shrinking empire as caliph of Muslims in Egypt India and Central Asia

In the 1920s the Khilafat Movement a movement to defend the Ottoman Caliphate spread throughout the British colonial territories in Asia It was particularly strong in British India where it formed a rallying point for Indian Muslims and was the one of the many anti British Indian political movements to enjoy widespread support Its leaders included Maulana Mohammad Ali his brother Shawkat Ali and Abul Kalam Azad Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari and Hasrat Mohani For a time it worked in alliance with Hindu communities and was supported by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi who was a member of the Central Khilafat Committee However the movement lost its momentum after the arrest or flight of its leaders and a series of offshoots splintered off from the main organization

On March 3 1924 the first President of the Turkish Republic Mustafa Kemal Atatrk as part of his reforms constitutionally abolished the institution of the Caliphate Its powers within Turkey were transferred to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey of the newly formed Turkish Republic and the title has since been inactive

Singlish is a language used mostly in Singapore It is the first language of many younger Singaporeans especially those whose parents do not share a native language or dialect and is the second language of nearly all the rest of the countrys residents

The vocabulary of Singlish consists of words originating from English Malay Hokkien Teochew Cantonese Tamil and to a lesser extent various other European Indic and Sinitic languages while Singlish syntax resembles southern varieties of Chinese Also elements of American and Australian slang have come through from imported television series To date other Asian languages like Japanese Korean and other lesser known Chinese dialects such as Shanghainese have also been incorporated into Singlish Recently due to the fact that Mandarin is taught to all Singaporean Chinese in school Mandarin words have also found their way into Singlish Singlish is a creole of English

Singlish is closely related to Manglish of neighboring Malaysia

The Singaporean government currently discourages the use of Singlish in favour of Singapore Standard English as it believes in the need for Singaporeans to be able to effectively communicate with the other English users in the world The government runs the Speak Good English Movement to emphasise the point

Shortwave radio is a name for radio broadcasting in the range of 3 30 broken wikt linkmegahertzmegahertz and for the radio receivers made to tune in broadcasts The earths ionosphere carries radio waves in this range over great distances and signals can travel around the globe under certain conditions This makes it possible for radio stations all over the world to broadcast to listeners in faraway countries Sunspot activity and broken wikt linksolar flaresolar flares can interfere with shortwave reception and different frequencies work better at different times during the year

Since their beginning in the early days of radio shortwave stations have carried news and cultural information about the stations locality or country of origin Many governments or national news agencies have shortwave stations that broadcast in both English and their native languages so they can inform both non natives and natives about things in their country Some broadcast in several different languages to reach a wider listening audience Some of these stations are Voice of America Radio Canada International BBC World Service Deutsche Welle Voice of Russia Channel Africa China Radio International Radio Japan and All India Radio

Shortwave stations may also be run by private companies or groups Some broadcast religious programming HCJB and WEWN include actual church services in their programs Others may broadcast weather or time information WWV and WWVH give the current Coordinated Universal Time at 2500 5000 10000 and 15000 megahertz WWV is also on 20000 megahertz

Bavarian or Austro Bavarian is a major group of Upper German varieties Like standard German Austro Bavarian is a High German language but they are not the same language However Austro Bavarian and Standard German have influenced each other and the vast majority of Austro Bavarian speakers speak Standard German as well

Austro Bavarian is also used to refer to the dialect group which includes the Austro Bavarian dialect discussed here as well as the Cimbrian Hutterite German and Mcheno dialects of Germany

The Austro Bavarian language has its origins in the Germanic tribe known as the Bavarii who established a tribal duchy which covered much of what is today Bavaria and some of Austria in the early Middle Ages and was eventually subdued by Charlemagne However they gradually migrated down the Danube and into the Alps to all those areas where Austro Bavarian dialects are spoken

In German there is usually a difference made between bairisch and bayerisch Because of King Ludwig Is passion for everything Hellenic the German name for Bavaria today is spelled Bayern while the language spoken there has retained its original spelling Bairischnote the I versus the Hellenic Y

The Brahui or Bravi language spoken by the Brahui it is the only Dravidian language mainly spoken in Pakistan although it is also spoken in Afghanistan and Iran The 2005 edition of Ethnologue reports some 22 million speakers 90 of whom live in Pakistan In Pakistan it is mainly spoken in the Kalat region of Balochistan

Although it is a Dravidian language it has been heavily influenced by the Iranian languages spoken in the area such as Balochi

Brahui is often considered to be a remnant of a formerly more widespread Dravidian language family that was speculated to have reduced during the Indo Aryan migration It is also sometimes speculated that Brahui might be a direct legacy of the Indus Valley Civilisation However one polar opposite view is that Brahuis migrated up to Baluchistan in the 13 or 14th century or by a late immigration that took place after 1000 CE

Burushaski is a language isolate spoken by some 87000 Burusho people in the Hunza Nagar Yasin and parts of the Gilgit valleys in the Northern Areas Pakistan It is also spoken by some 300 speakers in Srinagar Indian administered Kashmir Other names for the language are Kanjut Werchikwr Boorishki Brushas

Today Burushaski contains numerous loanwords from Urdu and from neighbouring Dardic languages such as Khowar and Shina as well as a few from Turkic languages and from the neighboring Sino Tibetan language Balti but the original vocabulary remains largely intact The Dardic languages also contain large numbers of loanwords from Burushaski

There are three dialects named after the main valleys Hunza Nagar and Yasin The dialect of Yasin is thought to be the least affected by contact with neighboring languages and is generally less similar to the other two than those are to each other nevertheless all three dialects are mutually intelligible

Khowaralso known as Chitrali is a Dardic language spoken by 453765 people in Chitral in Northwest Pakistan in Yasin Valley and Gupis in neighboring Gilgit and in parts of Upper Swat It is spoken as a second language in the rest of Gilgit and Hunza There are believed to be small numbers of Khowar speakers in Afghanistan China Tajikistan and Istanbul

Khowar has been influenced by Iranian languages to a greater degree than other Dardic languages and has less Sanskritic elements than Shina or the Kohistani languages Colonel Biddulph was amongst the first westerners to study Khowar and claimed that further research would prove Khowar to be equally derived from Zend and Sanskrit

The Norwegian Linguist Georg Morgenstierne wrote that Chitral is the area of the greatest linguistic diversity in the world Although Khowar is the predominant language of Chitral more than ten other languages are spoken here These include Kalasha mun Palula Dameli Gawar Bati Nuristani Yidgha Burushahski Gujar Wakhi Kyrgyz Persian and Pashto Since many of these languages have no written form letters are usually written in Urdu

Khowar has been written in the Arabic Nastaliq script since the early twentieth century prior to that the administrative and literary language of the region was Persian and works such as poetry and songs in Khowar were passed down in oral tradition Today Urdu and English are the official languages and the only major literary usage of Khowar is in writing poetry Khowar has also been written in the Roman script since the 1960s Badshah Munir Bukhari and Rahmat Aziz Chitrali worked on the language and its family

Domaak  also known as Dumaki or Doma  is a language spoken in the Northern Areas of Pakistan

It is the traditional tongue of the Doma a small ethnic group scattered in extended family units among larger host communities In former times Domaaki speakers traditionally worked as blacksmiths and musicians but nowadays they are also engaged in a variety of other professions 

In almost all places of their present settlement the Dooma who are all Muslims have long since given up their original mother tongue in favour of the language of their respective host community Only in the Nager and Hunza Valleys has Domaaki survived until the present day 

Following its geographic location Domaaki can be divided into two dialects Nager Domaaki and Hunza Domaaki Although there are considerable differences between these two varieties they are not so severe as to prevent mutual intelligibility 

Presently Domaaki counts less then 350 speakers ca 300 of them related to Hunza around 40 related to Nager and is thus to be considered a highly endangered language

A sunspot is an area of high magnetic activity on the surface of the Sun Sunspots produce bright light but not as much as the surface around them so they appear dark by comparison They are cooler than the rest of the sun Some are small and some are ten times bigger than Earth

Chinese astronomers said they could see sunspots On 17 March 802 the monk Adelmus saw a big sunspot which he could see for eight days Adelmus thought that Mercury was going in front of the Sun and making a black spot However they did not really know what sunspots were until Galileo Galilei said a right explanation in 1612

The Old Firm is the name given to the relationship between two football teams in Scotland Rangers FC and Celtic FC

1888 1999 statistics obtained from RSSSF Remaining stats obtained from Soccerbase

The Old Firm have a lot of history possibly dating back to around 1888 Celtics first match which was against Rangers when a newspaper report stated that both sets of players got on so well that you would believe that they were old firm friends However William J Murray states that the term comes from the commercial benefits of the two clubs rivalry which were viewed with distaste in some parts in the early days of the game 

The two clubs are the most successful in Scotland having won between them 63 Scottish Cups and 93 Scottish Premier League championships The two clubs normally compete four times a year in the SPL and are regularly drawn against each other in the two Scottish cup competitions 

The clubs have large support bases around Glasgow but also have supporters clubs in most towns throughout Scotland and in many cities around the world The presence of Rangers and Celtic has been estimated to be worth 120 million to the Scottish economy

The two clubs fan bases have historically been divided on religious lines Celtic are supported by Catholics while Rangers are supported by Protestants

There have been many high profile players to play for both sides of the Old Firm The most recent players to do so are Kenny Miller Maurice Johnston Steven Pressley Mark Brown and Barry Robson Kenny Miller is the first player in the modern era to cross the Old Firm divide twice having played for Rangers then Celtic then moving back to Rangers

Despite being based in Scotland the club played in English football between 1947 and 2002 The club was elected to the Scottish Football League at the third attempt in 2002 Under the ownership of businessman Brooks Mileson who invested millions of pounds in what was a village team the club went from the Third Division side to the Scottish Premier League in less than five years

While in the SPL however the club were placed in administration after Mileson withdrew his financial support The club finished in the relegation position in the SPL At the end of the season all of the clubs staff were made redundant and the club was initially relegated to the Third Division due to their inability to guarantee fulfilment of their 2008 09 fixtures 

After this demotion the one remaining potential buyer withdrew their offer to buy the club In the belief that Gretna has ceased to exist they resigned their place in the Scottish Football League on June 3

Nazi Germany started a strong anti tobacco movement and led the first public anti smoking campaign in modern history Anti tobacco movements grew in many countries from the beginning of the 20th century But all these had little success The only exception was Germany where the campaign was supported by the government after the Nazis came to power It was the most powerful anti smoking movement in the world in the 1930s and early 1940s The Nazi leaders opposed smoking and some of them openly said what is wrong with tobacco consumption Research on smoking and its effects on health got better under Nazi rule and was the most important of its type at that time Hitlers personal feeling of dislike for tobacco and the Nazi reproductive policies were among the causes due to which the Nazis started their campaign against smoking This campaign was linked with antisemitism and racism

The Nazi anti tobacco campaign used many methods like restrictions on smoking in public spaces limiting tobacco advertising restrictions on tobacco rations for women restrictions on restaurants and coffeehouses promoting health education banning smoking in trams buses and city trains limiting cigarette rations in the Wehrmacht organizing medical lectures for soldiers and increasing the tobacco tax The anti tobacco movement did not have much effect in the early years of the Nazi rule Tobacco use increased between 1933 and 1939 But smoking by military personnel declined from 1939 to 1945 This anti smoking campaign was more powerful and serious than the anti tobacco movement in Germany at the beginning of the 21st century

Anti tobacco thoughts existed in Germany in the early 1900s People who disliked smoking formed the first anti tobacco group in the country named the Deutscher Tabakgegnerverein zum Schutze der Nichtraucher Established in 1904 this organization existed for a brief period only The next anti tobacco organization the Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner was established in 1910 in Trautenau Bohemia Other anti smoking organizations were established in 1912 in the cities of Hanover and Dresden In 1920 a Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner in der Tschechoslowakei was formed in Prague after Czechoslovakia was separated from Austria at the end of World War I A Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner in Deutschsterreich was established in Graz in 1920

These groups published journals advocating nonsmoking The first such German language journal was Der Tabakgegner published by the Bohemian organization between 1912 and 1932 The Deutsche Tabakgegner was published in Dresden from 1919 to 1935 and was the second journal on this issue The anti tobacco organizations were also against consumption of alcohol

Adolf Hitler was a heavy smoker in his early lifehe used to smoke 25 to 40 cigarettes dailybut gave up after concluding it was a waste of money In later years Hitler viewed smoking as decadent and the wrath of the Red Man against the White Man vengeance for having been given hard liquor lamenting that so many excellent men have been lost to tobacco poisoning He was unhappy because both Eva Braun and Martin Bormann were smokers and was concerned over Hermann Grings continued smoking in public places He was angered when a statue of Gring showed a cigar in his mouth Hitler is often considered to be the first national leader to advocate nonsmoking

Hitler disapproved of the military personnels freedom to smoke and during World War II he said on March 2 1942 it was a mistake traceable to the army leadership at the time at the beginning of the war He also said that it was not correct to say that a soldier cannot live without smoking He promised to end the use of tobacco in the military after the end of the war Hitler personally encouraged close friends not to smoke and rewarded those who quit smoking However Hitlers personal distaste for tobacco was only one of several catalysts behind the anti smoking campaign

The Nazi reproductive policies were a significant factor behind their anti tobacco campaign Women who smoked were considered to be vulnerable to premature aging and loss of physical attractiveness they were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a German family Werner Huttig of the Nazi Partys Rassenpolitisches Amt claimed smoking mothers breast milk contained nicotine Martin Staemmler a prominent physician during the Third Reich opined that smoking by pregnant women resulted in a higher rate of stillbirths and miscarriages This opinion was also supported by well known female racial hygienist Agnes Bluhm whose book published in 1936 expressed the same view The Nazi leadership was concerned over this because they wanted German women to give birth An article published in a German gynaecology journal in 1943 stated that women smoking three or more cigarettes per day were more likely to remain childless compared to nonsmoking women

Research and studies on tobaccos effects on the populations health were more advanced in Germany than in any other nation by the time the Nazis came to power The link between lung cancer and tobacco was first proved in Nazi Germany contrary to the popular belief that American and British scientists first discovered it in the 1950s The term passive smoking was coined in Nazi Germany Research projects funded by the Nazis revealed many disastrous effects of smoking on health Nazi Germany supported epidemiological research on the harmful effects of tobacco use Hitler personally gave financial support to the Wissenschaftliches Institut zur Erforschung der Tabakgefahren at the University of Jena headed by Karl Astel Established in 1941 it was the most significant anti tobacco institute in Nazi Germany

Franz H Mller in 1939 and E Schairer in 1943 first used case control epidemiological methods to study lung cancer among smokers In 1939 Mller published a study report in a reputed cancer journal in Germany claiming that prevalence of lung cancer was higher among smokers Mller described as the forgotten father of experimental epidemiology was a member of the National Socialist Motor Corps and the National Socialist German Workers Party Mllers 1939 medical dissertation was the worlds first controlled epidemiological study of the relationship between tobacco and lung cancer Apart from mentioning the increasing incidents of lung cancer and many of the causes behind it such as dust exhaust gas from cars tuberculosis X ray and pollutants emitted from factories Mllers paper pointed out that the significance of tobacco smoke has been pushed more and more into the foreground

Physicians in the Third Reich were aware that smoking is responsible for cardiac diseases which were considered to be the most serious diseases resulting from smoking Use of nicotine was sometimes considered to be responsible for increasing reports of myocardial infarction in the country In the later years of World War II researchers considered nicotine a factor behind the coronary heart failures suffered by a significant number of military personnel in the Eastern Front A pathologist of the Heer examined thirty two young soldiers who had died from myocardial infarction at the front and documented in a 1944 report that all of them were enthusiastic smokers He cited the opinion of pathologist Franz Buchner that cigarettes are a coronary poison of the first order

The Nazis used several public relations tactics to convince the general population of Germany not to smoke Well known health magazines like the Gesundes Volk Volksgesundheit and Gesundes Leben published warnings about the health consequences of smoking and posters showing the harmful effects of tobacco were displayed Anti smoking messages were sent to the people in their workplaces often with the help of the Hitler Jugend and the Bund Deutscher Mdel The anti smoking campaign undertaken by the Nazis also included health education In June 1939 a Bureau against the Hazards of Alcohol and Tobacco was formed and the Reichsstelle fr Rauschgiftbekmpfung also helped in the anti tobacco campaign Articles advocating nonsmoking were published in the magazines Die Genussgifte Auf der Wacht and Reine Luft Out of these magazines Reine Luft was the main journal of the Nazi anti tobacco movement

After recognizing the harmful effects of smoking on health several items of anti smoking legislation were enacted The later 1930s increasingly saw anti tobacco laws implemented by the Nazis In 1938 the Luftwaffe and the Reichspost imposed a ban on smoking Smoking was also banned not only in health care institutions but also in several public offices and in rest homes Midwives were restricted from smoking while on duty In 1939 the Nazi Party outlawed smoking in all of its offices premises and Heinrich Himmler the then chief of the Schutzstaffel restricted police personnel and SS officers from smoking while they were on duty Smoking was also outlawed in schools

In 1941 tobacco smoking in trams was outlawed in sixty German cities Smoking was also outlawed in bomb shelters however some shelters had separate rooms for smoking Special care was taken to prevent women from smoking The President of the Medical Association in Germany announced German women dont smoke Pregnant women and women below the age of 25 and over the age of 55 were not given tobacco ration cards during World War II Restrictions on selling tobacco products to women were imposed on the hospitality and food retailing industry Anti tobacco films aimed at women were publicly aired Editorials discussing the issue of smoking and its effects were published in newspapers Strict measures were taken in this regard and a district department of the National Socialist Factory Cell Organization announced that it would expel female members who smoked publicly The next step in the anti tobacco campaign came in July 1943 when public smoking for persons under the age of 18 was outlawed In the next year smoking in buses and city trains was made illegal on the personal initiative of Hitler who feared female ticket takers might be the victims of passive smoking

Restrictions were imposed on the advertisement of tobacco products enacted on December 7 1941 and signed by Heinrich Hunke the President of the Advertising Council Advertisements trying to depict smoking as harmless or as an expression of masculinity were banned Ridiculing anti tobacco activists was also outlawed as was the use of advertising posters along rail tracks in rural regions stadiums and racing tracks Advertising by loudspeakers and mail was also prohibited

Restrictions on smoking were also introduced in the Wehrmacht Cigarette rations in the military were limited to six per soldier per day Extra cigarettes were often sold to the soldiers especially when there was no military advance or retreat in the battleground however these were restricted to 50 for each person per month Access to cigarettes was not allowed for the Wehrmachts female auxiliary personnel Medical lectures were arranged to persuade military personnel to quit smoking An ordinance enacted on November 3 1941 raised tobacco taxes by approximately 8095 of the retail price It would be the highest rise in tobacco taxes in Germany for more than 25 years after the collapse of the Nazi regime

The early anti smoking campaign was considered a failure and from 1933 to 1937 there was a rapid increase in tobacco consumption in Germany The rate of smoking in the nation increased faster even than in neighboring France where the anti tobacco movement was tiny and far less influential Between 1932 and 1939 per capita cigarette consumption in Germany increased from 570 to 900 per year while the corresponding numbers for France were from 570 to 630

The cigarette manufacturing companies in Germany made several attempts to weaken the anti tobacco campaign They published new journals and tried to depict the anti tobacco movement as fanatic and unscientific The tobacco industry also tried to counter the government campaign to prevent women from smoking and used smoking models in their advertisements Despite government regulations many women in Germany regularly smoked including the wives of many high ranking Nazi officials For instance Magda Goebbels smoked even while she was interviewed by a journalist Fashion illustrations displaying women with cigarettes were often published in prominent publications such as the Beyers Mode fr Alle The cover of the popular song Lili Marleen featured singer Lale Andersen holding a cigarette

The Nazis implemented more anti tobacco policies at the end of the 1930s and by the early years of World War II the rate of tobacco usage declined As a result of the anti tobacco measures implemented in the Wehrmacht the total tobacco consumption by soldiers decreased between 1939 and 1945 According to a survey conducted in 1944 the number of smokers increased in the Wehrmacht but average tobacco consumption per military personnel declined by 234 compared to the immediate pre World War II years The number of people who smoked 30 or more cigarettes per day declined from 44 to 03

The Nazi anti tobacco policies were not exempt of contradictions For example the Volksgesundheit and Gesundheitspflicht policies were enforced in parallel with the active distribution of cigarettes to people who the Nazis saw deserving groups Undeserving and stigmatized groups however were denied access to tobacco

Apart from public health concerns the Nazis were heavily influenced by ideology specifically the movement was influenced by concepts of racial hygiene and bodily purity Nazi leaders believed that it was wrong for the master race to smoke and that tobacco consumption was equal to racial degeneracy The Nazis viewed tobacco as a genetic poison Racial hygienists opposed tobacco use fearing that it would corrupt the German germ plasm Nazi anti tobacco activists often tried to depict tobacco as a vice of the degenerate Africans

the Nazis claimed that the Jews were responsible for introducing tobacco and its harmful effects The Seventh day Adventist Church in Germany announced that smoking was an unhealthy vice spread by the Jews Johann von Leers editor of the Nordische Welt during the opening ceremony of the Wissenschaftliches Institut zur Erforschung der Tabakgefahren in 1941 proclaimed that Jewish capitalism was responsible for the spread of tobacco use across Europe He said that the first tobacco on German soil was brought by the Jews and that they controlled the tobacco industry in Amsterdam the principal European entry point of Nicotiana

After the collapse of the Nazi Germany at the end of World War II American cigarette manufactures quickly entered the German market Illegal smuggling of tobacco became prevalent and leaders of the Nazi anti smoking campaign were silenced In 1949 approximately 400 million cigarettes manufactured in the United States entered Germany illegally every month In 1954 nearly two billion Swiss cigarettes were smuggled into Germany and Italy As part of the Marshall Plan the United States sent free tobacco to Germany the amount of tobacco shipped into Germany in 1948 was 24000 tons and was as high as 69000 tons in 1949 The Federal government of the United States spent 70 million on this scheme to the delight of cigarette manufacturing companies in the United States who profited hugely Per capita yearly cigarette consumption post war Germany steadily rose from 460 in 1950 to 1523 in 1963 The present day anti tobacco campaign in Germany has been unable to exceed the seriousness of the Nazi era climax in the years 193941 and German tobacco health research at the end of the 20th century is described by Robert N Proctor as muted

The Athanasian Creed is a Christian statement of faith It is also often referred to as Quicumque vult It is the first known creed to talk about trinity It has been in use since the 6th century mainly in the western part of the Church It is not used very much today the Nicene Creed has largely replaced it

From about the 9th century people thought that St Athanasius had written it Athanasus lived in the 4th century in Egypt Today this view is largely seen as false This is because of the following

Today most people think it came from Gaul around the year 500 Its positions are similar to those taken by St Ambrose of Milan Augustine of Hippo or Vincent of Lrins JND Kelly a contemporary patristics scholar believes that St Vincent of Lrins was not its author but suggests that it may have come from the same bacground namely the area of Lerins in southern Gaul Caesarius of Arles is one of the possible authors 

The oldest surviving manuscripts of the Athanasian creed date from the late 8th century

Martin Luther said there were three statements of faith the Nicene Creed the Te Deum and the Athanasian Creed 

The creed starts

It explains Trinity in such a way to stand against positions such as Arianism It has the filioque

Acanthopolis was an armoured ankylosaurian dinosaur This quadrupedal plant eating dinosaur had its armour in rows of oval plates set into its skin It also had spikes jutting out of its neck and shoulder area along the spine It was about 15 feet long and weighed roughly 380 kg

The first specimen was found in 1865 by fossil collector John Griffiths on the shoreline at Folkestone The stratum was Cambridge Greensand a formation in the Lower Cretaceous of southern England At the time England was part of a huge tropical river delta and the Greensand was laid down just offshore It appears the dinosaurs were on the shoreline or the river delta and their bodies washed out to sea

Noasaurus was a small meat eating dinosaur It lived at a time when some of the biggest dinosaurs ever to live were roaming South America Although it had some of the same characteristics as raptors that lived in North America and Asia it was not a close relative This little hunter is a good example of how dinosaurs filled lots of roles in the environment Not only were dinosaurs the biggest hunters but they were also among the smallest

It was discovered by Jaime Powell and Jos Bonaparte in northwestern Argentina Its unique foot claw has caused a great deal of discussion regarding the evolutionary lineage of this dinosaur

Astrodon was a long necked plant eating dinosaur relacioned to Brachiosaurus a sauropod that was about 30 feet long It lived during the early Cretaceous period about 130 million to 120 million years ago Astrodon is known only from fossilized teeth found in Maryland USA Astrodon was named by Johnston in 1859 The type species is A johnstoni Astrodon may be the same as Pleurocoelus

openSUSE is a community project sponsored by Novell and AMD to develop and maintain a general purpose Linux distribution After taking over SUSE Linux in January 2004 Novell decided to release the SUSE Linux Professional product as a 100 open source project involving the community in the development process The initial release was a beta version of SUSE Linux 100 and as of October 2007 the current stable release is openSUSE 110

OpenSUSE 111 has full support for 32 bit i586 and 64 bit x86 64 PC hardware as well as PowerPC processors The basic requirements for non PPC hardware is as follows

Older processors that still belong to the i586 family can be used for example the AMD K62 When extra languagetranslation files and documentation are removed and X is not needed decent console based router systems can be made using 300 MB disk space Most console workloads also cope with 128 MB at the cost of increased swap activity in tight situations

The Second Boer War was much longer In 1886 people found gold near Pretoria the capital city of Boer territory In 1895 a British group from Rhodesia tried to take control of Johannesburg but the police stopped them The Boer president Paul Kruger was worried about the British so the Boers bought new weapons Because of this many British soldiers moved to the area 

In October of 1899 Boer soldiers attacked the British They started a siege stopping people from entering or leaving at the towns of Mafeking and Ladysmith The British Army took control of most of the area in 1900 but Boer soldiers still attacked them from their homes using guerrilla warfare The British took many prisoners and put them in concentration camps They also destroyed many Boer homes because they wanted to stop the attacks 

In Britain the war was very unpopular because it was expensive and many soldiers had died People also knew about the concentration camps and did not like them In 1902 it was very difficult for the Boers to fight so the British government tried to make peace The war ended in May 1902 75000 people died in the war 22000 from the British Army and 53000 Boers Many of them died from disease

At the end of the war the British made a new country called the Union of South Africa This was in 1910

Pioneer movements are movements for children and adolescents They were founded in countries where there is a Communist party Many of the ideas are taken from the scout movement

In most socialist countries people can choose if they want to be members of the pioneer movement or not There are many differences between a pioneer movement and the scout movement Scout movements are independent of governments They are also not controlled by the state For example there were no separate organizations for boys and girls During the time of the USSR thousands of Young Pioneer camps and Young Pioneer Palaces were built These could only be used by Young Pioneers The camps and palaces were also free of charge it did not cost any money to use them The government and trade unions sponsored them There were many newspapers and magazines published for Young Pioneers Some sold millions of copies

Certain features however are similar to the Scout movement The two movements share some principles like preparedness and promotion of sports and outdoor skills The pioneer movement also includes teaching of communist principles Opponents of Communist states claim that this is a form of indoctrination

A member of the movement is known as a pioneer and a scarf typically red but sometimes light blue is the traditional item of clothing worn by a pioneer The pioneer organization is often named after a famous party member that is considered a suitable role model for young communists 

In the USSR it was Lenin in East Germany it was Ernst Thlmann The Thlmann pioneers were taught the slogan Ernst Thlmann is my role model We wear our red scarf with prideAlbania which had severed diplomatic relations with the USSR since 1961 also had a certain variant of Pioneer organization called Pioneers of Enver named after the communist ruler of Albania Enver Hoxha

Today the following countries have pioneer movements

Older children could continue in other communist organizations but that would typically be done only by a limited number of people

Lalor was born at Tenakill Queens County Ireland into a large family active in Irish politics He left Ireland with his brother Richard and went to Victoria Australia in 1852 They worked on building the railway between Melbourne and Geelong In 1853 Peter went to the Ovens River looking for gold and Richard went back to Ireland Peter Lalor went to Ballarat to look for gold in 1854

In 1854 the miners working in the goldfields became very angry about the cost of a gold mining license In Ballarat the miners started the Ballarat Reform League and demanded changes to the laws The government would not accept the demands and the police increased the violent hunts for miners without licenses Peter Lalor became leader of the Reform League on November 30 1854 and made the miners promise to protect their rights and liberties He told the miners to get weapons and be ready in case they were attacked They built a small fort or stockade at Eureka in east Ballarat This fort the Eureka Stockade was attacked by 276 government soldiers at dawn on December 3 1854 Thirty miners were killed and Lalor was badly hurt Friends hid him from the soldiers and he was able to get away His left arm had to be amputated

After Eureka Lalor was hidden in Geelong until the police stopped looking for him The government changed the laws and miners on the goldfields were able to elect people to Parliament Lalor was elected in November 1855 As part of the democratic changes Victoria got a ha constitution in 1856 and Lalor was elected to the new Parliament His political views were not as democratic as the Ballarat miners wanted He was against giving every one the right to vote and he wanted some people in the parliament to be appointed not elected Lalor became a director of several mining companies He even supported wage cuts for miners working in his mines He was seen as more interested in money and power than in peoples rights In 1859 he changed his seat in parliament and did not represent the Ballarat miners again

In January 1871 Lalor lost his seat in an election He was made Chairman of the Clunes Water Commission with the job of getting water for the town of Clunes He was voted back into parliament again in 1874 In 1875 he became Postmaster General and later Commissioner for Trade and Customs From 1880 to 1887 he was Speaker of the Legislative Assembly Lalors wife and daughter died in 1887 he was also sick with diabetes so he stopped being Speaker but stayed as representative for South Grant until his death

Xfce is a free software desktop environment for Unix and other Unix like platforms such as Linux Solaris and BSD It is made to be fast and quick while still looking nice and easy to use

The current version 46 is modular and reusable It is based on the GTK 2 toolkit It uses the Xfwm window manager described below Its configuration is entirely mouse driven and the configuration files are hidden from the casual user

Olivier Fourdan started the project in 1996 The name Xfce originally stood for XForms Common Environment but after that Xfce has been rewritten twice and no longer uses that toolkit The name survived but it is no longer capitalized as XFce but rather as Xfce 

Starting with version 42 the window manager of Xfce Xfwm integrates its own compositing manager Other compositing managers exist but have been very unstable and Xfce was the first to put its own compositing manager into the window manager At its beginning many users called it the most stable one available though at the time in late 2004 xcompmgr was the only other compositing manager available

While not as common in Linux distributions as the KDE and GNOME desktop environments there are still some distributions where Xfce is the default desktop environment and most support it as an optional part

These distributions include Xfce in their default environment

Linux Mint is a Linux distribution for desktop computers based on and compatible with Debian 

While at the core Linux Mint is mostly based on Ubuntu the design of the desktop and User interface are very different These differences include a very unique desktop theme a custom Linux Mint menu and the MintTools a collection of system tools designed to make managing the computer easier for users

Originally Linux Mint did not follow a predictable release cycle The project first defined the goals for the next releaseFactdateDecember 2007 and when all the goals are achieved a beta is released and a date is announced for the stable release Recently however it has been decided that Linux Mint will be with the 6 month Ubuntu release cycle

Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu and both distributions have a lot in common Both distributions use the same software repositories For instance release 22 uses the package pools of Ubuntu Edgy Eft Most packages are the same on both distributions and the two systems behave almost identically

Most differences are on the desktop Ubuntu and Linux Mint both focus on usability but Linux Mint offers a different user experience and it includes a number of applications that are not available in Ubuntu

Many popular multimedia codecs are installed by default in Linux Mint Ubuntu and many other gratis GNULinux distributions do not distribute these codecs with the initial install media due to patent encumberment issues 

Ubuntu has a vastly larger support community than Linux Mint However the majority of Ubuntu help and advice is also applicable to Linux Mint Ubuntu supports more languages from the LiveCD and comes with better localizationFactdateDecember 2007 Lastly whilst Linux Mint only supports x86 architectures Ubuntu also supports x86 64

The Te Deum is a Christian hymn Its original text was Latin It is named after the first few words Te Deum laudamus It was probably written around the 4th or 5th century Most say that either Augustine of Hippo or Ambrose wrote it Some say it was by Nicetas bishop of Remesiana Others have said that the hymn was taken from two earlier hymns one to God the Father and another to God the Son After this idea the second hymn begins with the phrase Tu rex gloriae Christe The petitions at the end of the hymn are from verses from the book of Psalms added to the original hymn later on

Te Deum is close in theology to the Apostles Creed It has both a poetic view of the heavenly liturgy with a declaration of faith God is named from the start of the song The hymn then names all people who praise and respect God from the hierarchy of heavenly creatures to Christians who are already in heaven to the Church in all the world

Te Deum then returns to its creedal formula singing about Christ and remembering His birth suffering and glorification Then the hymn stops singing about praise both the Church in general and the singer himself and asks for mercy on past sins protection from future sin and the hope to be reunited with Christians in Heaven

Many people have written music for the text Such as Bruckner Verdi Berlioz Dvok Haydn Britten and Mozart just naming a few Antonio Vivaldi wrote a setting of the Te Deum but it is now lost The prelude to Charpentiers setting is well known in Europe because it is used as the theme music for the European Broadcasting Union most notably the Eurovision Song Contest Sir William Waltons Coronation Te Deum was written for the coronation of HM Queen Elizabeth II in 1952 Other English Te Deums have been written such as the ones by William Byrd Thomas Tallis Henry Purcell three by George Frideric Handel and that of Edward Elgar his Op 34 A version by Father Michael Keating is popular with Charismatics Mark Hayes recently wrote his own version of Te Deum and British composer John Rutter has composed two one of them is just titled the traditional Te Deum the other Winchester Te Deum Igor Stravinsky set the first 12 lines of the text as part of The Flood in 1962

In philosophy something is good if it is important or valuable Objects people ideas and actions can be good Many philosophers have thought about what it means for something to be good This issue is also called Value 

An economic good can become more or less valuable over time This is because an economic good is valuable because people will give up something for it A philosophical good is always good even if there are no people to see it This is because philosophical goods are good because of something in themselves 

Goods can be absolute or relative A relative good is something that is good because people say it is good An absolute good is something that is good because of something in itself It is good even if there is no one around to see it For example an economist may say that the Mona Lisa is a very valuable economic good because it can be sold for a lot of money A philosopher may say that the painting is good because of how it is painted The economist sees relative good because people may later not want to pay for it The philosopher sees absolute good because it will always be painted well

Erasmus Darwin was a scientist poet inventor and a medical doctor He was a member of the Lunar Society Erasmus Darwin looked at how living things evolved His grandson Charles Darwin later wrote a book that explained evolution by natural selection 

Darwin was born in Newark on Trent a town in Nottinghamshire His father was a lawyer When Erasmus was a child he was very interested in nature He liked clocks and electricity He understood nature well He said that people should eat meat during Lent a Christian festival before Easter when people eat only simple food 

He went to the University of Cambridge and then studied to be a doctor in Edinburgh He became a doctor in 1756 and worked in Lichfield in Staffordshire He worked hard and learned a lot about medicine Soon lots of people respected him and the King George III asked him to become the Royal Doctor but Erasmus preferred to stay where he was

Darwin married twice and had 14 children including two illegitimate daughters by an employee and possibly at least one further illegitimate daughter In addition to the five children of his first marriage to Mary Howard and seven to his second wife Elizabeth Pole there are two daughters by the governess Mary Parker and another probable with a married woman Lucy Smith

Darwin formed the Lichfield Botanical Society in order to translate the works of the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus from Latin into English This took seven years The result was two publications A System of Vegetables between 1783 and 1785 and The Families of Plants in 1787 In these volumes Darwin coined many of the English plant names that we use today

Darwin then wrote The Loves of the Plants a long poem which was a popular rendering of Linnaeus works Darwin also wrote Economy of Vegetation and together the two were published as The Botanic Garden 

His last long poem the Temple of Nature was published after his death in 1803 This is considered his best poetic work It centers on his own newly conceived theory of evolution tracing traces the progression of life from microorganisms to civilized society 

Darwins most important scientific work is Zonomia which contains a system of pathology and a treatise on generation in which he anticipated some of Lamarcks ideas on evolution

The essence of his views is contained in the following passage which he follows up with the conclusion that one and the same kind of living filament is and has been the cause of all organic life 

Would it be too bold to imagine that in the great length of time since the earth began to exist perhaps millions of ages before the commencement of the history of mankind would it be too bold to imagine that all warm blooded animals have arisen from one living filament which the great First Cause endued with animality with the power of acquiring new parts attended with new propensities directed by irritations sensations volitions and associations and thus possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity and of delivering down these improvements by generation to its posterity world without end

This is a clear statement of the kind of evolutionary thinking which Lamarck is known for

Darwins idea of evolution surfaced in several of his other works In the Loves of the Plants reprinted in several editions as The Botanic Garden there occurs the comment Perhaps all the productions of nature are in their progress to greater perfection All these natural history works are in the form of poems and so they are not satisfactory from the point of view of modern science But the 18th century was a time when intelligent men made connections the specialist types of scientist occurred first in the lifetime of his grandson Charles 

The last two leaves of Darwins A plan for the conduct of female education in boarding schools contain a book list an apology for the work and an advert for Miss Parkers School The work probably resulted from his liaison with Mary Parker The school advertised on the last page is the one he set up in Ashbourne Derbyshire for their two illegitimate children Susanna and Mary

Darwin translated the work of Carolus Linnaeus from Latin to English The books explain how different plant species are related to each other Darwin made the English names for many plants He was friends with many important scientists and businessmen the Lunar Society These men shared lots of ideas They supported the French and American Revolution and wanted to end slavery Darwin wrote poems against slavery He was a broken wikt linkgenerousgenerous man he helped people who had no money He wrote poems explaining his ideas about evolution He also made many inventions and predicted that electricity and aeroplanes would be useful in the future He also made a sketch of a hydrogen oxygen rocket engine in 1779

Erasmus Darwin died on the 18 April 1802 and is buried in All Saints Church Breadsall north of Derby

On April 4 1849 the New York Knickerbockers became the first team to use uniforms In 1882 different colors that showed the different fielding positions each player had were added on uniforms and stockings In 1888 and 1889 the Detroit Wolverines and Washington Nationals of the National League and the Brooklyn Bridegrooms of the American Association added stripes to their uniforms By 1900 all players in Major League Baseball teams were using uniforms

By the end of the 19th century baseball teams started wearing two different uniforms They wore one uniform when they played in their own baseball stadium and another when they played at another teams baseball stadium It became normal to wear white at home and either gray solid dark blue or black colors on the road In 1907 the Brooklyn Superbas used a blue pattern for their road uniforms The New York Giants later used a pattern almost the same as to what the Brooklyn Superbas used on their road uniforms 

In 1916 on the Giants uniforms many purple lines gave them a tartan like color At this time another kind of road uniform was a solid dark blue or black material with white In 1963 Charles O Finley changed his Kansas City Athletics home and road uniforms They were changed to the colors of gold and green In the 1970s some teams used light blue for their road uniforms

Pinstriping were created in the 19th century They were first worn on some major league baseball teams uniforms in 1907 The pinstripes were soon widened in 1912 so that people could see them more easily Pinstriping was used again when the Brooklyn Bridegrooms started to wear them in 1907 1916 and 1917 During that time when the striped uniforms were made again other things for the baseball uniform were added such as satin The team that often wore pinstripes was the New York Yankees They were first used in 1912 But the Yankees pinstripes have become a symbol of the Yankees Because of that books about the Yankees started to be made with pinstriped covers

Numbers were first added to uniforms by the Cleveland Indians in 1916 In 1929 numbers were first added on the backs of baseball uniforms by the New York Yankees and the Cleveland Indians baseball teams By the 1930s it was normal for baseball uniforms to have numbers on them The Yankees were one of the first baseball teams to wear uniform numbers This was because of their normal position in the New York Yankees batting order 

By 1932 all major league baseball teams had numbers on their players baseball uniforms The numbers were on the backs of the shirts with the team name or logo on the front But in 1952 the Brooklyn Dodgers were the first team to put numbers on the fronts of baseball uniforms As players began to have their own numbers on their uniforms retiring a number of special baseball players started to happen While testing new ideas to add to baseball uniforms new designs and ideas were created For example the Houston Astros of the 1970s and 1980s added numbers on the fronts of pockets on pants as well as on the back of their shirts

Shoulder patches on baseball uniforms were worn usually in honor of something The first patches to be used on major league uniforms were worn by the Chicago White Sox in 1907 The first patch to be worn on all 16 major league uniform sleeves in one year was in 1939 The second time patches were used in all the professional baseball teams also with the minor leagues was done in honor of the grand opening of baseballs Hall of Fame in Cooperstown New York The third patch to be worn by all teams was the rectangular Major League Baseball centennial patch in 1969 in honor of 100 years of professional baseball Many of the ballpark anniversaries have also inspired special patches to those who have recently died have been using patches rather than the traditional black arm bands of earlier decades

From the 1840s to the 1870s baseball players wore many kinds of hats such as straw hats Caps or other kinds of headgear with eye shades have been a part of baseball uniforms since they were first created In 1860 the Brooklyn Excelsiors were the first team to wear what would later become the baseball cap Before that teams often wore full brimmed straw hats or no cap at all since there was no official rule in baseball about whether players had to wear caps or not By the early 1900s rounded top parts of a hat became the normal fashion Other teams would sometimes use the flat topped cap such as the Giants in 1916 and the Pittsburgh Pirates in their 1979 World Series championship Baseball caps have changed very little in recent decades Over time a bigger sun visor has been made The reason of the cap stays the same to protect the players eyes from the sun

In the late 19th century baseball players started to wear the soft but long lasting leather shoes Soon removable spikes were designed and were used many times until 1976 when they were banned from baseball games Soon after white shoes as well as solid reds and blues became popular As artificial turf was used more in baseball fields changes to shoes were needed In the 19th and 20th centuries baseball shoes were mostly colored black The Kansas City Athletics designed new white shoes in the 1960s

The stocking colors of teams were a way of telling one team from another Stockings in 1900 were made of wool that were high in weight and were made of one piece at full length The foot covering part below the ankle bone was colored white or natural wool It often created the illusion of stirrups In 1868 the Cincinnati Red Stockings started to play in short trousers so their stockings could be seen This led to the teams nickname Teams started to be called the Chicago White Stockings or the St Louis Brown Stockings because of what colored stockings they wore at the time Some teams wore candy cane stockings instead of stripes during the 1920s these included the Giants St Louis Cardinals and Washington Senators

From the beginning graphic designs were used to tell different teams apart An Old English letter was worn on the fronts of baseball uniforms on the chest This style is still being used today by the Detroit Tigers and their Gothic style D on their home uniforms Road jerseys were able to tell the city the team it is from as with the Tigers wearing the word Detroit on their road uniform shirts meaning the teams home city is Detroit Michigan Some early examples are a small red tiger on the black cap of the uniforms of the Detroit Tigers in 1901 as they were officially the Tigers from the beginning and a bear cub logo on the Chicago Cubs uniforms by 1907 as that unofficial nickname later become the official name of the baseball club In another famous example the Boston Americans used the Nationals red stockings in 1908 since the Nationals did not use them anymore They have been called the Boston Red Sox ever since

A baseball glove is a leather glove that baseball players wear They are used to catch a baseball that are hit by a batter or thrown by an outfielder When baseball gloves were first made they were not used very much Many baseball players who first wore baseball gloves or a type of them were often teased and taunted when they were used

The first baseball glove to be worn was by catcher Doug Allison in 1870 Allisons hands were split and cracked open from catching in other games earlier in the week He decided to wear something that would protect his hands so that they would not be damaged more He got laughed and mocked at by his teammates because of his glove In 1875 five years later first baseman Charlie Waitt wore a glove for protection His teammates also laughed at him When baseball star Albert Spalding started to use baseball gloves for protection more baseball players started to do what he did also because of his fame Soon all baseball players started to wear baseball gloves

In 1920 Bill Doak a pitcher for the St Louis Cardinals asked that a web be placed between the first finger and the thumb of the glove for more protection This was because more baseball players started to have more cuts and bruises because baseballs were thrown harder This design was soon added to baseball gloves and webbed gloves were starting to be used by all baseball players In the 1940s gloves would lace the fingers together for more control using the glove The most recent idea added to baseball gloves was making the pocket of the glove deeper and finally making small baskets in the glove so that pitchers can hide their pitching grip

Baseball helmets are hard hats that baseball batters wear to protect their head from a baseball being hit or thrown at them Roger Bresnahan created the first batting helmet after getting hit in the head one game From here helmets started to be worn by more players and then players had to wear them in the seventies Usually they try to make a design the same look as the regular home cap and the same helmets are used on the road even if the soft road cap is different when looking at it Sometimes for practical reasons the batting helmets that were used around the 20th century are still being used even after it was redesigned in recent years

Baseball uniforms have changed very much from many years ago when each part of the baseball uniform was created However many parts of baseball uniforms made many years ago are still being used today For example since each part of baseball uniforms were created they improved until today such as baseball gloves that now have small pockets laced fingers and many other technologies Another example would be that very few major league baseball players wear matching colored shoes and shoes that are completely black although they did in the 19th and 20th centuries Baseball numbers on backs and fronts of uniforms are still on backs and fronts of baseball uniforms today and have been since 1932 Players last names are also on the backs of baseball uniforms today 

The cloth used on baseball uniforms are also still being used today with some improvements Often a team will have a home uniform an away uniform a Sunday game uniform uniforms that are worn only during batting practice and uniforms worn only on special events Also in recent years there has been an increase in the popularity of the throwback uniform Current Major League Baseball uniforms have to follow rules such as no advertisements on uniforms and that all players must wear their number on the back of the uniform

A Live CD Live DVD or Live Distro is a special way of creating a computer operating system so that it is able to run without installing anything on the computer first This special operating system is used when the computer is booting up and runs all its programs off the object it is put on The name of the operating system usually has something to do with the object such as Live CD for CDs Live DVD for DVDs or Live USB for USB flash drives

Distro is short for Distribution and is used because different types of Linux operating systems are called Linux Distributions and Linux Distros were the first operating systems to be made into Live CDs A Live Distro is used to refer to all different kinds of these special operating systems instead of just the ones on a certain object

The word live is used to describe the special way that the operating system is set up so that it can run on a computer without needing to install anything first

The first Linux based Live CD was Yggdrasil Linux but it did not work well because back then CD drives could not read CDs fast enough in 2003 a Live CD based on Debian called Knoppix was released Many people liked to use Knoppix both as an operating system and as a way of fixing a computer Many more people have started using Live CDs since then because of programs like Linux Live scripts and remastersys which make it very easy to make your own personalized Live CD

Some Live Distros are made to demonstrate how an operating system would work on a computer without making you install it first

Other Live Distros come with a variety of software which help fix different problems that can happen with a computer such as if they get a computer virus or if a person forgets their password

People also create Live Distros to demonstrate new ways of making operating systems or proving that an operating system can run on a new type of computer

The Cluniac Reform was a series of changes within medieval monasticism The reforms focused on restoring the traditional life in the monasteries Monasteries should encourage the production of artworks They should also care for the poor 

The reform is named after the Abbey of Cluny in Burgundy It started in the Benedictine order there The reform was largely carried out by Saint Odo It spread through France England and much of Italy and Spain 

The reform was stated because there was corruption in the Benedictine order People thought this corruption came because people that were not priests and that came from outside the monasteries interfered with them A Benetictine monastery needed land This land was given by a Feudal lord By giving the land the lord would become the patron of the monastery However he would often demand the right to interfere in the business of the monastery The Cluny reform was an attempt to change this practice A more independent abbot would have better success at enforcing the Rule of the order it was thought William of Aquitaine formed the first Cluny monastery in 910 with the novel stipulation that the monastery would report directly to the pope rather than to a local lord This meant essentially that the monastery would be independent since the popes authority was largely theoretical at that distance  

During its height the Cluniac movement was one of the largest religious forces in Europe Among the most notable reform supporters were Pope Urban II Lambert of Hersfeld and Abbot Richard of Saint Vannes at Verdun The Cluniacs were supporters of the Peace of God concept as well as pilgrimages to the Holy Lands
