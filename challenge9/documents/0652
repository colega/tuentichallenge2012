Housecleaning is getting rid of mess trash dirt and unclean actions so a household is better looking Tools and ways that work could be used for it A reason people houseclean is to be able to see parts of the floor and furniture otherwise hidden by clutter Other reasons are to keep from getting spider bites or breathing problems from dust People may sweep and vacuum when housecleaning They can also hang up clothes do the laundry and wash windows Soaking up spilled red wine is another example of cleaning a mess in a house Washing a sponge squeezing it out and placing it on a dish rack to dry are a part of housecleaning When used as a big word housecleaning is making a group of people be good

Clutter is too many things in the house It is because the things have not been put away or because there is nowhere to put them or both Places people put things away are shelves drawers and hangers When those storage places are messy or too full they are cluttered They could be made clean and neat instead A classic example of clutter is a hall closet with ten years of old boots coats and mittens piled on the floor A workbench covered with tools is cluttered So is a garage so messy it has no room for the car Books left out and coats on the backs of chairs are clutter Old school work and old magazines are clutter Collections of old pizza boxes and soft drink bottles are both trash and clutter Packrat style clutter includes things such as a freezer full of meat too many paintings old lawnmowers unused snowmobiles inherited dishes and extra furniture While some clutter is wealth broken clutter may not be if disorganized A crowded or messy collection of belongings gets in the way of walking viewing or using things Clutter left out makes it harder to dust and vacuum People sometimes decide to get rid of clutter They do this by putting things away If they do not have enough places to put everything away neatly they sell give away or throw away things they do not want any more For example if the refrigerator is too full they throw the spoiled food away If the kitchen cabinets are too full of junk they might agree to throw some of that away Getting rid of clutter has been called de cluttering Organized storage includes keeping objects together based on what they do and where they are used People put labels on boxes in the attic for example Out of season clothes might be stored in the attic The well organized household may even have maps or lists of where things are People report taking weeks to de clutter They decide what to keep They decide where to store things People sometimes sell old things at consignment shops Some people have yard or garage sales People also donate old things to charities that take them By the time two yeas has gone by some people have all new clothes For example they throw away their old running shoes rather than bronzing them  

Germs are tiny bugs which make people sick They are too small to see without a microscope Some bottles of soap and water that are sold in stores come with poison in them People wipe these disinfectant cleaners on the tub or other surface and then let them evaporate until the surface is dry They then rinse the soap and poison off the surface Disinfectant cleaners are used to keep people from getting Athletes foot and the Flu To keep the house and the world safe people do not use too much disinfectant cleaner Some kinds of soap can hurt people just because of how strong they are People do not use those cleaners unless they really need to use them Ways people get rid of germs include the following After meat has touched a cutting board they wash the cutting board After cleaning with a dish cloth or sponge they wash the dishcloth or sponge They then squeeze it out and put it on the dish rack to get dry If a sponge is dry no mold will grow on it and no slime or stink will happen If a dishcloth or sponge gets mold or slime or stink people throw it into the trash They get a new sponge or dishcloth People wash dishes right after meals to make cleaning easier and the kitchen cleaner They take the kitchen trash outside and put it into a garbage can Little flies rotten smell and no more room in the kitchen trash basket may be why The box or bottle a soap like cleaner comes in has a label with directions on it People read the directions to make sure they know how to safely use the cleaner Some cleaners are very dangerous because they contain acid bleach or something else harmful The label might say to wear goggles or rubber gloves It might say to open the windows for fresh air People store bottles and boxes of cleaner in their original containers to know what they are and to be able to re read the directions on them They never mix cleaners This is to prevent accidents and harmful chemical reactions Mixing two different kinds of cleaner could result in a mixture that is unable to clean or could cause something dangerous to happen For example mixing bleach and ammonia together causes very poison fumes to fill the air Spot remover drain cleaner floor wax grease remover and paint thinner are examples of volatile cleaners Fans are turned on and windows are kept open while using cleaners with fumes People never wear contact lenses or eat or drink or smoke while using dangerous cleaners When using limestone remover toilet bowl cleaner or oven cleaner people work slowly enough to be careful and not get any acid on themselves Using dangerous cleaners they wear rubber gloves goggles cleaning clothes and they pay attention to what they are doing They keep the bottle of cleaner closed as much as possible They are watchful and keep dangerous buckets spray cans boxes of floor soap and so forth away from young children and pets In fact people read the label before deciding to buy a cleaner

Green cleaning is cleaning done with as little harm to the world as possible For example green housecleaners never pour paint thinner down the drain Also they never throw away or pour extra paint or motor oil down the drain They save it or they give it to someone who wants to use it This is because oil paint paint thinner and other things pass through septic tanks and sewage treatment plants without being made safe Also too much bleach acid disinfectant and so forth could poison the water in wells rivers and lakes Green cleaners try not to buy cleaner that is too strong for the job to be done They also try not to use more than is needed People take care of the outdoors For example scientists made detergent more like soap so the detergent bubbles on rivers would go away Soap and detergent are kinds of cleaner People use the weakest cleaner that works The strong cleaners melt stone damage metal make toxic fumes contain poison and burn skin People use the mild cleaners for safety For example a sponge damp with warm water cleans counters just fine If not half a drop of dish soap is squeezed into the wet sponge People clean before a strong cleaner is needed Drying washed hands on cloth towels saves paper towels Running a full dishwasher instead of a half empty dishwasher lowers the amount of detergent arriving at the septic tank or treatment plant and increases the workout from putting the dishes away To make room for a new box or bottle of cleaner people use up old cleaner over a long period of time Some people use leftover vinegar salt baking soda and olive oil to clean with

Dust could make a guest sneeze cough and get watery eyes Dust could give someone a rash and trouble breathing The dust could be made of smoke cotton soap particles pollen mold spores dry cat spit spider web remains fur tiny skin flakes textile and insect fibers food particles mold spores unusual smells or something the guest is allergic to People vacuum dust They wipe dust away with a cloth They shampoo and vacuum their carpets and sofa They vacuum mattresses They wash some things in the kitchen sink They vacuum or launder or dry clean stuffed animals They brush dust from cracks They scrub black mold from showers They wash their dogs and cats Some people wear dust masks while vacuuming dusty rooms They put a towel on their sofa for their cat Some have central air conditioning to keep dust out of their house Some replace their wall to wall carpet with hardwood floors and vacuum under their rugs

There are five main kinds of cleaning chemicals 1 Surfactants make water able to get things wet faster 2 Alkaline chemicals like soap and baking soda are able to get things like mud and hamburger grease off 3 Acidic chemicals like vinegar and orange juice are able to get off things like mustard wine tea coffee rust dry soap suds and lime scale 4 Flammable solvents like turpentine are able to remove things like paint 5 Disinfectants kill germs like fungus and mold The chemicals are put in cleaners Soap is a kind of cleaner Some cleaners are so alkaline or acidic they are more dangerous than others Some cleaners are liquid Some are dry Some are in between Some pour out of box or bottle Some are sprayed Some are wrapped in paper or are taken out of a box There are all purpose cleaners for washing things like tubs trash cans counter tops floors door frames stoves toasters and refrigerators There are also one purpose cleaners Examples are limestone remover toilet bowl cleaner drain opener glass cleaner metal polish shower room disinfectant tub tile and sink cleaner rug cleaner dusting spray furniture polish and kitchen floor cleaner

People buy knowledgeable books on cleaning to look things up in as needed They also read the directions on the boxes and bottles of cleaner and the directions that come with tools People carry some cleaners and tools in a cleaning kit which is sometimes called a bucket caddy or basket They carry them from the closet or utility room where the cleaners and tools are stored to where they are used After they use the cleaning tools they clean them For example they rinse and squeeze sponges and mops and rinse out buckets They wash cleaning towels They wash cleaning clothing They dust the vacuum cleaner and when its paper bag is full they put in a new one They then put the cleaners and tools back where they are kept Cleaning tools are used in the best order to clean without wasting time The saying is Use the right tool for the right job Knowledgeable books tell what people have found out and invented Safety glasses and rubber gloves might be needed People do general cleaning before reading about shabby things like a pen mark or coffee stain Because people do not always look forward to the exercise of cleaning tools that make cleaning easier help make them feel more like cleaning Many people rent machines like carpet cleaners Some cleaning tools are the following tote bag trash bag dish tray whisk broom dust pan vacuum cleaner dust cloth stepladder window towel laundry bags washing machine dryer laundry basket dish washer sponge towels bucket mop rubber gloves tub brush and toilet swab

King Minos was a very powerful king in ancient Greece He once had a wife named Pasophae King Minos upset the gods by cheating them in a sacrifice He told Poseidon that he would sacrifice a beautiful bull that Poseidon gave him after he used it Instead he switched it with another bull They punished him by having Pasphae fall in love with a bull

Pasophae asked Daedelus to help her so Daedelus made a mechanical bull suit for her and she got into it and had a child It was the Minotaur half human half bull 

King Minos took the Minotaur and put it in a labrynth or maze built by Daedelus When he was in possession of all of Crete he ordered that fourteen younglings come to him to be sacrificed to the Minotaur The kings son volunteered to be one of them and went there with daughter Ariadne He killed the Minotaur in the labyrinth

After his death King Minos became one of the judges of the dead in the underworld

The Paso doble is a dance and music based on the Spanish bullfight It is the music played at bullfights at the procession of the bullfighters between stages and at the end of each session The dance is based on the way matadors perform in the ring

In the dance the man takes the part of the matador and the woman takes the part of the mans cape The mans stance should be proud and when he has a free arm it should be held slightly bent rather as matadors do The photograph of the ice dancers gives a perfect example of what dancers should aim for in this style

The paso doble is one of the five International Latin ballroom dances It gives a very good contrast in style with the four other dances Although so Spanish in style and origin the dance techniques were first developed in Paris Later in mid 20th century London the Latin and American dances took on their present form

The music is scored in 24 time It is a march like type of music and as a dance it is a two step It is played at about 6062 bars a minute for dancers

The most famous piece of paso doble music is the Espaa Ca or Spanish Gypsy Dance A sample of La Gracia de Dios gives an idea of the rhythm

Daedalus was King Minos head archietct in ancient Greece When King Minos of Crete was having some sovereignty problems he asked Poseidon god of the sea for an offering to sacrifice to him as a sign as true kingship So Poseidon sent a snow white bull straight out of the sea foam Once the people of Crete saw the bull they all agreed that it was a sign of true kingship However once King Minos saw the bull he refused to sacrifice the bull kept it for himself and sacrificed another bull to Poseidon thus angering him Poseidon put a curse on Minos wife making her fall in love with the bull She loved it so much that she wanted to mate with it Minos called for the help of Daedalus who built a wooden bull and put Queen Pasiphae inside it thus calming her anxiety for mating with the bull She soon became pregnant with half man half bull Also called the Minotaur 

King Minos was horrified and asked Daedalus to build some kind of prison to keep the Minotaur from destroying Crete So Daedalus built a labyrinth that was so complicated that the Minotaur could not get out Only Daedalus knew the course of the labyrinth Minos was afraid that Daedalus would tell the route through the labyrinth and that he would tell that the Minotaur was the son of Minos wife he imprisoned Daedalus and his son Icarus in a high tower Daedalus made some wings that he strapped to his and Icarus arms and together they escaped from the tower However Icarus forgetting his fathers words flew too close to the sun and the wax that held the feathers together melted Icarus fell into the ocean and drowned Daedalus landed safely on an island and in grief he named the sea that he and Icarus had flown across the Icarian Sea

Pentateuch means the first five books of the Bible These books are Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers and Deuteronomy The word Pentateuch comes from two Greek words that mean five books or five scrolls

According to tradition the books were written by the Israelite leader Moses The Pentateuch is often called the Five Books of Moses or the Torah

The Pentateuch tells the story from the Creation of the world to the death of Moses and the preparation of the Israelites to enter the land of Canaan The story is told in three parts The first part is about the Creation and the beginning of human beings on earth The second part are the stories of the ancestors of the Israelites mainly Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph The third part beginning with the book of Exodus describes how the Israelites left Egypt and the early history of the people of Israel as a nation It also has many laws about how the Israelites must build their society Deuteronomy is mostly Mosess final speech to his people and a summary of the Pentateuch

Death and Adjustment Hypotheses is a pair of theory on the phenomenon of death and death anxiety It is used in adult human development study in psychiatry spiritual psychiatry and scientific thanatology 

The theory was formally postulated in full and for the first time in 2007 in the book Quest for a New Death by Mohammad Samir Hossain The same researcher explained the theory further in a second work named Human Immortality in 2008 They were reviewed by the journal Death Studies the Royal College of Psychiatrists at London the Scientific and Medical Network and others The Royal College of Psychiatrists at London and the Journal of Loss and Trauma published scientific articles on the theory

Inner message of the theory According to this theory a moral life can give us the clearest perception of death Changes in our materialistic attitude are necessary to establish such a moral life It can be a potential remedy to many of the prevailing problems we face including in the sphere of mental health to speak out against the rising materialism of modern society Only then can we contemplate without fear our true death which is supposedly the end of the perceivable part of our existence but not necessarily of the whole of it

Death and Adjustment Hypothesis 1 In the absence of empirical evidence from science to regard death as not our absolute end seems natural and is an epistemologically sound point of view

Death and Adjustment Hypothesis 2 Changing our materialistic view to a moral one on life can help eradicate the social denial of death through the establishment of a sound concept of death which should also enhance our adjustment to the phenomenon

The Quickstep is an International Style ballroom dance that follows a 44 time beat at about 50 bars per minutep62 From its early beginning as a faster Foxtrot the Quickstep has become quite different It is danced to the fastest tempo of the ballroom dances

The Quickstep developed in the 1920s from a combination of the Foxtrot the Charleston and other dances The dance is English in origin and was standardized in 1927 Although it came from the Foxtrot the Quickstep now is quite separate Unlike the modern Foxtrot the feet often close and syncopated steps occur often Three characteristic dance figures of the Quickstep are the chasss where the feet come together the quarter turns and the lock stepp126

This dance became a very dynamic one with a lot of movement on the dance floor with many advanced patterns including hops runs quick steps with a lot of momentum and rotation The tempo of Quickstep dance is rather brisk as it was developed to ragtime era jazz music which was fast paced compared to other dance music

Today the complexity of Quickstep as done by competition dancers has increased They use more syncopated steps While in older times quickstep patterns were counted with quick and slow steps many advanced patterns today are cued with split beats such as quick and quick and quick quick slow with there being further steps on the ands

Tracking is the method of placing students according to their ability level in homogeneous classes or learning experiences Students of different abilities are assigned to different tracks of courses and programs Tracking is the term given to this process and while some teachers believe that tracking makes instruction more manageable others believe that it is a terribly flawed system Once a student is placed it may be very difficult to move up from one track to another The placements may reflect racism classism or sexism Many educators charge that the United States relies more on tracking than any other nation in the world Most schools today work hard to avoid using the term tracking Middle and high schools are taking their cue from elementary schools where ability grouping has been in favor Ability grouping sorts students based on capability but the groupings may well vary by subject While tracks suggest permanence ability grouping is more transitory One year a student might find herself in a high ability math group and a low ability English group The following year that same student might be reassigned to a new set of groups School tracking is a reality functioning under an assumed identity called ability grouping 

Besides tracking another way to deal with diversity is to integrate students of different ability levels together in small working groups Cooperative learning gives students a sense of pride for both their individual performance and that of the group The students begin to take responsibility for their learning rather than on the teacher Cooperative learning allows higher achievement in many students and has eased tensions in multicultural classrooms as students learn to work together

Monsieur Pierre or simply Pierre was the professional name of Pierre Jean Phillipe Zurcher Margolle Pierre was a professional dancer and dance teacher he was a Fellow Examiner and committee member of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing and a Member of the Official Board of Ballroom Dancing

Pierre was the main person responsible for introducing the Latin American dances to England He set them up for use in competitions and in social dance The system he and his colleagues developed became the basis for all Latin American competitions held under the World Dance Council

After World War I ended in 1918 he started on a career as a professional ballroom dancer in London Although he spent the rest of his life resident in London Pierre never gave up his French citizenship

The rhythms which make Latin American dance popular were brought to Britain between the two World Wars Pierre was already an accomplished dancer and teacher in the English ballroom style In Latin dances his repertoire first consisted of the Argentine tango the Paso doble and the Samba

By the 1930s Pierre had moved more towards the Latin American dances and in 1934 his full page trade adverts featured the rumba The studio stayed open all through World War II and was a popular meeting place for the Free French fighters on leave in London Pierres studio always played authentic music for its LA dance instruction

Originally Pierre had visited Paris to find out how their dancers and teachers dealt with the rumba But after the war in 1947 Pierre visited Cuba where he discovered to his surprise that the Cubans danced it differently When he was there he danced at the acadamias every night After this he returned to London determined to teach the Cuban rumba sistema cubano To this end Pierre wrote the first account of his ideas on the rumba as a dance

One of the characteristics of Cuban dance to the Son and other similar rhythms was and still is their method of taking three steps to four beats of music The Cuban rumba figure starts on beat 2 counting 2 3 4 1 as quick quick slow with the hip settling over the standing foot on 4 1 

All social dances in Cuba involve a hip sway over the standing leg and though this is scarcely noticeable in fast salsa it is more pronounced in the slow ballroom rumba In general steps are kept compact and the dance is without any rise and fall The argument in favour of this method was authenticity and also satisfaction at the dance effect the Cuban style achieved 

The Latin and American section of the ISTD Ballroom Branch was formed in 1947 by Monsieur Pierre as Chairman The syllabus finally agreed in 1955 has been the foundation of teaching and competition in the Latin American dances ever since This work naturally included the Samba Paso doble and Jive as well After further visits to Cuba in the early 1950s when Doris Lavelle and James Arnell accompanied Pierre the Cha cha cha was added to make the five Latin American dances which are still the basis of teaching and competition today

On Pierres death in 1963 his colleague Doris Nichols commented The Latin American dancing world was so influenced fostered and built up by him that the names of Pierre and Latin American became virtually synonymous

However by the 6th century AD Western performing arts had been largely ended as the Dark Ages began Between the 9th century and 14th century performing art in the West was limited to religious historical enactments and morality plays organized by the Church in celebration of holy days and other important events

Albert Charles Paul Marie Roussel was a French composer Roussel spent seven years as a midshipman He only turned to music as an adult But he then became one of the most unique French composers of the inter war time His earlier music came from the impressionism of Debussy and Ravel He turned more towards neoclassicism with his later music

Albert was born in Tourcoing Roussels earliest interest was not music It was mathematics He spent some time in the French Navy In 1889 and 1890 he served on the crew of the frigate Iphignie These travels made him more like an artist This is because many of his musical works would reflect his interest in far off and interesting places

After Roussel stopped working with the Navy in 1894 he began to study music with Eugne Gigout Albert continued his studies until 1908 at the Schola Cantorum While he studied he would also also teach His fellow students were Erik Satie and the young Edgard Varse

During World War I he served as an ambulance driver on the Western Front After the war he bought a summer house in Normandy This is where he gave most of his time to composing music

Roussel was a classicist Some of his first works are very much like impressionism But he soon found a style fit just for him This style was more normal in design It had a strong rhythmic sound It also seemed to be more like functional tonality than is clear in the work of his more famous works 

The Schola Cantorum left a mark on Roussels mature style Compared with the style of other French composers like Gabriel Faur or Claude Debussy Roussels orchestration is kind of heavy His style and musical beauty of so called French music was his own No one else really had it Roussel never copied any of the Teutonic style

Roussel also liked jazz He wrote a piano vocal composition called Jazz dans la nuit This is almost the same by its inspiration to other jazz works such as Blues second movement of Maurice Ravels Violin Sonata 

Roussels most important works are the ballets They are Le festin de laraigne Bacchus et Ariane and Aeneas Other good works are the four symphonies His other works are manys ballets a piano concerto a concertino for cello and orchestra a psalm setting for chorus and orchestra minor music for the theater solo piano music and songs He died in the town of Royan in western France in 1937 That is the same year that his countrymen Maurice Ravel and Gabriel Piern died

Arturo Toscanini included the suite from the ballet Le festin de laraigne in one of his concerts with the NBC Symphony Orchestra Georges Prtre recorded this same music with the Orchestre National de France for EMI in 1984

A veil is a soft covering of all or part of the face It has often been used by women in many cultures It is often used by brides on their wedding day It may have religious meaning or it may be used for pleasure or dance It is different from a mask because a mask is close fitting and often firm or hard while a veil is soft and may fit loosely

Veils are a kind of non verbal communication They always have some kind of unspoken message

Some kinds of veil include a hood which covers the entire head like a hijab The point of covering the head entirely is to cover all parts which have any sexual meaning A womans hair is one of her secondary sexual characteristics and acts to attract the opposite sex Some religious groups believe that female sexuality should not be shown in public

The most important part of the head is the face because the human face takes part in communication Covering it says in effect this person is not available That is why it has been used so often by women Because it is of soft material the veil may be lifted back over the head or unclipped from one side This is also a signal It says now I am available So brides lift their veil at the point when they are married

Veils may be and often are partly transparent This adds ambiguity and mystery to the message it offers the viewer it is a fashion statement The raising or dropping of veils is a sign of intimacy the wearer who was covered is now in the open Extreme example Salome and the dance of the seven veils

French Island is a large island located in Western Port Victoria Australia It is 61 km southeast of Melbourne In 1997 about 70 per cent of the island was made the French Island National Park It has also been listed as part of the National Estate In 2002 the waters on the north coast were made into the French Island Marine National Park

Even though it is close to Melbourne French Island is relatively isolated and undeveloped There is no water or electricity supply or medical services on the island There is one small shop and post office on Tankerton Road about 3 km from Tankerton Jetty There is a number of places to stay including camping bed and breakfasts guest houses and the McLeod Eco Farm which was once a prison

An Australian aboriginal tribal song says the Bunarong Tribe lived and hunted on French Island until they were killed by a warring Gippsland tribeFactdateJune 2009 The first Europeans to discover the island were the French in April 1802 A group from the ship La Naturaliste explored the area naming it le de Franoise In 1847 the first settlers William and John Gardner started farming on the island In the 1880s koalas were released on to the island In the 1890s the government set up several small villages Farmers began to grow chicory and about 30 chicory kilns were built

On July 17 1916 the McLeod Prison Farm opened and continued until 1975 In 1967 the State Electricity Commissionwanted to build the first nuclear power plant in Australia on French Island

Tankerton Post Office opened on 3 September 1890 and closed in 1994 It reopened in 2001 under the name French Island A Fairhaven office was also open from 1911 until 1957

In 1967 the SEC told the Lands Department to keep 400 acres of French Island for future construction of a nuclear power plant The plant to be built in the 1970s would generate 350 500MW of electricity More nuclear power plants would be built in Australia once there was a successful fully operational plant in Victoria The SEC also planned to build more brown coal power stations as well

Due to the low cost of brown coal in Victoria and pressure from the anti nuclear movement the SEC decided not to build a nuclear plant and instead continued to build brown coal plants These included the Hazelwood Power Station which was completed in 1971 Nuclear plants were not built in New South Wales as access to black coal allowed for bigger generators The declaration of various areas of many Australian states as nuclear free zones was a key factor in the selection of coal plants over nuclear plants

There is easy access to the island by train and ferry People can take a train from Melbourne to Frankston From Frankston there is a diesel locomotive service to Stony Point It is a short walk along the jetty to catch the passenger ferry to Tankerton jetty on French Island It is also possible to catch a passenger ferry from Cowes on Phillip Island

Important features are Mount Wellington which is 96m in height and the Pinnacles at 66m

In 2006 there were 89 people living on French Island In 2009there were five students at the primary school 

Habitats range from coastal mangroves swamps heath grasslands and blue gum forests Most koalas on the mainland of Australia suffer from the chlamydia disease French Island provides the worlds most dense and disease free group of koalas They are often moved to repopulate diseased areas on the mainland Shelter is provided for more than 100 species of bush orchids and 260 species of birds Significant species on the island include King Quail the critically endangered Orange bellied Parrot Fairy Tern White bellied Sea Eagle Swamp Skink Long nosed Potoroo The island is one of only two places in Victoria where there are no foxes Because of this the island has kept a variety of native species which have been devastated by the fox in other areas However rabbits feral cats feral goats feral pigs Indian Mynahs and starlings pose a threat to the islands biodiversity

As the only cars used on the island are by residents the network of more than 40 km of gravel roads and tracks are quiet and ideal for cycling The island is generally flat or mildly undulating with the highest point being Mt Wellington Bicycles can be hired from the General Store Macleod Eco Farm and Bayview There are many walking tracks Other activities include bushwalking bird watching horse riding cycling and as a base for deep sea fishing 

Two local tour companies French Island Tours and French Island Eco Tours can provide bus tours of the island

There is one free camping site in the National Park at Fairhaven 4 km up the coast road from Tankerton Jetty where the ferry arrives from Stony Point The camp site is set among trees near the beach with one public toilet and a water tank Other camping is available at private sites at Bayview and McLeod Eco Farm by arrangement

Keynesian economics describes the economics theories from famous economist John Maynard Keynes

Keynes believed that capitalism was a good economic system but sometimes when the economy becomes bad the government should step in and do something about it 

These are called demand side policies

When the economy is bad people tend to save their money instead of spend it and in result there is less economic activity 

Keynes believed that the government should spend a lot of money to create jobs for unemployed people and then those people would spend their money which would create more jobs and get the economys motor running again

Some people such as conservatives libertarians and people who believe in Austrian economics are against Keynesian economics because they believe the economy can recover on its own without government intervention

During the late 1970s Keynesian economics became less popular because inflation was high 

When a big recession happened in 2007 Keynesian economics became more popular Leaders around the world created stimulus packages which would allow their government to spend a lot of money to create jobs

Elam was an long lasting ancient civilization just to the east of Mesopotamia in what is now southwest Iran Elam was centered in the far west and the southwest of modern day Iran including a small part of southern Iraq

Knowledge of Elamite history remains largely fragmentary reconstruction being based on mainly Mesopotamian sources The history of Elam is conventionally divided into three periods spanning more than two millennia The period before the first Elamite period is known as the proto Elamite period

The Proto Elamite city of Susa was founded around 5000 BCE in the watershed of the river Karun It is considered to be the site of Proto Elamite cultural formation 

Written records start from around 3000 BC in the Old Elamite period In the Achaemenid Empire the Elamite language was among those in official use The Elamite language has no obvious connections with any other and seems to be a language isolate like Sumerian Some researchers have suggested the existence of a larger group known as Elamo Dravidian This theory is not established

The Elamites called their country Haltamti but the Sumerians and Akkadians called it Elam and so it was also in the Hebrew Bible The civilisation started around 2700 BC and they were finally conquered by the Achmaenids in 640 BC A tablet found in 1848 has the Achmaenid king Ashurbanipal boasting of his conquest

As it happens the Elamites managed to stay independent for some time after this disaster The devastation was less complete than Assurbanipal boasted and Elamite rule though rather broken up continued until 540 BC when Achaemenid rule begins in Susa Under the Parthian period a kingdom of Elymais existed which survived until its extinction by Sassanid invasion in the early third century AD It was located in the heartland of ancient Elam

The wings of most damselflies are held along and parallel to the body when at rest There are also damselfly families in which the wings are held open as in the true dragonflies 

Damselflies are also usually smaller weaker fliers than dragonflies and their eyes are well separated by more than their own diameter Another distinction is that their forewings and hindwings look similar this is not the case in the true dragonflies

Like dragonflies damselflies can only land but not walk Their life cycle is also similar They have incomplete metamorphosis with an aquatic nymph which is carnivorous

Rumba is a music and dance term with two different meanings

First it means Cuban event of African style the rumba genre of Afro Cuban music This use of the term rumba is quite different from the Latin ballroom dance

Second it refers to one of the Latin ballroom dances In this sense the Rumba is the slowest of the five competitive International Latin dances The Paso doble the Samba the Cha cha cha and the Jive are the others This ballroom Rumba was also danced in Cuba to a rhythm they call the bolero son The international style was derived from studies of dance in Cuba in the pre revolutionary period

The Peanut Vendor was the first recording of Cuban music to become an international hit It was described on the label as a rumba perhaps because the word son would not be understood in English The label stuck and a rumba craze developed through the 1930s This kind of rumba was introduced into dance salons in America and Europe in the 1930s and was characterized by variable tempo sometimes nearly twice as fast as the modern ballroom Rumba

The modern style of dancing the Rumba derives from studies made by dance teacher Monsieur Pierre Pierre then from London visited Cuba in 1947 1951 and 1953 to find out how and what Cubans were dancing at the timeIntro 

The international ballroom Rumba is a slower dance of about 120 beats per minute which corresponds both in music and in dance to what the Cubans of an older generation called the bolero son It is easy to see why for ease of reference and for marketing rumba is a better name however inaccurate It is the same kind of reason that led later on to the use of salsa as an overall term for popular music of Cuban origin

All social dances in Cuba involve a hip sway over the standing leg and though this is hardly noticeable in fast salsa it is more pronounced in the slow ballroom rumba Walter Laird put it like this

In general steps are kept compact and the dance is danced without any rise and fall This style is authentic as is the use of free arms in various figures The basic figures derive from dance moves observed in Havana in the pre revolutionary period and have developed their own life since then Competition figures are often complex and this is where competition dance separates from social dance Details can be obtained from the syllabi of dance teaching organizations and from standard texts

Bullfighting is an old sport Today it is mostly done in Spain and in Portugal and some countries of South America

The Spanish bullfight is a fight to the death The modern bullfight has a ritual It has three distinct stages the start of each being signalled by a trumpet The bullfighters enter the arena in a parade to Paso doble music 

A team of bullfighters is seven men The leader is the matador and he has six assistants who play roles in the drama Bullfighters costumes are inspired by 18th century Andalusian clothing Matadores are easily seen by the gold of their traje de luces

At the end comes the tercio de muerte The matador re enters the ring alone with a small red cape and a sword The cape called a muleta The matador uses his cape to attract the bull in a series of passes The faena is the performance with the cape The faena ends with a final series of passes in which the bullfighter tries to move the bull into position He then stabs it between the shoulder blades and through the aorta or heart The act of thrusting in the sword is called an estocada

If the matador gets it wrong he may be gored by the bulls horns and killed This does happen some very famous matadors have died in the ring When the great matador Manolete was killed in the ring at the age of 31 three days of official national mourning were held Bullrings do have an infirmary with an operating room for the immediate treatment of bullfighters with horn wounds

There is great opposition to the bullfight from animal welfare organisations There are also versions of the bullfight in which the animal is unharmed

 Ice algae and snow algae are algae and cyanobacteria which grow on snow and ice fields They may color the snow and ice green or red during the summer months The red color is a protection against the ultraviolet radiation of the sun which causes mutations Without it the algae would suffer chromosome breaks and DNA mutations

There are ice algal communities on sea ice The algae are important in Polar ecosystems because they provide food for krill Krill scrape off the algae from the underside of the ice which is colored green by the algae The algae may be found between ice crystals or attached to them in the water or saltwater channels between ice crystals 

Chlamydomonas nivalis is a green alga which causes Watermelon snow

Watermelon snow is snow that is reddish or pink in color and that has a smell similar to a fresh watermelon This type of snow is common during the summer in alpine and coastal polar regions such as the Sierra Nevada of California Here at altitudes of 10000 to 12000 feet the temperature is cold throughout the year and so the snow lingers from winter storms When someone steps on the snow the footprints look red 

Chlamydomonas nivalis is a green alga which owes its red color to a bright red carotenoid pigment This protects the chloroplast and cell nucleus from strong visible and ultraviolet radiation The green and red pigments absorb light and heat which gives the alga liquid water as the snow melts around it Algal blooms may go 25 cm deep Since each cell measures 20 to 30 micrometers in diameter a teaspoon of melted snow contains a million or more cells The algae build up in sun cups which are shallow depressions in the snow The carotenoid pigment absorbs heat which deepens the sun cups and makes the glaciers and snowbanks melt faster

During the winter months when snow covers them the algae become dormant In spring nutrients increased levels of light and meltwater stimulate germination Once they germinate the resting cells release smaller green flagellate cells which travel towards the surface of the snow Once the flagellated cells reach the surface they may lose their flagellae and form thick walled resting cells or they may function as gametes fusing in pairs to form zygotes

Many species feed on C nivalis including protozoans such as ciliates rotifers nematodes ice worms and springtails

The first accounts of watermelon snow are in the writings of Aristotle Watermelon snow has puzzled mountain climbers explorers and naturalists for thousands of years

In May 1818 four ships sailed from England to search for the Northwest Passage and chart the Arctic coastline of North America Bad weather made them finally turn the ships back but the expedition made important contributions to science Captain John Ross noticed crimson snow that streaked the white cliffs like streams of blood as they were rounding Cape York on the northwest coast of Greenland A landing party stopped and brought back samples to England The Times wrote about this discovery on December 4 1818

When Ross published his story of the voyage in 1818 the story had an appendix of plants by Robert Brown In it Brown compared the red snow to an alga

Scuderia Toro Rosso or just Toro Rosso is one of two Formula One teams owned by Austrian beverage company Red Bull The other team is Red Bull Racing Toro Rosso ran its first race in the F12006 season 

Toro Rosso is the sister team of Red Bull Racing The goal is to use Toro Rosso to develop the skills of promising drivers for the Red Bull Racing Vitantonio Liuzzi scored Roro Rossos first point in its first season at the F12006 United States Grand Prix The teams first pole position and victory were scored by Sebastian Vettel at the F12008 Italian Grand Prix

For the F12007 f12008 f12009 and f12010 seasons Toro Rosso used Ferrari engines Toro Rosso started using the Ferrari engines when Red Bull Racing switched from Ferrari to Renault engines Its F12009 car the Toro Rosso STR4 was nearly identical to the Red Bull RB5 Both cars were designed by Adrian Newey

Minardi had competed in Formula One from 1985 to 2005 Minardi had a large fan base but they were one of the least competitive teams in the sport The main reason for their lack of performance was a relatively small budget Minardi owner Paul Stoddart said he had 41 offers to buy the team Stoddart preferred to sell the team to someone who could take it further than he could He also wanted an owner who would maintain the team in its traditional base in Italy The terms of the deal with Red Bull included a requirement that the team must keep in Faenza Italy until at least the F12007 season

Red Bull decided to changed the Minardi name because of their sponsorship and marketing plans Red Bull used the Italian language in the new name to hint at the teams Italian heritage Red Bull changed the name of the team after taking control of the team to Scuderia Toro Rosso

Vitantonio Liuzzi and Scott Speed were the F12006 race drivers with Neel Jani filling the testthird driver role Liuzzi had raced part time for Red Bull Racing in F12005 while Speed entered F1 following the Red Bull Driver Search in the United States Jani was the test driver for Sauber Petronas in F12004

The 2006 Toro Rosso chassis was a modified version of the 2005 Red Bull Racing RB1 Some teams felt that this infringed the rule that each team must design their own car Toro Rosso claim that this design was first produced during F12004 by Jaguar Racing Red Bulls predecessor They believed that the design rights had belonged to the Ford Motor Company Jaguar Racings parent company before passing to Toro Rosso

The new Formula One regulations for 2006 required new V8 engines Toro Rosso was allowed to used Minardis supply of power limited Cosworth 3 liter V10 engines This option had been created to assist the less funded teams the expense of building new engines Formula One allowing Toro Rosso to use this option after the Red Bull takeover caused friction with other teams in particular Super Aguri and Midland These teams felt that the engine gave Toro Rosso too much of an advantage They relived that the concession to allow the team use the V10 engine was based on Minardis poor financial situation and should not have apply after the team was purchased by Red Bull

 For the F12007 season Toro Rosso began using the Ferrari 056 V8 engine taking over the contract that Red Bull Racing broke from by switching to Renault engines

At the launch of the STR2 on 13 February Gerhard Berger confirmed Liuzzi as a F12007 driver In testing in Bahrain on 24 February Scott Speed was confirmed as the teams second driver Three time Champ Car champion Sbastien Bourdais was the unofficial test driver several times during the season

The 2007 season was generally disappointing The team suffered poor reliability and driver errors that lead to a low number of race finishes Following the European Grand Prix Scott Speed was removed as a driver He was replaced by BMW Sauber development driver Sebastian Vettel Vettel was later confirmed as a driver for F12008

At the Chinese Grand Prix Toro Rosso scored their best results Vettel finishing fourth and Liuzzi sixth scoring eight points for the team These were also the drivers best finishes in Formula One It was a big improvement over the preceding race At the Japanese Grand Prix Vettel crashed into Mark Webbers Red Bull under safety car conditions Webber was running in second place and Vettel was in third place Liuzzi lost the possibility of scoring a point after a 25 second penalty He was penalized for passing Adrian Sutils Spyker for eighth place under a local yellow flag condition The penalty dropped him to ninth place

Scuderia Toro Rossos drivers for F12008 were Sebastian Vettel and Sbastien Bourdais Bourdais earned his first points in F1 with a 7th place finish at the Australian Grand Prix Vettel scored his first points of the season with a 5th place finish at the Monaco Grand Prix 

The team pulled off a massive shock at the wet Italian Grand Prix Vettel claiming a pole position and won the race It was the first pole and win for both himself and Toro Rosso This was also the first win for a Ferrari engine in a customer chassis Vettels performances earned him a place at Red Bull Racing for F12009

 With Vettel moving to Red Bull Racing Sbastien Buemi and Sbastien Bourdais were the Toro Rosso drivers for F12009 Before the season started the teams boss Franz Tost said that it would be difficult to do as well as they did in the 2008 season On 16 July Toro Rosso announced that Bourdais contract was terminated On 20 July the team announced that Jaime Alguersuari will replace Bourdais starting with the Hungarian Grand Prix 

The season ended with Toro Rosso finishing in last place in the championship Force India was able to move ahead in the point race after finishing second in the Belgian Grand Prix At the end of the season Sbastien Buemi was able to score points in the final two races Jaime Alguersuari failed to score any points in the season

Controversy was present as whether or not the team threw away their chances by having two inexperienced drivers as essentially their car had the same DNA as what is said to have been the best on the grid Redbull Racings RB5 

Scuderia Toro Rosso confirmed that they would keep Sbastien Buemi and Jaime Alguersuari for F12010 Under the new regulations they also had to build and design there own car without help from Red Bull Technology the teams first since Minardi Alguersuari scored the first points of his career finishing ninth at the Malaysian Grand Prix They went on to perform poorly throughout the season occasionally mixing it with the saubers Force Indias and Vitaly Petrov However they were continually the driver who went out of the first qualifying with the three new teams

The 2008 contract between the FIA and the Formula One teams outlawing customer cars starting in F12010 Because of this Red Bull put the Toro Rosso team up for sale in March 2008 They had hoped to sell the team by the end of the F12009 season Until the team is sold Toro Rosso will continue in its present formOn the 3rd of January 2011 rumours spread that a buyer had been found

Sports sponsorship is a major part of Red Bulls marketing strategy Scuderia Toro Rosso is not the first sports team to be bought and completely renamed The same was done for Red Bull Racing the Austrian football club Red Bull Salzburg Austrian Ice Hockey team Red Bull Salzburg EC and MLS Red Bull New York

Other current sponsors and suppliers include Hangar 7 Volkswagen Advanti Racing USAG Magneti Marelli Advanti Racing Siemens and Hexagon Metrology

Gondwana formerly Gondwanaland is the name given to a southern supercontinent which was formed when Pangaea broke up starting 180 million years ago in the early middle Jurassic 

The Pangaean global supercontinent completed its formation 250 million years ago After the split Gondwana separated from Laurasia which was the northern part of Pangaea There were then these two large segments nearly equal in area 

While the northern hemisphere continent Laurasia moved further north Gondwana drifted south It included most of the landmasses in todays southern hemisphere including Antarctica South America Africa Madagascar AustraliaNew Guinea and New Zealand as well as Arabia and the Indian subcontinent which have now moved entirely into the Northern Hemisphere 

Gondwana itself began to break up in the mid Jurassic about 170 mya It split into the present day continents listed above

The continent of Gondwana was named by Austrian scientist Eduard Suess after the Gondwana region of central northern India from which the Gondwana sedimentary sequences are also found

The adjective Gondwanan is in common use in biogeography when referring to patterns of distribution of living organisms typically when the organisms are restricted to two or more of the now discontinuous regions that were once part of Gondwana including the Antarctic flora For example the Proteaceae a family of plants that is known only from southern South America South Africa and Australia are considered to have a Gondwanan distribution This pattern shows an ancient lineage

It was evidence of plant and animal distribution which lent weight to the ideas of Alfred Russel Wallace and Alfred Wegener Wallace explained geographical distribution as the result of evolution and Wegener used it as evidence for continental drift

Africa separated from Antarctica around 160 mya followed by the Indian subcontinent in the early Cretaceous About 65 mya Antarctica still had a tropical to subtropical climate complete with a marsupial fauna About 40 mya Australia New Guinea separated from Antarctica so that latitudinal currents could isolate Antarctica from Australia and the first ice began to appear During the Eocene Oligocene extinction event about 34 million years ago CO2 levels have been found to be about 760 ppm and had been decreasing from earlier levels in the thousands of ppm Around 23 mya the Drake Passage opened between Antarctica and South America resulting in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current that completely isolated the continent Models of the changes suggest that declining CO2 levels became more important The ice began to spread replacing the forests that then covered the continent Since about 15 mya the continent has been mostly covered with ice with the Antarctic ice cap reaching its present extension around 6 mya

There are several submarine lands in the Indian Ocean off the west of Australia They are under more than 15 kilometres of water Evidence that they are former parts of Gondwana is given by their rocks which are not typical oceanic rocks like basalt They are typical land rocks such as granite sandstone and gneiss and they have fossils of a kind now found on continental areas Recently two of these sunken islands were found to the west of Perth

Already known is Naturaliste Plateau a submerged land off Western Australia It has an area of 90000 square kilometres Interest has been shown in its potential oil deposits When above land in the Mesozoic it had a tropical climate which might have been ideal for producing coal oil and natural gas

The Kerguelen Plateau is a submerged microcontinent in the southern Indian Ocean It is about 3000 km to the southwest of Australia and extends for more than 2200 km in a northwest southeast direction It is in deep water but there is a small part of the plateau that breaks sea level forming the French Kerguelen Islands and the Australian Heard Island and McDonald Islands 

The islands are part of a large igneous province which started when Gondwana started to break up 130 million years ago in the Lower Cretaceous

Volcanic activity occurs sometimes on Heard and McDonald islands

Macrophages are white blood cells within tissues produced by the differentiation of monocytes 

Monocytes and macrophages are phagocytes acting in general immunity They also trigger specific defense mechanisms of vertebrates 

Their role is to phagocytose cellular debris and pathogens either as stationary or as mobile cells They also stimulate lymphocytes and other immune cells to respond to the pathogen

When a monocyte enters damaged tissue through the wall of a blood vessel it changes to become a macrophage Monocytes are attracted to a damaged site by chemical substances triggered by a range of stimuli At some sites such as the testis macrophages have been shown to populate the organ through proliferation 

Unlike short lived neutrophils macrophages survive longer in the body up to several months

Granulocytes are a category of white blood cells characterized by the presence of granules in their cytoplasm They are also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes because of the shape of the nucleus which has three segments The term polymorphonuclear leukocyte often refers just to neutrophils the most abundant of the granulocytes 

Granulocytes are released from the bone marrow They operate by phagocytosis and other means 

There are three types of granulocytes distinguished by their appearance under Wrights stain

Their names are derived from their staining characteristics for example the most abundant granulocyte is the neutrophil granulocyte which has neutrally staining cytoplasmic granules

Other white blood cells which are not granulocytes are mainly lymphocytes and monocytes

Monocytes are a type of white blood cell part of the human bodys immune system They are usually identified in stained smears by their large two lobed nucleus They are a kind of reserve cell which turn into macrophages and immune helper cells called dendritic cells

Monocytes work at two speeds in the immune system 

Half of all monocytes are stored as a reserve in the spleen the rest are circulating or in tissues 

Monocytes are produced by the bone marrow from stem cell precursors called monoblasts Monocytes circulate in the bloodstream for about one to three days and then typically move into tissues throughout the body They make up three to eight percent of the leukocytes in the blood 

Monocytes which migrate from the bloodstream to the tissues will then differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells which then stay in the tissue Macrophages are responsible for protecting tissues from foreign substances They are cells that possess a large smooth nucleus a large area of cytoplasm and many internal vesicles for processing foreign material

Monocytes and their macrophage and dendritic cell progeny serve three main functions in the immune system These are phagocytosis antigen presentation and cytokine production

Classical antiquity is a broad term for a long period of cultural history around the Mediterranean It includes the civilizations of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome known as the Greco Roman world 

Classical antiquity is the period in which Greek and Roman literature flourished

The earliest period of classical antiquity took place before the re appearance of historical sources after the Bronze Age collapse The earliest Greek alphabetic inscriptions are in the first half of the 8th century Homer is usually assumed to have lived in the 8th or 7th century and his lifetime is often taken as marking the beginning of classical antiquity In the same period falls the traditional date for the establishment of the Ancient Olympic Games in 776 BC

The Phoenicians originally expanded from Levantine ports by the 8th century dominating trade in the Mediterranean Carthage was founded in 814 BC and the Carthaginians by 700 BC had firmly established strongholds in Sicily Italy and Sardinia which brought about conflicts of interest with Etruria

The Archaic period followed the Greek Dark Ages and saw the rise of democracy philosophy theatre poetry as well as the revitalisation of the written language

Pottery styles of the later part of the Archaic age are the black figure pottery started in Corinth during the 7th century BC Its successor was the red figure style developed by the Andokides in about 530 BC

The classical period of Ancient Greece was from the fall of the Athenian tyranny in 510 BC to the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC During this period cane the long struggle between Sparta and Athens and the wars between the Greeks and the Persians The rise of Macedon in the 4th century overturned all other political systems at least for a while

The Hellenistic period began with Alexander when Greek became the lingua franca far beyond Greece itself and Hellenistic culture came in contact with the cultures of Persia Central Asia India and Egypt The Hellenistic period ended with the rise of the Roman Republic to a super regional power in the 2nd century BC and the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC

The Roman Forum was the central area around which ancient Rome developed

The republican period of Ancient Rome began with the overthrow of the Monarchy at about 509 BC and lasted over 450 years until its subversion through a series of civil wars and the Imperial period 

Determining the precise end of the Republic is a matter of dispute Roman citizens of the time did not recognize that the Republic had ceased to exist 

It could be said that Rome was already of imperial character since it conquered Gaul Illyria Greece and Hispania and the Roman provice Asia

During Late Antiquity Christianity rose under Constantine I and finally became the Roman imperial cult in 393 Successive invasions of Germanic tribes meant the thr end of the Western Empire in the 5th century but the Eastern Empire persisted throughout the Middle Ages as the Byzantine Empire

Respect for the ancients of Greece and Rome affected politics philosophy sculpture literature theater education architecture and even sexuality

In politics the presence of a Roman Emperor was felt to be desirable long after the empire fell This tendency reached its peak when Charlemagne was crowned Roman Emperor in the year 800 an act which led to the formation of the Holy Roman Empire The notion that an emperor is a monarch who outranks a mere king dates from this period In this political ideal there would always be a Roman Empire a state whose jurisdiction extended to the entire civilized western world

Lee Harvey Oswald was according to four government investigations the sniper who assassinated US President John F Kennedy in Dallas Texas on November 22 1963

A former US Marine who had defected to live in the Soviet Union for almost 3 years Oswald was initially arrested in the death of police officer J D Tippit who had been shot on a Dallas street shortly after Kennedy was killed Soon suspected in the death of Kennedy as well Oswald denied both killings Two days later while being transferred from police headquarters to the county jail Oswald was mortally wounded by nightclub owner Jack Ruby in full view of television cameras broadcasting live

In 1964 the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy a conclusion reached previously by the FBI and Dallas Police In 1979 The United States House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations agreed that Kennedy was killed by Oswald but also concluded it was probably as a result of a conspiracy The members of this probable conspiracy were not identified

Oswald had been born in New Orleans 2 months after his father died and his mother moved him and 2 brothers to several different towns while marrying a third husband for 3 years 1945 48 After attending 12 schools around Fort Worth New York City and New Orleans Oswald dropped out of 10th grade at age 16 and worked as a office clerkmessenger Moving back to Texas in July 1956 Oswald entered 10th grade in Fort Worth but quit school again at age 17 in October to join the US Marines as had his brother Robert after their half brother John Pic joined the US Coast Guard In 1959 Oswald received a hardship discharge to quit the Marines but defected to the Soviet Union for nearly 3 years Having married Marina the daughter of a Soviet security official he re defected back to the US with her and their daughter in June 1962

They settled in Dallas with his mother and brother Robert Oswald worked 3 months in a welding company then worked in a printing shop from October until being fired in April 1963 Oswald was later suspected of the April 10 attempt to shoot General Edwin Walker using a rifle he received through mail order in March Oswald and Marina quickly moved to New Orleans in April but she returned to Dallas in late September 1963 when he traveled to Mexico with failed plans to go to Cuba and the USSR Instead he returned to Dallas and began working at the Texas School Book Depository on October 16 1963 The FBI was investigating Marina as a possible Soviet spy That was one month before the shootings of President Kennedy and Officer Tippit

Oswald died on November 24 1963 in police custody after being shot by Jack Ruby He was survived by his wife Marina 2 year old daughter June and 1 month old daughter Rachel

A conspiracy is a secret plan among two or more people to do a particular thing often an illegal act

A race track is special place built for racing The racing may be for people animals or vehicles Examples of animal racing are horse racing Examples of vehicle racing are automobiles and motorcycles A race track may have seats for the spectators to watch the race

Other name for race tracks are race course speedway and circuit

Modern racetracks are designed with safety as the first priority This is very important for race tracks used in auto racing Safety foe the spectator track workers and racers Fences are often used to protect the spectators from the race track Barriers sometimes padded are used to stop race cars if they run off the track

Most race tracks are a closed loop The start and finish line is at the same place Some tracks are open They start at one point and end at a different location 

Some races tracks are temparary street courses Regular public roads are temporally closed and the race couse it set up using the closed roads One of the most famous street course is Circuit de Monaco Every year the Formula One Monaco Grand Prix is held on this course These types of tracks are usually called circuits

The term county jail is used in the United States for jails maintained to hold prisoners in each of the many county divisions of a US state People will be moved into a county jail from various city jails or from being handcuffed to building structures after they are arrested A county jail is often larger or more secure than many city jails Also a county jail may include many buildings or various branches perhaps miles apart from each other

Typically each county jail is maintained by a sheriffs department run by the current sheriff and his deputy officers They form a separate group from the city police or town police departments in a county

In accordance with legal rights a county jail will have some private cells to hold especially violent or controversial suspects to protect others from them or them from being targeted by the general population of the jail Also a county jail will be subject to medical or health restrictions such as providing air conditioners or Kosher foods since many detainees are still presumed innocent and are not yet proven to be criminals Some innocent people might wait 2 years in a county jail awaiting a criminal trial while unable to bond out by posting a bail bond

When people are convicted of a felony then they will be moved from the county jail to a state prison which typically only contains convicted people Hence the US state prisons typically contain mostly hardened criminals who have actually committed numerous major crimes while a county jail might contain many innocent people or first time offenders who do not have a severe criminal mindset

Because the prisons are for punishment of offenders the living conditions might be lower such as lacking air conditioning or heating or having poor food Also some convicts imprisoned for 1 or more years might be likely to steal from others so each person might be allowed to have a padlock to put food in a locker but there is no guarantee that others would not threaten or trick a person to open the locker to allow items to be taken by force or distraction In the county jail people are held for court sessions or punishment of misdemeanors so there is less chance of meeting hardened thieves However a prison puts many convicts to work to reduce the labor cost of maintaining the prison so each convict might have more ability to move around the prison complex compared to inmates in a county jail where most of them might not be working but simply waiting to be freed

For those reasons a county jail is often very different as to both structure and occupants from a prison

Maxwells Silver Hammer is a song by The Beatles from the Abbey Road album with Paul McCartney singing lead It was written by McCartney though the songwriting credit is LennonMcCartneysfnSheff2000p202

After resuming to record the Abbey Road album the Beatles began recording Maxwells Silver Hammer at Abbey Road Studios on July 9 1969 McCartney Harrison and Starr taped 16 takes of the song followed by a series of guitar overdubs

The following two days the group overdubbed vocals piano Hammond organ anvil and guitar The song was completed on August 6 when McCartney recorded a solo on a Moog synthesizersfnLewisohn1988

John Lennon later said I hate itHe did everything to make it into a single and it never was and it never could have been

George Harrison described it in 1969 as one of those instant whistle along tunes which some people hate and other people really like Its a fun song but its kind of a drag because Maxwell keeps on destroying everyone like his girlfriend then the school teacher and then finally the judge In 1977 Harrison was more candid describing it as so fruity but added we did a good job on it sfnCrawdaddy Magazine1977

The length of time it took to record the song created tension between the Beatles Paul McCartney said The only arguments were about things like me spending three days on Maxwells Silver Hammer I remember George saying Youve taken three days its only a song  Yeah but I want to get it right Ive got some thoughts on this one It was early days Moog work and it did take a bit of timesfnThe Beatles Bible2009

For the studio version of the song the anvil was played by StarrsfnMacDonald2005p357sfnBabiuk2002p256sfnLewisohn1988p179 in the Beatles film Let It Be however Mal Evans is seen hitting the anvil as the Beatles play the track

McCartney later said When we were recording Oh Darling I came into the studios early every day for a week to sing it by myself because at first my voice was too clear I wanted it to sound as though Id been performing it on stage all weeksfnThe Beatles2000p339

In a 1980 interview with Playboy magazine John Lennon said Oh Darling was a great one of Pauls that he didnt sing too well I always thought I could have done it betterit was more my style than his He wrote it so what the hell hes going to sing itsfnSheff2000p203

George Harrison described the song as a typical 1950s60s period song because of its chord structuresfnBernard1993p106

After an early attempt at this song on 27 January 1969 during the Let It Be sessions Lennon announced Just heard that Yokos divorce has just gone through after which he and the band burst into an improvised version of the song singing Im free at last instead of a part of the lyricsfnLewisohn1988p168

Octopuss Garden is a song by The Beatles written by Ringo Starr from their 1969 album Abbey Road

George Harrison worked on the song with Ringo Starr perhaps out of solidarity as his own songs being dismissed by John Lennon and Paul McCartney Harrison commented Octopuss Garden is Ringos song Its only the second song Ringo has ever written mind you and its lovely He added that the song gets very deep into your consciousness because its so peaceful I suppose Ringo is writing cosmic songs these days without even realising it

The idea for the song came about when Ringo Starr was on a boat belonging to comedian Peter Sellers in Sardinia in 1968 He ordered fish and chips for lunch but instead of fish he got squid Then the boats captain told Ringo Starr about how octopuses travel along the sea bed picking up stones and shiny objects to build gardens The Let It Be film had a scene where George Harrison is shown helping Ringo Starr work the song out on piano

The song which contains the lyrics Oh what joy for every girl and boy Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe is sometimes thought of as being a song for children like Yellow Submarine The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill or All Together Now It has also been performed by the Muppets several times in episodes of their shows

The basic instrumental track was recorded April 26 1969 with the lineup of two electric guitars bass guitar and drums George Martin did not produce the song so the Beatles themselves were listed as producer with Martins apprentice Chris Thomas present in the control room to help Thirty two takes were required before the Beatles were happy with the song

The backing vocals by McCartney and Harrison during the guitar solo were put through compressors and limiters to create a gurgling sound Harrison added the sound of bubbles being blown into a glass of milk using a straw

The song is an unusual Beatles song for many reasons its length small number of lyrics three minute descent through the same repeated guitar chords and sudden ending It is also one of the last songs that the Beatles mixed as a group on August 20 1969

Here Comes the Sun is a song by George Harrison from The Beatles 1969 album Abbey Road 

Harrison stated in The Beatles Anthology bquote Here Comes the Sun was written at the time when Apple was getting like school where we had to go and be businessmen Sign this and sign that Anyway it seems as if winter in England goes on forever by the time spring comes you really deserve it So one day I decided I was going to sag off Apple and I went over to Eric Claptons house The relief of not having to go see all those dopey accountants was wonderful and I walked around the garden with one of Erics acoustic guitars and wrote Here Comes the SunsfnThe Beatles2000p339

Harrison McCartney and Starr recorded the song in 13 takes on July 7 1969 John Lennon did not contribute to the song as he was recovering from a car crashsfnMacDonald2005p356 Towards the end of the session Harrison spent an hour re recording his acoustic guitar part Harrison capoed his guitar on the 7th fret resulting the final key of A major He also used the same technique on his 1965 song If I Needed Someone which shares a similar melodic pattern The following day he taped his lead vocals and he and McCartney recorded their backing vocals twice to give a fuller sound

A harmonium and handclaps were added on July 16 Harrisons guitar solo was overdubbed on 6 August and the orchestral parts were added on 15 August Here Comes the Sun was completed four days later with the addition of Harrisons Moog synthesizer partsfnThe Beatles Bible2008

English is the current lingua franca of international business science technology and aviation It has replaced French as the lingua franca of diplomacy since World War II The rise of English in diplomacy began in 1919 after World War I when the Treaty of Versailles was written in English as well as in French The use of English profited from the important international role of English speaking nations after World War II particularly in the establishment and organization of the United Nations English is one of the six official languages of the United Nations 

When the United Kingdom became a colonial power English was the lingua franca of the colonies of the British Empire In the post colonial period some of the newly created nations which had many indigenous languages decided to continue using English as the lingua franca to avoid the political difficulties that had developed if one had decided to use only one of the indigenous languages 

French was the language of diplomacy in Europe from the 17th century and as a result is still a working language of international institutions and is seen on documents ranging from passports to airmail letters For many years until the United Kingdom Ireland and Denmark joined in 1973 French and German were the only official working languages of the European Economic Community French was also the lingua franca of European literature in the 18th century

German served as a lingua franca in large portions of Europe for centuries mainly the Holy Roman Empire 

As it was one of the official languages of the Austro Hungarian Empire German remained an important second language in much of Central and Eastern Europe long after World War I Today it is still the most common second language in some of the countries in the region In others it is also known by significant numbers of the population

During the time of the Roman Empire the lingua francas were Greek and Latin During the Middle Ages the lingua franca was Greek in the parts of Europe Middle East and Northern Africa where the Byzantine Empire had much influence and Latin was used in the rest of Europe Latin was used as the common language of the Roman Catholic Church During the Second Vatican Council Catholic liturgy changed to local languages although Latin remains the official language of the Vatican Latin was used as the language of scholars in Europe until the early 19th century in most subjects

Sauber F1 Team is a Swiss Formula One team It was founded in the 1970s by Peter Sauber The team ran its first Formula One in F11993

Sauber was an independent team it did not have the backing of a automobile manufacuer such as Ferrari Having not won a single Grand Prix race the team was sold to BMW in 2005 The team competed as BMW Sauber from 2006 to 2009 and won one race At the end of the 2009 season BMW deceided to leave Formula One 

The race teams future was uncertain for several months BMW sold the team back to Peter Sauber which allowed the team to race in F12010 entry Due to issues with the Formula One contract the team name will remain BMW Sauber for the 2010 season

Since the 1970s Peter Sauber built sports cars After using turbocharged Mercedes V8 engines in the 1980s his team became the official factory team of Mercedes Benz reviving the Silver Arrow legend They won the 24 hours of Le Mans and the World Sportscar Championship in 1989 and 1990 competing against Jaguar and Porsche 

Mercedes Benz had planed to enter Formula One with Sauber They could not work out all the details so Mercedes withdrew their formal support Mercedes continued to fund Saubers Formula One project unofficially The Sauber team was powered by V10 Ilmor engines in a chassis named the C12 This continued the Saubers naming policy from the sports car days The C was a reference to Peter Saubers wife Christine The cars were driven by JJ Lehto and Karl Wendlinger

The Sauber racing debut took place in the first race of the F11993 season in South Africa The car finished in fifth place earning two points under the scoring system at the time Over the remainder of the season the team rarely saw the finish of a race due to unreliability and racing accidents When the team did finish a race they were often in the top ten Sauber ended the season with twelve points seventh out of the thirteen original entries

The team competed in the F11994 season as Sauber Mercedes now officially Mercedes factory team Their new car was the Sauber C13 and the Ilmor engine was re badged as the Mercedes 35 V10 Former Sauber sports car driver Heinz Harald Frentzen was Karl Wendlingers new team mate

Early performance was disappointingly delivering similar results as the previous year They only scoring a few points in the opening rounds Things got worse after the tragic deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix Wendlinger was seriously injured in a crash during practice for the Monaco Grand Prix He suffered serious head injuries and was unable to race for the of the season Wendlinger was replaced by Andrea de Cesaris After Lehto had been released by Benetton he drove for Sauber the last two races of the season

Sauber finished the season with twelve points and eighth out of the fourteen original teams entered Mercedes were unhappy with the progress of Sauber and left the team at the end of the year

For F11995 Sauber start the beginning of a ten year sponsorship deal with energy drink giant Red Bull Dietrich Mateschitz had purchased a majority share in the team Fritz Kaiser joined the team as the commercial director The Sauber C14 used a factory supply of Ford Cosworth The 1995 season saw the return of Karl Wendlinger and Heinz Harald Frentzen as the drivers Wendlingers accident in 1994 seemed to have reduced his driving potential and he was replaced rookie Jean Christophe Boullion

The team finished on a record 18 points despite the under performing Ford engine They also climbed back up to seventh in the constructors championship

In 1995 Petronas become Saubers presenting sponsor They renewed their association in 2007 by which time the team had changed ownership

Sauber used Ferrari designed engines from 1997 to 2005 They were built by Sauber Petronas Engineering a company founded for purpose of building these engines The engines were nearly identical to the ones used by Ferrari Sauber Petronas Engineering also built the gearboxes used by Sauber Sauber licensed nearly every part they could from Ferrari Sauber even had several Ferrari engineers on staff Suspicious similarities between Ferrari and Sauber chassis were pointed out but no formal accusations were ever made The FIA rules require each team to design their own chassis

In F12001 Sauber brought a virtually unknown and very inexperienced Kimi Rikknen into Formula One There were protests by a few drivers and members of the FIA including Max Mosley They believed Rikknen would pose a danger to other drivers His good performance that year proved the Sauber decision right Rikknen would later go on to win the F12007 Drivers Championship with Ferrari 

In its later years Saubers ties with Ferrari became weaker They sided with the other teams over planned rule changes Then they decided to switch to Michelin tyres while Ferrari continued to use Bridgestones Saubers final grand prix came in China Sauber departed F1 with their best results six third places and two front row starts 

Among the notable Sauber drivers were Jean Alesi F12008 Formula One championship runner up Felipe Massa Johnny Herbert and F11997 World Champion Jacques Villeneuve Two former Sauber drivers Nick Heidfeld and Jacques Villeneuve drove for the new BMW Sauber team in 2006 BMW ownership of Sauber started on January 1 2006

At the end of the 2005 season the team was bought by BMW and was renamed BMW Sauber Peter Sauber retaining a 20 stake in the team BMW sold its share of BMW Sauber back to Peter Sauber after the end of the 2009 season Because of their contract with Formula One the team still formally uses the name BMW Sauber in competitions for F12010

For the F12006 season the team signed Nick Heidfeld from Williams to be their lead driver and retained Jacques Villeneuve as the second driver Polish Robert Kubica was signed as the teams third or test driver The team continued to use Saubers facilities mostly for chassis construction and wind tunnel testing BMWs headquarters in Munich was responsible for building the new P86 V8 engine

Former Sauber title sponsor Petronas renewed their contract with the new team as a simple team sponsor as did Credit Suisse BMW Sauber announced a technical partnership with Intel and the Germany company O2 saying that it will lead to technological improvements on BMW road cars The new livery unveiled in Valencia on 17 January 2006 was the traditional BMW blue and white with a hint of red

At the Hungarian Grand Prix Heidfeld scored the teams first podium Kubica filled in for Villeneuve Villeneuve could not drive due to complications following his accident at the German Grand Prix Kubica finished seventh but was disqualified for having too light a car Kubica would drive for the rest of the season bringing an to Villeneuves F1 career

The teams finished the season fifth place in the constructors championship with 36 points

For the F12007 season Kubica and Heidfeld were again the teams drivers Sebastian Vettel would be the third or test driver Timo Glock was signed as the teams second test driver 

The performance of the BMW Saubers F108 firmly placed them as the best team behind the two championship leading teams of Ferrari and McLaren 

The Canadian Grand Prix brought the teams best finish to date with Nick Heidfeld finishing in 2nd place but Robert Kubica had a huge crash that resulted in a sprained ankle and concussion

Sebastian Vettel took his place in the United States Grand Prix and finishing in 8th place He became the youngest driver to score a Formula One World Championship point After the European Grand Prix Scuderia Toro Rosso announced that Vettel would take the second driver seat from Scott Speed

On August 21 2007 BMW confirmed its driver line up of Nick Heidfeld and Robert Kubica for the F12008 season Their 2008 car the BMW Sauber F108 was officially launched in Munich on January 14 2008 

In Bahrain Kubica scored his and the teams first ever pole position beating Felipe Massa by just under three hundredths of a second The team went on to finish 3rd and 4th in the race equaling their highest round of points scored For the first time the team was in first place in the constructors championship

BMW Saubers first race victory came in the Canadian Grand Prix BMS Sauber scored a one two finish with Robert Kubicas first race win and Nick Heidfeld taking second place This was the first Formula One victory for a BMW engine since the Williams BMW won the F12004 Brazilian Grand Prix

After the teams breakthrough win the team stopped improving the current car They started work on the new car for F12009 because of the new regulations for the next season This was reflected in the teams performance for the remainder of the 2008 season Kubica was leading the drivers championship after the Canadian Grand Prix The lack of development was showed with a drop in performance through the second half of the season BMW was outpaced by Renault Toyota and Toro Rosso

In October 2008 the team confirmed that they would stay with Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld as their drivers for the F12009 Season

Although BMW Sauber targeted the 2009 season as the year they would challenge for the title their start to the season was disappointing Kubica was in 3rd place in the opening round when he collided with Vettel while battling for 2nd place Kubica was forced to retire from the race Heidfeld secured the teams first podium of the year in Malaysia but after 6 races BMW Sauber had collected only 6 points They were in 8th place in the Constructors Championship out of 10 teams 

Several upgrades were scheduled for Turkey including an improved energy recovery braking system and a new air diffuser to improve downforce and traction While the new diffuser was installed the KERS would not fit the new car and both drivers raced without the device BMW had been one of the strongest supports of KERS After the the British Grand Prix the team announced they would stop development KERS They set their focus on improving the cars aerodynamics This left Ferrari and McLaren as the only remaining users of the KERS system In the European Grand Prix at Valencia Robert Kubica scored the teams first points since the race in Turkey

The team struggled in the early rounds of the season and did not score any points from the first three races Peter Sauber admitted at this point that his decision to rescue the team had been emotionally driven but insisted that it was a correct decision

The team ran without a primary sponsor for the first four races of the 2010 season For the Spanish and European Grand Prix they carried the logo of the Spanish arm of the Burger King fast food franchise 

In Turkey Kobayashi qualified in the top ten for the race then finished 10th collecting the teams first point in 2010

The two kingdoms arose on the most eastern coast of the Mediterranean the most western part of the Fertile Crescent between the old empires of Egypt to the south Assyria Babylonia later Persia to the north and east Greece and later Rome across the sea to the west The area is small maybe only 100 miles north to south and 40 or 50 miles east to west

Israel and Judah were from the Canaanite culture of the late bronze age and were based on villages that formed and grew in the southern Levant highlands between c1200 1000 BCE Israel became an important local power in the 9th and 8th centuries BCE before falling to the Assyrians the southern kingdom Judah enjoyed a period of richness as a dependency of the greater empires of the region before a revolt against Babylon led to it being destoried early in the 6th century Judean exiles returned from Babylon early in the following Persian period starting the period in the starting of a Judahite presence in the province of Yehud as Judah was now called Yehud was absorbed into the subsequent Greek ruled kingdoms which followed the conquests of Alexander the Great In the 2nd century BCE the Jews went up against Greek rule and created the Hasmonean kingdom which became first a Roman dependency and soon went under direct Roman rule

The central and northern part of the Levantine coast was known in Classical times as Phoenicia the southernmost portion was known to the Egyptians as Canaan by which they seem to have meant all their Asian possessions In the bible Canaan can mean all of the land west of the Jordan river or more narrowly the coastal strip By Classical times the name Canaan had been dropped in favour of Philistia Land of the Philistines despite the fact that the Philistines had long since disappeared The modern name Palestine is derived from this Northeast of CanaanPalestine was Aram later called Syria after the Assyrians who had likewise long since vanished Miller James Maxwell and Hayes John Haralson A history of ancient Israel and Judah p38 9

The Merneptah stele erected by an Egyptian pharaoh at the very beginning of Iron Age I contains the first record of the name Israel Israel is laid waste and his seed is not This Israel identified as a people were probably located in the northern part of the central highlands As the Canaanite city state system collapsed into chaos the previously unsettled highlands were starting to fill with villages surveys have identified more than 300 small settlements most of them new and the largest with a population of no more than 300 in the Palestinian highlands during Iron Age I The process was most intensive and villages larger in the northern regions although no settlements can be described as urban The total settled population at the beginning of the period was about 20000 and double this number by the end Nevertheless while Iron Age I villages with features such as four roomed houses collar rim store jars and hewn water cisterns are counted as Israelite when found in the highlands it is in fact impossible to differentiate these from Canaanite sites of the same period nor is it possible to distinguish between Hebrew and Canaanite inscriptions down to the 10th centurySmith Mark S The Early History of God p27 Throughout Iron Age I the highlands lack any sign of centralised authority or of temples shrines or centralised worship in general almost the sole marker distinguishing the highland Israelite villages from Cannanite sites is an absence of pig bones although whether this can be taken as an ethnic marker or is due to other factors remains a matter of dispute

The same period saw the rise of the kingdoms of the kingdoms of Aram Damascus and Ammon to the east of the northern hill country Moab and Edom in that order

An inscription of the Egyptian pharaoh Shoshenq I probably identical with the biblical Shishak record a series of campaigns apparently directed at the area immediately north of Jerusalem in the second half of the 10th century BCE About a hundred years later in the 9th century BCE the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III names Ahab of Israel among his enemies at the battle of Qarqar while in the Mesha stele a king of Moab celebrates his success in throwing off the oppression of the House of Omri Similarly the Tel Dan stele tells of the death of a king of Israel probably Jehoram at the hands of an Aramaen king about 841 BCE Excavations at Samaria the Israelite capital further reinforce the impression of a powerful centralised kingdom in the northern highlands during the 9th and 8th centuries In the second half of the 8th century king Hoshea of Israel revolted against the Assyrians and was crushed Part of the population was deported outside settlers were brought in to replace them and Israel became an Assyrian province

The first evidence for the existence of an organised kingdom in the southern region comes from the mid 9th century Tel Dan stele which mentions the death of a king of the House of David alongside the king of Israel the contemporary Mesha stele may also mention the House of David although the reconstruction which allows this reading is disputed It is generally assumed that this House of David is identical with the biblical dynasty but the archaeological evidence from surface surveys indicates that during the 10th and 9th centuries Jerusalem was only one of the four large villages in the area with no sign of primacy over its neighbours It was only in the last part of the 8th century that Jerusalem experienced a period of rapid growth achieving a population far greater than at any time before and clear primacy over the surrounding towns The older scholarly reconstruction of events is that this was due to an influx of refugees from Israel following its conquest by the Assyrians but the newer view is that it reflects a cooperative effort between Assyria and the kings of Jerusalem to establish Judah as a pro Assyrian vassal state exercising control over the valuable olive industry The sudden collapse of the Assyrian power in the last half of the 7th century led to an unsuccessful bid for independence under king Josiah followed by the destruction of Jerusalem by Assyrias successor the neo Babylonian empire

In 586 BCE the Babylonians under king Nebuchadnezzar II captured Jerusalem destroyed the Temple of Solomon ended the Davidic kingship and carried the people into captivity Only the poorest were left behind in Judah now the Babylonian province of Yehud with its capital at Mizpah in the former territory of Benjamin north of Jerusalem A few years later again according to the bible the governor of Yehud was murdered by rivals triggering another exodus of refugees this time to Egypt Thus by about 580 the people of Judah were to be found in three separate locations the elite in Babylon a large community in Egypt and a remnant in Judah The Exile ended when Cyrus the Great of Persia conquered Babylon The Persians reconstituted JudahYehud as a province within the satrapy Beyond the River and over the following century some of the exiles returned to Jerusalem There they eventually rebuilt the Temple but for over a century the administrative capital remained at Mizpah Samaria meanwhile continued as the province of Semarina within the same satrapy as Yehud

In 539 BCE the Persians conquered Babylon and in 537 BCE inaugurated the Persian period of Jewish history In 520 BCE Cyrus the Great allowed Jews to return to Judea and rebuild the Temple He appointed Zerubbabel governor but did not allow the restoration of the kingdom The influence of Zoroastrianism on monotheism Judaism as well as Christianity are still the subject of academic debate

Without the constraining power of the monarchy the authority of the Temple was amplified and priests became the dominant authority However the Second Temple had been constructed under the auspices of a foreign power and there were lingering questions about its legitimacy This provided the condition for various sects to develop within Judaism over the coming centuries each of which claimed to represent Judaism Most of these typically discouraged social intercourse especially marriage with members of other sects 

The end of the Babylonian Exile saw not only the construction of the Second Temple but according to the Documentary Hypothesis the final redaction of the Torah as well Although the priests controlled the monarchy and the Temple scribes and sages monopolized the study of the Torah which was read publicly on market days These sages developed and maintained an oral tradition alongside of the Holy Writ and identified with the prophets According to Geza Vermes such scribes were often addressed using a basic term of respect lord

The Hellenistic period of Jewish history began in 332 BCE when Alexander the Great conquered Persia Upon his death in 323 BCE his empire was divided among his generals At first Judea was ruled by the Egyptian Hellenic Ptolemies but in 198 BCEthe Syrian Hellenic Seleucid Empire under Antiochus III seized control over Judea 

The Hellenistic Period saw the canonization of the Tanakh according to one theory see Development of the Jewish canon for details and the emergence of extra Biblical sacred traditions The earliest evidence of a Jewish mysticism tradition surrounds the book of Ezekiel written during the Babylonian Exile Virtually all known mystical texts however were written at the end of the Second Temple period Scholars like Gershom Scholom have discerned within the esoteric traditions of the Kabbalah the influence of Persian beliefs Platonic philosophy and Gnosticism 

2 Esdras 1445 46 which was written in the second century CE declares Make public the twenty four books that you wrote first and let the worthy and the unworthy read them but keep the seventy that were written last in order to give them to the wise among your people This is the first known reference to the canonized Hebrew Bible and the seventy non canonical texts may have been mystical the Talmud suggests other mystical traditions which may have their roots in Second Temple Judaism

The Near East was cosmopolitan especially during the Hellenistic period Several languages were used and the matter of the lingua franca is still subject of some debate The Jews almost certainly spoke Aramaic among themselves Greek was at least to some extent a trade language in the region and indeed throughout the entire eastern portion of the Mediterranean Judaism was rapidly changing reacting and adapting to a larger political cultural and intellectual world and in turn drawing the interests of non Jews Historian Shaye Cohen observed

Many Jews lived in the Diaspora and the Judean provinces of Judea Samaria and the Galilee were populated by many Gentiles Jews had to live with the values of Hellenism and Hellenistic philosophy which were often directly at odds with their own values and traditions Broadly Hellenistic culture saw itself as a civilizor bringing civilized values and ways to peoples they thought of as insular or either backwards or degenerate 

For example Greek style bath houses were built in sight of the Temple in Jerusalem for instance and even in that city the gymnasium became a center of social athletic and intellectual life Many Jews including some of the more aristocratic priests embraced these institutions although Jews who did so were often looked down upon due to their circumcision which Jews saw as the mark of their covenant with God but which Hellenistic culture viewed as an aesthetic defacement of the body Consequently some Jews began to abandon the practice of circumcision while others bridled at Greek domination

At the same time that Jews were confronting the cultural differences at their door they had to confront a paradox in their own tradition their Torah laws applied only to them and to proselytes but their God they believed was the one and only God of all This situation led to new interpretations of the Torah some of which were influenced by Hellenic thought and in response to Gentile interest in Judaism It was in this period that many concepts from early Greek philosophy entered or influenced Judaism as well as debates and sects within the religion and culture of the time

In 331 BCE Alexander the Great took over the Persian Empire Upon his death in 323 BCE his empire crumbled and the province of Yehud became part of the kingdom of Egypt ruled by the Ptolemaic dynasty Ptolemaic rule was mild Alexandria became the largest Jewish city in the world and Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt promoted Jewish culture sponsoring the Septuagint translation of the Torah This period also saw the beginning of the Pharisees and other Jewish Second Temple parties such as the Sadducees and Essenes But in the early 2nd century BCE Yehud fell to the Seleucid Syrian ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes who in contrast to the tolerance shown by the Ptolemids attempted complete Hellenization of the Jews His desecration of the Temple sparked a national rebellion which ended in the expulsion of the Syrians and the re consecration of the Temple under the Maccabees

The kingdom established by the Maccabees was a conscious attempt to revive the Judah described in the bible a Jewish monarchy ruled from Jerusalem and stretching over all the territories once ruled by David and Solomon In order to carry out this project the Hasmonean kings conquered the one time Moabites Edomites and Ammonites as well as the lost kingdom of Israel

Generally the Jews accepted foreign rule when they were only required to pay tribute and otherwise allowed to govern themselves internally Nevertheless Jews were divided between those favoring hellenization and those opposing it and were divided over allegiance to the Ptolemies or Seleucids When the High Priest Simon II died in 175 BCE conflict broke out between supporters of his son Onias III and his son Jason A period of political intrigue followed with priests such as Menelaus bribing the king to win the High Priesthood and accusations of murder of competing contenders for the title The result was a brief civil war 

Huge numbers of Jews flocked to Jasons side and in 167 BCE the Seleucid king Antiochus IV invaded Judea entered the Temple and stripped it of money and ceremonial objects Jason fled to Egypt and Antiochus imposed a program of forced hellenization requiring Jews to abandon their own laws and customs under threat of slaughter At this point Mattathias and his five sons John Eleazar Simon Jonathan and Judah Maccabee priests of the Hasmon family living in the rural village of Modein assumed leadership of a bloody and ultimately successful revolt against the Seleucids

Judah liberated Jerusalem in 165 BCE and restored the Temple Fighting continued and Judah and his brother Jonathan were killed In 141 BCE an assembly of priests and others affirmed Simon as high priest and leader in effect establishing the Hasmonean dynasty When Simon was killed in 135 BCE his son John Hyrcanus took his place as high priest and king

After defeating the Seleucid forces John Hyrcanus established a new monarchy in the form of the priestly Hasmonean dynasty in 152 BCE thus making priests as political as well as religious authorities Although the Hasmoneans were popularly seen as heroes and leaders for resisting the Seleucids some regarded their reign as lacking the religious legitimacy conferred by descent from the Davidic dynasty of the First Temple Era

The rift between the priests and the sages grew during the Hellenistic period when the Jews faced new political and cultural struggles Around this time the Sadducee party emerged as the party of the priests and allied elites 

The Essenes were another early mystical religious movement who are believed to have rejected either the Seleucid appointed high priests or the Hasmonean high priests as wrong But they soon rejected the Second Temple arguing that the Essene community was itself the new Temple and that obedience to the law represented a new form of sacrifice 

Although their lack of concern for the Second Temple alienated the Essenes from the great mass of Jews their notion that the sacred could exist outside of the Temple was shared by another group the Pharisees based within the community of scribes and sages The meaning of the name is unclear though

During the Hasmonean period the Sadducees and Pharisees functioned primarily as political parties The political differences between the Sadducees and Pharisees became evident when Pharisees demanded that the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannai choose between being king and being High Priest in the traditional manner This demand led to a brief civil war that ended with a bloody repression of the Pharisees although at his deathbed the king called for a reconciliation between the two parties Alexander was succeeded by his widow whose brother was a leading Pharisee Upon her death her elder son Hyrcanus II sought Pharisee support and her younger son Aristobulus sought the support of the Sadducees

In 64 BCE the Roman general Pompey took over Jerusalem and made the Jewish kingdom a client of Rome In 57 55 BCE Aulus Gabinius proconsul of Syria split it into Galilee Samaria Judea with 5 district SanhedrinSynedrion In 40 39 BCE Herod the Great was appointed King of the Jews by the Roman Senate but in 6 CE his successor Herod Archelaus ethnarch of Judea was deposed by the emperor Augustus and his territories annexed as Iudaea Province under direct Roman administration this marked the end of Judah as an even theoretically independent kingdom

Israel and Judah inherited the religion of late first millennium Canaan and Canaanite religion in turn had its roots in the religion of second millennium Ugarit In the 2nd millennium polytheism was expressed through the concepts of the divine council and the divine family

The Book of Wisdom is one of the books of the Old Testament It has been grouped among the Septuagint or the seven wisdom books of the Bible

A priest named St Melito who lived in the second century AD said that the book was considered canonical by Jews and Christians and that Namanides was able to translate the book into Hebrew when he wrote the Pentateuch

The book was initially written in the Greek language but had the style of Hebrew poetry No one really knows who wrote the book but some archeologists think that it was most likely King Solomon who had written it This is based on some of the style and language of the book For example Thou hast chosen me to be a king of thy people and a judge of thy sons and daughters Thou hast commanded me to build a temple upon thy holy mount The style here looks a lot like another book of the Septuagint called the Ecclesiastes I Koheleth was king in Jerusalem over Israel which also leaves out Solomons name but implies through the style Some Christians at the time knew that King Solomon wasnt the author of the book as told by the Muratorian fragment that the book was written by the friends of Solomon in his honor That is why other people do not believe King Solomon was the true author A Catholic Encyclopedia also had said at the present day it is freely admitted that Solomon is not the writer of the Book of Wisdom which has been ascribed to him because its author through a literary fiction speaks as if he were the Son of David Even though the book was called the Wisdom of Solomon it was probably finished long after he died

The book has the most classical Greek language of all the books in the Septuagint It also had much of the Hebrew style that had existed when the book was written The writer also must have been deeply involved in the philosophical religious and ethical writings in Hellenistic Alexandria

The tale of Bel and the Dragon is from chapter 14 of the Book of Daniel This chapter along with chapter 13 is referred to as deuterocanonical in that it is not universally accepted among Christians as belonging to the Bible The story is typically not included in Protestant Bibles

It is believed by some scholars to have been written in the late 2nd century BC and accounted apocryphal by Protestants The chapter is formed of three independent narratives which place the culture hero Daniel at the court of Cyrus king of the Persians When King Astyages was laid to rest with his ancestors Cyrus the Persian succeeded to his kingdom There Daniel was a companion of the king and was the most honored of all his Friends

The narrative of Bel is a folk tale ridiculing worship In it the king asks Daniel Do you not think that Bel is a living god Do you not see how much he eats and drinks every day Daniel proves through a ruse that the sacred meal of Bel is actually consumed at night by the seventy priests and their wives and children who entered through a secret door when the temples doors were sealed The priests and their wives and children are killed and Daniel is permitted to destroy the idol of Bel and the temple This version has been cited as an ancestor of the locked room mystery 

In the brief companion narrative of the Dragon there was a great dragon which the Babylonians revered In this case the supposed god is no idol but not all that eats is divine Daniel slew the dragon by making cakes of pitch fat and hair The dragon ate them and burst open Now the Babylonians were indignant The king has become a Jew he has destroyed Bel and killed the dragon and slaughtered the priests they said and demanded that Daniel be handed over to them

The third narrative Daniel in the Lions Den is apparently Daniels 1st or 2nd trip It has been made into a consequence of the preceding episode but the Septuagint precedes it with the notice From the prophecy of Habakkuk son of Jesus of the tribe of Levi Daniel remained unharmed in the den with seven lions fed by the miraculous transportation of the prophet Habakkuk On the seventh day the king came to mourn for Daniel When he came to the den he looked in and there sat Daniel The king shouted with a loud voice You are great O Lord the God of Daniel and there is no other besides you Then he pulled Daniel out and threw into the den those who had attempted his destruction and they were instantly eaten before his eyes Some have suggested that the Daniel in Bel and the Dragon is different from that of Daniel 1 13

The IsraeliLebanese conflict describes a series of related military clashes involving Israel Lebanon and Syria as well as various non state militias acting from within Lebanon

The Palestine Liberation Organization recruited militants in Lebanon from among the families of Palestinian refugees who had been expelled or fled due to the creation of Israel in 1948 By 1968 the PLO and Israel were committing cross border attacks against each other After the PLO leadership and its Fatah brigade were expelled from Jordan for fomenting a revolt they entered Lebanon and the cross border violence increased Meanwhile demographic tensions over the Lebanese National Pact lead to the Lebanese Civil War Israels 1978 invasion of Lebanon pushed the PLO north of the Litani River but the PLO continued their campaign against Israel Israel invaded Lebanon again in 1982 and forcibly expelled the PLO Israel withdrew to a slim borderland buffer zone held with the aid of proxy militants in the South Lebanon Army In 1985 a Lebanese Shite resistance movement sponsored by Iran calling itself Hezbollah called for armed struggle to end the Israel occupation of Lebanese territory When the Lebanese civil war ended and other warring factions agreed to disarm Hezbollah and the SLA refused Combat with Hezbollah weakened Israeli resolve and led to a collapse of the SLA and an Israeli withdrawal in 2000 to their side of the UN designated border Citing Israeli control of the Shebaa farms territory Hezbollah continued cross border attacks intermittently over the next six years Hezbollah now sought freedom for Lebanese citizens in Israeli prisons and successfully used the tactic of capturing Israeli soldiers as leverage for a prisoner exchange in 2004 The capturing of two Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah ignited the 2006 Lebanon War Its ceasefire called for the disarmament of Hezbollah and the remaining armed camps of the PLO and for Lebanon to control its southern border militarily for the first time in four decades

The ArabIsraeli conflict is a term used to describe the political tensions and open hostilities between the Arab people of the Middle East and the Jewish community of present day Israel The conflict has been around for more than a century Some say that the conflict began when large scale Jewish immigration to Palestine started especially after the start of the Zionist movement The conflict became stronger when the modern state of Israel was created on land that the Jewish people saw as their historical homeland but the Pan Arab movement saw as belonging to the Arabs whether Muslim Christian Druze or other

The conflict started as a political and nationalist conflict when the collapse of the Ottoman Empire created tension over the division and ownership of the land Over the years it has changed from the large scale ArabIsraeli conflict to a more local Israeli Palestinian conflict though the Arab World and Israel still disagree with each other over specific territory 

The Gaza War was a three week armed conflict that took place in the Gaza Strip during the winter of 20082009 It was codenamed Operation Cast Lead by the Israeli government

The Star of Bethlehem also called the Christmas Star is a star in the Bible and Christian tradition that let the Magi know that Jesus was born and later helped them go to Bethlehem According to the Gospel of Matthew the star made the magi travel to Jerusalem There they met King Herod of Judea and asked where the king of the Jews had been born Herods advisors said that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem a nearby village because of a prophecy by Micah While the magi were going to Bethlehem they saw the star again The star stopped above the place where Jesus was born There the magi saw Jesus with his mother worshipped him and gave costly presents to him They then returned to their own country

Christians usually think of the star as a miraculous sign to show the birth of the Christ Astronomers have thought of many different explanations for the star A nova a planet a comet an occultation and a conjunction have all been suggested

Some scholars say that the story is not historically right and that the star was not real

The Star of Bethlehem is a well loved subject at planetarium shows during Christmas but the Bible seems to suggest that the magi visited Jesus at least several months after he was bornThe visit is usually celebrated on Epiphany in Western Christianity and on Christmas in Eastern Christianity

The Gospel of Matthew says that Magi came to the court of Herod in Jerusalem and told the king of a star which marked the birth of the King of the Jews

 Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold wise men from the East came to Jerusalem saying Where is He who has been born King of the Jews For we have seen His star in the East or at its rising and have come to worship Him When Herod the king heard this he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born 

Herod was troublednot about the star but because a king of the Jews had been born He understood that this meant the Messiah The Messiah was a leader of the Jewish people and had been spoken of in Old Testament prophecies So he asked his helpers where the Messiah would be born They replied that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem the place where King David was born remembering what the prophet Micah had said The king told this to the magi

 Then Herod when he had secretly called the wise men determined from them what time the star appeared And he sent them to Bethlehem and said Go and search carefully for the young Child and when you have found Him bring back word to me that I may come and worship Him also When they heard the king they departed and behold the star which they had seen in the East went before them till it came and stood over where the young Child was When they saw the star they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy 

Matthew suggests that the magi knew from the star that the king of the Jews had already been born even before they entered Jerusalem They gave Jesus gold frankincense and myrrh as presents The magi were told in a dream not to go back to Jerusalem So they left for their own country by another road When Herod found out that he had been tricked he ordered all male children in Bethlehem who were 2 or younger to be killed Joseph was warned in a dream to escape He took his family to Egypt to be safe The Gospel connects the escape to a verse from the Old Testament which is seen as a prophecy Out of Egypt I called My Son The Old Testament verse was about how the Hebrews went away from Egypt led by Moses Because of this the quote seems to suggest that Matthew thought that Jesus life was like the story of the Jewish people Judea could have symbolized Egypt and Herod represented pharaoh After Herod died God called Joseph and his family back from Egypt and they settled in to Nazareth in Galilee

One way to interpret the Star of Bethlehem is to find the year in which Jesus was born Matthew wrote that Jesus was born when Herod was king According to Josephus Herod died shortly after a lunar eclipse This lunar eclipse is often thought of as the eclipse of March 13 4 BC Those who ruled after Herod used coins showing that they dated their rules as beginning in 4 BC Because of this it is mostly thought that Herod died that year However some still disagree with this idea

From long ago many people believed that the movements of the stars were connected with the things that happened on earth Miracles were often thought to happen at the same time important people were born

The Star of Bethlehem is traditionally linked to the Star Prophecy in the Book of Numbers 

By the time the Gospels were written it was thought by many people that it was about the coming of a Messiah For example Josephus quoted it

Paintings and other works of art about the magis visit may include the star In the fresco by Giotto di Bondone it is in the shape of a comet In a tapestry about the Magi designed by Edward Burne Jones the star is held by an angel

Christmas songs often describe the Star of Bethlehem For example We Three Kings has the words O star of wonder star of light Star with royal beauty bright Westward leading still proceeding Guide us to thy perfect light

Kiddieland Amusement Park was an amusement park located just west of Chicago at the corner of North Avenue and First Avenue in Melrose Park Illinois It was home to several classic rides including the Little Dipper roller coaster which opened in 1950 The park closed on September 27 2009 at 8 PM

Kiddieland started out as a small venture of Arthur Fritz in 1929 when he purchased six ponies and offered rides as an escape for parents reeling from the Great Depression Miniature gasoline powered cars were added a few years later after Fritz learned that they were being given away to children by a Chicago newspaper as a subscription promotion

In 1940 the German Carousel two Miniature Steam Locomotives the Little Auto Ride the Roto Whip and the Ferris Wheel were added The latter two lasted until the parks closing The park saw its first major expansion in the 1950s with the addition of the Little Dipper and the Carousel of which both still exist today Bumper cars were added in the 1960s as they replaced the original pony ride

The park transferred ownership in 1977 as Arthur Fritzs grandchildren took over the park and its operation The park continued its expansion and installed several major attractions including a Log flume a swinging pirate ship a convert40ftmsingon long water coaster and numerous other attractions

A dispute developed between Shirley and Glenn Rynes who own the land that Kiddieland occupies and Ronald Rynes Jr and Cathy and Tom Norini who own the amusement park itself The landowners sued the park owners in 2004 claiming that the park had an improper insurance policy and that fireworks were prohibited in the lease The case was thrown out in a Cook County court and later in an appeals court The landowners declined to extend the lease on the land in early 2009 In late June 2010 it was announced that Kiddieland would be demolished nine months after the park was officially closed A Costco will be built in its place

The Litter Dipper was designed by Herbert Schmeck and built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company in 1950 The brakes are operated manually by a wooden handle in the station The out and back coaster is convert24ftm tall and travels a course of convert700ftm It was awarded the ACE Coaster Classic award by the American Coaster Enthusiasts Six Flags Great America bought the ride in November 2009 at a Kiddieland auction The ride cost 33000

This is a Formula One World Championship scoring system used by the Fdration Internationale de lAutomobile The FIA uses this system to decide the FIA World Drivers and Constructors Championships since the F11950 season The Championships are awarded to the driver and constructor who score the most points over the course of the season

From F11950 through F11959 a championship point was awarded to the driver and team starting in F11958 that set the fastest lap

In some seasons not all race results would be counted towards the World Championship Only a certain number of a drivers best results would count In F11988 this cause a very unusuall result Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna were the drivers for McLaren They were the best two drivers of that year There were 16 races that year but only the best 11 results counted towards the championship Prost won seven races and finished seventh races in second place He scored a total of 105 points but only 87 of them counted for the championship Senna won eight races and finished second in three giving him 90 points for the championship and 94 for the season This resulted in the strange event where Prost took a record number of points yet Senna won the champion A new system system counting all races was introduced in F11991 One additional point was also awarded to the race winner

The current system was introduced for the F12010 season It was designed to allow more teams and drivers to score points 

The most dominant Drivers Champion in terms of points scored is Jim Clark Clark scored the maximum of 54 points in both 1963 and 1965 In recent years Michael Schumacher finished on the podium in every race of the 2002 season Schumacher scored 144 of a maximum 170 points The most dominant Constructors Champion in recent times was McLaren in 1988 McLaren scored 199 of a maximum 240 points available McLaren finised 134 points ahead of the second place team In F12002 Ferrari scored 221 points of a maximum 340 points available Ferrari finished 129 points ahead of the second place team

Silverstone has suffered with bad traffic delays on race days The traffic problem was improved when the the A43 Silverstone bypass was built When the race date was moved to April in 2000 heavy rain turned the fields used for parking into mud pits causing severe problems for the spectators trying to park On F1 race day many spectators travel to the circuit by helicopter Silverstone Heliport is the busiest airport in the UK for this day

Silverstone is the current home of the British Grand Prix which it first hosted in 1948 The F11950 British Grand Prix at Silverstone was the first race in the newly created Formula One World Championship The race rotated between Silverstone Aintree and Brands Hatch from 1955 to 1986 In 1987 the rotation stopped and the race stayed at Silverstone

In 2004 Silverstone was in danger of losing the Grand Prix There was even the possibility that the British Grand Prix would not be run in 2005 In December an agreement was reached with Formula One Silverstone would host the British Grand Prix until 2009 Starting in 2010 Donington Park would become the new host of the British Grand Prix Then the Donington Park leaseholders ran into economic problems A new deal with Formula One resulted in a 17 year deal to hold the British Grand Prix at Silverstone

The Dunlop MSA British Touring Car Championship withdrew the track from its calendar in 2007 Strong demand brought the series back to Silverstone for the 2008 BTCC calendar Silverstone also hosts rounds of the FIA GT British Superbikes British F3 British GT and Le Mans Series championships as well as many club racing series It is also host to the UKs only 24 hour car race the Britcar 24 which is gaining in popularity having first started in 2005

It has in the past hosted exhibition rounds of the D1 Grand Prix both in 2005 and 2006 The course makes use of both Brooklands and Luffield corners to form an S bend a requirement in drifting The section is currently used to host a European Drift Championship round The Course also hosts the Formula Student Competition by the iMeche yearly

In 2010 Silverstone hosted its very first Superleague Formula event

Both the FIM and Silverstone agree the circuit needs to be remodeled for motorcycle racing The riders are concerned over the closeness of the bridge at Bridge corner

On 22 January 2010 it was confirmed that Silverstone would host the British round of the 2010 Superbike World Championship season The race was moved after Donington Park was deemed un raceable

Santiago de Cali was founded in 1536 and although is one of the oldest cities in America only until the 1930s accelerated its development to become a one of the major economic and industrial centers of the country and the main urban center cultural economic industrial and agriculture of southwestern of Colombia

The city has a compound name in the fashion of almost all Spanish settlements in America Santiago lives up to the Apostle Santiago Cali was founded 25 July the day which marks the date of the Apostle Santiago principal patron of Europe So given this name to the city Cali derived from the word of the Pez language Caly Like many others placements of the department Ej Buga Yumbo Sonso Dagua Petecu Tulua Chipichape Yotoco Quilichao Changos

Santiago de Cali is one of the oldest cities in Colombia and the Americas Its foundation dates back to 1536 by the conquistador Sebastian de Belalcazar to just three years after the foundation of Cartagena de Indias two years before the foundation of Santa Fe de Bogot and 26 years of the founding of the first Hispanic population on the continent Santa Mara la Antigua del Darin missing

The city is located at coordinates in the department of Valle del Cauca Geographically Cali is in the valley of the Cauca River the second largest in the country At the height of Cali this valley is 35 km wide and the urban area is on the west side of river The western part of the city is guarded by the famous Farallones de Cali which are part of the Cordillera Occidental of the Colombian Andes

The municipality of Cali bordered to the north with Yumbo and La Cumbre in the northeast by Palmira and east to Candelaria To the south is the municipality of Jamund rural areas of Buenaventura in the southwest and Dagua to the northwest

The city is flat with an average elevation of 1000 m Cali is situated besides a focal and strategic point to the west is connected with the port of Buenaventura on the Pacific coast and northeastern industrial center that conforms to Yumbo the Metropolitan Area of Cali The city is a step in addition to the Pan American Highway and therefore a must from Colombia to the Ecuador

The main river of the city and the department is the Cauca River the part of the municipality comes from the mouth of the river Jamund to the border between Cali and Yumbo The Cauca is a sinuous on his way through the department of Valle 40 miles sailed in the municipality advanced only 26 km south north after multiple meanders

The climate is tropical savanna The Western Cordillera blocks of moist air fronts from the Pacific Ocean although it is notable that the sea breeze comes to town The Western Cordillera has 2000 m average altitude in the north of the city and reached the 4000 m in the south this makes in the city the southwestern region that is more rainy than Northwest The average annual precipitation ranges from 900 mm in the drier areas to 1800 mm in wetter areas with 1000 mm average over most of the metropolitan area of Cali The average temperature is 26 C with a minimum average of 19 C and a maximum average of 34 C Dry seasons are December to March and July to August and the rainy season from April to June

The location in the Cauca Valley the climate and terrain make the city an area of great natural wealth The confluence of rivers and other water sources make the region a natural output of crops such as sugar cane and animal breeding

As for minerals although Valle del Cauca is not a metal region in the city of Cali there are several coal mines in formations called Guachinte and Ferreira located in the south and north of the urban area In the northern part of the urban area extending to Yumbo is open pit mining for construction materials

Cali have a great numbers of Universities and Knowledge Centers that make the city one of the principal centers of education in the country

A Day in the Life is a song by the English rock group The Beatles the last song on the groups 1967 album Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band It is a very famous song

Many people think that the first verse was written about the death of Tara Browne the 21 year old heir to the Guinness fortune and close friend of Lennon and McCartney who had crashed his Lotus Elan on 18 December 1966 when a Volkswagen pulled out of a side street into his path in Redcliffe Gardens Earls Court In many interviews Lennon said this was the verses main inspiration However George Martin thinks that it is a drug reference and while writing the lyrics Lennon and McCartney were imagining a stoned politician who had stopped at a set of traffic lights

The description of the accident in A Day in the Life was not a literal description of Brownes fatal accident Lennon said I didnt copy the accident Tara didnt blow his mind out but it was in my mind when I was writing that verse The details of the accident in the song not noticing traffic lights and a crowd forming at the scene were similarly part of the fiction

The final verse was inspired by an article in the Daily Mail in January 1967 regarding a substantial number of potholes in Blackburn a town in Lancashire However he had a problem with the words of the final verse not being able to think of how to connect Now they know how many holes it takes to and the Albert Hall His friend Terry Doran suggested that they would fill the Albert Hall

A Day in the Life is in the key of G major but as Alan W Pollack explains its true center of gravity is in the parallel minor and Major keys of E The verses are in G majorE minor and the bridge is in E major A 44 meter is used throughout The song is laid out with an instrumental beginning followed by three verses an orchestral crescendo a middle section an orchestral bridge the final verse a second orchestral climax and a final piano chord

Each verse sung by Lennon follows the same basic layout but each has a different way of ending The first verse which is twenty measures ends with a repetition of the F major chord progression before returning to the home key The second verse two measures shorter than the first ends on the C major chord rather than repeating the F major progression The third verse is the same as the second except that there is one more measure and the verse does not return to the home key Instead it leads to a bridge a long climax starting from low E to an E several octaves higher Random cymbal crashes are interspersed near the end to challenge your sense of meter

An alarm clock rings beginning McCartneys verse While the pulse of this section remains the same the accents suggest a tempo twice as fast as that of the verses before The three chords in this nineteen measures long section are the I flat VII and V chords This is followed by an orchestral bridge a repeated circle of fifths over twenty measures The bridge is accompanied by a wordless vocal and leads to the fourth and final verse

The final verse has the same layout as the third verse Starrs drumming however retains its double time feel from McCartneys section This verse leads to the second crescendo However after the orchestra hits its highest note there is a measure of silence which leads to the final E major piano chord

Following the final orchestral climax the song ends with one of the most famous final chords in music history Lennon McCartney Starr and Evans shared three different pianos with Martin on the Harmonium and all played an E major chord simultaneously The final chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners can hear the sounds of the studio including rustling papers and a squeaking chair

The piano chord was a replacement for a failed vocal experiment on the evening following the orchestra recording session the four Beatles had recorded an ending of their voices humming the chord but after multiple overdubs they wanted something with more impact

McCartney provided the fourth verse of the song a short piano piece he had been working on by himself with lyrics about a commuter whose uneventful morning routine leads him to drift off into a dream He had written the piece as a wistful recollection of his younger years which included riding the bus to school smoking and going to class The line Id love to turn you on which concludes both verse sections was according to Lennon also contributed by McCartney Lennon said I had the bulk of the song and the words but he contributed this little lick floating around in his head that he couldnt use for anything

The 2007 Formula One espionage controversy also known as Spygate or Stepneygate involves claim that the teams passed confidential technical information It was claimed that McLaren Formula One had information from the Ferrari team Then it was claimed that Renault F1 had information from the McLaren team

The case involved Nigel Stepney who used to work for Ferrari and was working at the time for McLaren It also included Mike Coughlan who was working for McLaren and his wife Trudy Coughlan Ferrari claimed that Stepney stole confidential technical information This became the subject of legal action in Italy and an FIA investigation The case in England was dropped after Ferrari reached an agreement with the Coughlans

The FIA penalized McLaren The biggest penalty was that McLaren excluded from the F12007 Constructors Championship They were also fined a record breaking 100 million

Then the FIA claimed Renault F1 had information about the 2006 and 2007 McLaren cars Renault were found guilty of breaking the same regulation as McLaren but Renault was not punished

Nigel Stepney was working at Ferrari with Jean Todt Ross Brawn and Rory Byrne Michael Schumacher was their superstar driver They were part of the team given the credit for changing the of fortunes of Ferrari in the late 1990s 

In February 2007 Stepney said he was unhappy with some management changes made at Ferrari On 3 July 2007 Gazzetta dello Sport reported that Ferrari had fired Stepney as a result an internal investigation 

The same day Ferrari fired Stepney they announced taking action against an engineer from McLaren later named as Mike Coughlan Coughlan was suspended by McLaren as a result Court details released say that Mike Coughlan is accused to be in possession of Ferrari documentation and that his wife is accused of photocopying them

On 8 November 2007 the FIA announced that the Renault F1 team would be need to answer a charge of possession of confidential information relating to the 2006 and 2007 McLaren Formula One cars The statement issued by the FIA states that Renault F1 was found to have information used by the 2006 and 2007 McLaren F1 cars 

On 6 July 2007 Honda Racing F1 released a statement confirming that Stepney and Coughlan approached the team regarding job opportunities in June 2007 Honda said that no confidential information had been offered or received 

Lithium oxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is Li2O It contains lithium and oxide ions 

Lithium oxide is a white solid It is a strong base It is corrosive when dissolved in water Lithium oxide dissolves in water to make lithium hydroxide It reacts with acids to make lithium salts It reacts with carbon dioxide to form lithium carbonate Lithium carbonate is much less corrosive It makes a red color in a flame

When lithium is burned to air it forms lithium oxide This reaction also makes lithium nitride It can also be made by heating lithium peroxide 

It is used as a flux in glazing ceramics It can be used in scientific research It could also be used in lithium ion batteries

Lithium oxide is very corrosive It reacts with water to make lithium hydroxide It is toxic because of its strong alkalinity

Lithium carbonate is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is Li2CO3 It contains lithium and carbonate ions

Lithium carbonate is a white solid It dissolves in water although not as much as sodium carbonate It reacts with acids to make carbon dioxide It can react with carbon dioxide temporarily to make the bicarbonate 

It can be made by mixing lithium oxide or lithium hydroxide and carbon dioxide 

Lithium carbonate is used in various medications for treating bipolar disorder It is also used in fireworks to make a bright red color It is used in processing metal oxides It can be used to make glass It is used to glaze ceramics It can also be used to dry cement It is used in making lithium ion batteries It is used in carbon dioxide detectors 

Lithium carbonate is somewhat toxic It is a base and reacts with strong acids

Lithium chloride is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is LiCl It contains lithium and chloride ions

Lithium chloride is a colorless solid It makes a bright red color in a flame It absorbs water unlike other alkali metal chlorides It also dissolves more easily in water than other alkali metal chlorides

Lithium chloride can be made by igniting lithium and chlorine but it is difficult because the reaction is violent This makes the anhydrous form Another way is mixing lithium oxide lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate with hydrochloric acid This makes the hydrate The hydrous form can be dried to the anhydrous form by heating it with hydrogen chloride gas

Lithium chloride is used to make lithium metal Lithium chloride is melted and electrolyzed This makes liquid lithium metal It is used to dry air It is also used as a flux for aluminium It can be used in making organic compounds It can be used to color flames red

Lithium chloride is somewhat toxic It was going to be used as a salt substitute but people found that it is toxic It affects the central nervous system

Oxidation state refers to the number of electrons added to or removed from an element Sodium metal for example has an oxidation state of 0 in the elemental state But when it gives up its one valence electron it becomes a sodium ion with an oxidation state of 1 Iron is another example It can lose two electrons forming an oxidation state of 2 or it can lose 3 forming an oxidation state of 3 

If elements gain electrons they have negative oxidation states If chlorine gains an electron it forms a 1 ion If sulfur gains two electrons it forms a 2 ion 

The oxidation state determines the number of atoms of other elements that can bind to the atom

All elements have an oxidation state of 0

Oxidizing agent can have two meanings In a more specific sense it can be a chemical that releases oxygen atoms For example potassium chlorate has a chemical formula of KClO3 When it oxidizes a reducing agent such as powdered aluminum metal it loses its oxygen to the aluminum and becomes potassium chloride KCl Another definition would be a chemical that accepts electrons from a reducing agent For example potassium permanganate has an oxidation state of 7 In acid solution it gains 5 electrons becoming a manganese compound with an oxidation state of 2 Most oxidizing agents of the second definition have oxygen but not all For example fluorine the most powerful oxidizing agent does not have any oxygen in it When it acts as an oxidizing agent it gains an electron to transfer from an oxidation state of 0 to an oxidation state of 1

Reducing agent refers to a chemical that gives away electrons to another chemical compound the oxidizing agent For example zinc is a reducing agent When it reacts with an oxidizing agent it gives up two electrons changing its oxidation state from 0 to 2

Reduction is any chemical reaction that involves the gain of electrons Specifically it refers to the side that accepts electrons 

When iron reacts with oxygen it forms a chemical called rust In that example the iron is oxidized and the oxygen is reduced

Reduction is the opposite of oxidation A reduction reaction always comes together with an oxidation reaction Oxidation and reduction together are called redox

Electroplating is the coating of an object with a metal It is done by immersing the object and a bar of the metal in a solution containing the metal ions Electric current is applied the positive goes to the metal and the negative goes to the object The metal bar dissolves in the solution and plates out on the object forming a thin but durable coating of metal It is often used to gold plate objects for decoration or corrosion resistance

Potassium hydroxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is KOH It contains potassium and hydroxide ions

It is a white powder It dissolves easily in water to make a basic solution It is corrosive to skin It reacts with acids to give potassium salts It is less common than sodium hydroxide About 700000 tons are made each year It is hygroscopic meaning that it absorbs water from the air and forms a solution It is very hard to get the water out again It releases heat when it is dissolved in water similar to sodium hydroxide It gradually reacts with carbon dioxide in the air to form potassium carbonate It melts easily It feels greasy when it gets on the skin because it makes soap from the fat in your skin It is made when potassium reacts with water 

It is made by electrolysis of a potassium chloride solution It can also be made by reacting calcium hydroxide with potassium carbonate The calcium carbonate precipitates and is filtered leaving potassium hydroxide

It is used to make soap It is also used in organic chemistry It can be used to make fertilizers and other potassium compounds It is used to make diesel from plants It is used in alkaline cells and nicads as an electrolyte It can be used to identify mushrooms

Cape York Peninsula is a large remote peninsula in the far north of Queensland Australia It is the largest unspoilt wilderness in eastern Australia and one of the last remaining wilderness areas on Earth The area is mostly flat and about half is used for grazing cattle Much of the wildlife is threatened by introduced species and weeds However the eucalyptus wooded savannah tropical rainforests and other types of habitat are now recognized as being globally important

The Cape York Peninsula region covers an area of about 137000 km north of 16S latitude From the tip of the peninsula Cape York it is about convert160km to New Guinea across the island and coral reefs of Torres Strait 

The west coast is bordered by the Gulf of Carpentaria and the east coast by the Coral Sea There is no clear border to the south but the boundary in the Cape York Peninsula Heritage Act 2007 of Queensland follows the 16S latitude 

At the peninsulas widest point it is 430 km from the Bloomfield River on the east coast to the Aboriginal community of Kowanyama on the west coast It is some 660 km from the southern border to the tip of Cape York The largest islands in the Torres Strait include Prince of Wales Island Horn Island Moa and Badu Island 

Cape York is the northern most point on the Australian continent It was named by Lieutenant James Cook on 21 August 1770 after Prince Edward Duke of York and Albany The Duke was a brother of King George III of the United Kingdom and died from illness in 1767 when he was only 20 years old 

The tropical landscapes are among the most stable in the world There has been no tectonic activity for millions of years The peninsula is an extremely eroded almost level low plain with mighty meandering rivers and vast floodplains There are some very low hills about 800m above sea level in the McIlwraith Range on the eastern side around Coen 

Part of Australias Great Dividing Range the Peninsula Ridge is like a backbone along the peninsula This mountain range is made up of ancient Precambrian and Palaeozoic rocks To the east and west of the Peninsula Ridge lie the Carpentaria and Laura Basins themselves made up of ancient Mesozoic sediments There are several important landforms on the peninsula the large area of undisturbed sand dunes on the east coast around Shelburne Bay and Cape Bedford Cape Flattery the huge piles of black granite boulders at Black Mountain National Park and Cape Melville and the limestone karsts around Palmerston in the south

The soils are poor even compared to other areas of Australia They are ancient and weathered not suitable for ploughing and do not respond to fertilizers Because of the poor soil the region is thinly settled Attempts to grow commercial crops have usually failed

The climate on Cape York Peninsula is tropical and monsoonal The heavy monsoon season is from November to April during which time the forest becomes almost inhabitable The dry season is from May to October The temperature is warm to hot with a cooler climate in higher areas The mean annual temperatures range from 18 C at higher elevations to 27 C on the lowlands in the drier southwest Temperatures over 40 C and below 5 C are rare

Annual rainfall is high ranging from over 2000 mm in the Iron Range and north of Weipa to about 700 mm at the southern border Most of this rain falls between November and April Only on the eastern slopes of the Iron Range is the median rainfall between June and September above 5mm Between January and March however the median monthly rainfall ranges from about 170mm in the south to over 500mm in the north and on the Iron Range

The Peninsula Ridge forms the drainage divide between the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Coral Sea To the west large winding river systems including the Mitchell Coleman Holroyd Archer Watson Wenlock Ducie and Jardine flow into the Gulf of Carpentaria During the Dry season those rivers become a series of waterholes and sandy beds Yet with the heavy rains in the Wet season they become mighty waterways spreading across huge floodplains and coastal wetlands and giving life to many freshwater and wetland species

On the Eastern slopes the shorter faster flowing Jacky Jacky Creek Olive Pascoe Lockhart Stewart Jeannie and Endeavour Rivers flow towards the Coral Sea These provide important freshwater and nutrients to the healthiest section of the Great Barrier Reef Along their banks those wild undisturbed rivers are lined with dense rainforests sand dunes or mangroves

The floodplains of the Laura Basin are now protected in the Lakefield and Jack River National Parks The plains are crossed by the Morehead Hann North Kennedy Laura Jack and Normanby Rivers

The Peninsulas rivers are famous for their hydrological integrity This means that they are still in their natural state with water flows and vegetation unchanged Cape York Peninsula is one of the few places where tropical water cycles remain unchanged Cape York Peninsula has as much as a quarter of Australias surface runoff With less than 3 of Australias land area it produces more run off than all of Australia south of the Tropic of Capricorn The peninsulas rivers are also important as they put water back into central Australias Great Artesian Basin The Queensland Government is planning to protect 13 of Cape York Peninsulas wild rivers under the Wild Rivers Act 2005

Around 40 million years ago the Indo Australian tectonic plate began to split apart from the ancient supercontinent Gondwana As it crashed into the Pacific Plate on its northward journey the high mountain ranges of central New Guinea were made around 5 million years ago Protected from this collision zone the ancient rocks of what is now Cape York Peninsula were did not move

During the Pleistocene epoch Australia and New Guinea have been land linked and separated by water a number of times During the ice ages with their low sea levels Cape York Peninsula was a low lying land bridge Another link existed between Arnhem Land and New Guinea at times making a big freshwater lake Lake Carpentaria in the centre of what is now the Gulf of Carpentaria In this way Australia and New Guinea were joined until the shallow Torres Strait was last flooded around 8000 years ago

Cape York Peninsula has a range of intact tropical rainforests tropical and subtropical grasslands savannahs and shrublands tropical savannahs heath lands wetlands wild rivers and mangrove swamps These are home to about 3300 species of flowering plants Almost all of the Cape York Peninsula still has its native vegetation Cape York Peninsula also contains one of the highest rates of endemism in Australia with more than 260 endemic plant species found so far Because of this parts of the Peninsula have been noted for their very high wilderness quality The plants of the peninsula includes original Gondwanan species plants that have developed since the breakup of Gondwana and species from Indo Malaya and from across the Torres Strait in New Guinea Most variety is in the rainforest areas Most of the Cape York Peninsula is drier than New Guinea which stops the rainforest plants of that island from moving across to Australia

Most of the Cape York Peninsula is covered in grass and woodlands These have a tall thick grass layer and scattered trees mostly eucalypts The most common tree is the Darwin stringybark Although common and complete on the peninsula tropical savannahs are now rare and in poor condition in other parts of the world

Tropical rainforests cover an area of 748000 ha or 56 percent of the total land area of Cape York Peninsula Rainforests need some rainfall during the long Dry season These conditions are mostly on the eastern slopes of the Capes coastal ranges These are old growth forests and support a huge range of plants These rainforests are of high conservation significance The largest rainforest area on the Cape is in the McIllwraith Range Iron Range area The Gondwanan plants of this area includes Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae conifers and Arthrochilus Corybas and Calochilus orchids This rainforest has at least 1000 different plants including 100 rare or threatened species and 16 of Australias orchid species

On poor dry soils there are tropical heathlands Northeast Cape York Peninsula has Australias largest areas of this highly diverse ecosystem

The big wetlands on Cape York Peninsula are among the largest richest and most diverse in Australia 19 wetlands of national significance have been identified mostly on the large floodplains and in coastal areas Important wetlands include the Jardine River National Park Lakefield National Park and the estuaries of the great rivers of the western plains Many of these wetland only happen during the Wet season and have rare or uncommon plant types 

The Peninsulas coastal areas and river estuaries are lined with mangrove forests of kwila and other trees Australias largest mangrove forest is at Newcastle Bay

The Cape has lots of animals with more than 700 vertebrate land animal species Of these 40 live only here Because of its geological history the plants and animals of Cape York Peninsula are a complex mixture of Gondwanan relics Australian isolationists and Asian or New Guinean invaders Birds include Buff breasted Buttonquail Golden shouldered Parrot Lovely Fairywren White streaked Honeyeater and Yellow spotted Honeyeater Some such as Pied Oystercatcher live in other parts of Australia but have important populations on the peninsula The Cape is also home to the Eastern brown snake one of the worlds most venomous snakes Mammals include the endangered rodent Bramble Cay Melomys which lives only on Bramble Cay in the Torres Strait

The rainforests of the Iron Range have species that also live in New Guinea including the Eclectus Parrot and Southern Common Cuscus Other rainforest animals includes 200 species of butterfly including 11 endemic butterflies one of which is the huge Green Birdwing the Green Tree Python and the Northern Quoll Number of this forest marsupial have dropped because they have tried to eat the introduced poisonous cane toads 

The riverbanks of the lowlands are home to specific wildlife of their own The rivers including the Jardine Jackson Olive Holroyd and the Wenlock are rich in fish The wetlands and coastal mangroves are noted for their importance as a fish nursery and crocodile habitat providing important drought refuge The Great Barrier Reef is off the east coast and is an important marine habitat

Cattle farms use about 57 of the total area mostly in central and eastern Cape York Peninsula Indigenous land comprises about 20 with the entire West coast being held under Native title The remainder is mostly National Park and managed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service Land uses include broad acre pastoralism bauxite and silica sand mining nature reserves tourism and fishing There are big deposits of bauxite along the west or Gulf of Carpentaria coast Weipa is the centre for mining Much has been damaged by overgrazing mining fires wild pigs cane toads weeds and other introduced species But Cape York Peninsula remains fairly unspoilt with intact and healthy river systems and no recorded plant or animal extinction since European settlement 

The Cape York Peninsula Land Use Strategy study by the Australian government in 1990 created plans to protect the wilderness A nomination for World Natural Heritage is currently being looked at by the Queensland and Australian Federal governments Major national parks include the Jardine River National Park in the far north Mungkan Kandju National Park near Aurukun and Lakefield National Park in the southeast of the bioregion

The first known contact between Europeans and Aborigines took place on the west coast of the peninsula in 1606 It was not settled by Europeans until the 19th century when fishing communities then cattle ranches and later mining towns were started European settlement led to the displacement of Aboriginal communities and the arrival of Torres Strait Islanders on the mainland Today the peninsula has a population of about 18000 of which a large percentage are Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders 

The administrative and commercial centre for much of Cape York Peninsula is Cooktown in its far southeastern corner The peninsulas largest settlement is the mining town Weipa on the Gulf of Carpentaria Most of the Peninsula has few people with half the population living in very small settlements and cattle ranches Along the Peninsula Developmental Road there are small service centres at Lakeland Laura and Coen At the tip of Cape York there is a sizeable service centre on nearby Thursday Island Aboriginal communities are at Hopevale Pormpuraaw Kowanyama Aurukun Lockhart River Napranum Mapoon Injinoo New Mapoon and Umagico Torres Strait Islander communities on the mainland are at Bamaga and Seisia A completely sealed inland road links Cairns and the Atherton Tableland to Lakeland Downs and Cooktown The road north of Lakeland Downs to the tip of the Peninsula is sometimes cut after heavy rains during the wet season

The Peninsula is a popular with tourists in the Dry Season for camping hiking birdwatching and fishing Many people make the adventurous but rewarding drive to the tip of Cape York the northernmost point of mainland Australia 

Some of the worlds most extensive and ancient Aboriginal rock painting galleries surround the town of Laura some of which are available for public viewing There is also a new Interpretive Centre from which information on the rock art and local culture is available and tours can be arranged

As weather permits the next total eclipse of the sun should be visible from Cape York Australia as well as some northern islands of New Zealand This eclipse will occur on November 13 2012

The crankshaft sometimes casually called the crank is the part of an engine which changes the up and down motion of the pistons into rotation To convert the motion the crankshaft has one or more offset shafts The pistons are connected to the crankshaft by these shafts When the piston moves up and down it pushes the offset shaft This in turn rotates the crankshaft

The pistons cause a pulsing affect in the rotation A crankshaft usually connects to a flywheel The flywheel smooths out the rotation Sometimes there is a torsion or vibration damper on the other end of the crankshaft This helps reduce vibrations of the crankshaft 

Large engines usually have several cylinders This helps to reduce pulsations from individual firing strokes For some engines it is necessary to provide counterweights The counterweight is used to offset the piston and improve balance While counterweights add a lot of weight to the crankshaft it provides a smoother running engine This allows higher RPMs to be reached and more power produced

A nickel metal hydride battery also known as NiMH is a secondary cell They are used in cameras and other electronic devices They come in a few sizes AA is the most common They do not contain toxic chemicals like the nickel cadmium battery does They work by the oxidation of hydrides such as lanthanum hydride by nickel oxide Older ones die quickly when they are not used but newer ones are made to hold a charge They have longer shelf life and are more durable than the lithium ion battery but are not as powerful for their size They used to be more expensive than nickel cadmium batteries but now the cost is similar 

Hydrogen chloride is a colorless irritating gas It can dissolve in water to make hydrochloric acid It reacts with ammonia to make a white smoke of ammonium chloride It is used in the making of plastics It can form mists in air if it absorbs water It can be made by reacting sodium chloride with sulfuric acid It can be made by reacting hydrogen and chlorine but the reaction is violent

A chemical burn is an uncomfortable sensation caused by the destruction of body tissue It is destroyed by various chemicals For example concentrated sulfuric acid makes very bad chemical burns Hydrochloric acid makes milder burns There are several ways to protect against chemical burns such as wearing gloves and a lab apron when working with chemicals Each chemical has its own way to remove it from the skin but normally drenching the burn with water should help

In music a march is a piece of music with a strong marching rhythm Marches are often written especially so that soldiers can march to them Other marches may not be intended for marching but they still have a strong regular beat so that people could if they wanted to march to the music Marches are usually 24 time or 44 although other time signatures are possible

Marches can be slow marches or quick marches A slow march may be a funeral march

John Philip Sousa was a composer whose marches became extremely popular

In classical music many composers wrote marches which are not intended to be marched to but still give the mood of a march Some famous examples of funeral marches include the second movement of Beethovens Eroica Symphony the Marche funbre in Chopins Piano Sonata in B flat minor and the Dead March in Handels oratorio Saul 

Gustav Mahler often wrote marches in his symphonies Marches often occur in operas ballets or indeed any kind of music 

Music composed for marching uses instruments that soldiers play in marching bands such as brass instruments woodwind instruments including fife snare drum and bass drum Composers writing marches in classical music may imitate the sound of military bands by using these instruments

March music is often composed for special ceremonial occasions such as coronations Edward Elgar and William Walton both wrote march music for coronations

The straight eight engine or straight 8 is an internal combustion engine with 8 cylinders Sometimes it is called an inline eight engine All eight cylinders are mounted in a straight line along one crankshaft It can be powered by different types of fuels inlcuding gasoline and diesel

A straight 8 can be designed with balanced engine forces Crankshaft vibration is present in all engines The use of a harmonic damper is needed at the end of the crankshaft Without the damper the vibrations may lead to engine failure

The straight 8 is a smooth running engine This made it popular in luxury and racing cars of the past The length of the engine required a long engine compartment This makes the basic design unacceptable in modern vehicles The design has been replaced almost completely by the shorter and sturdier V8 engine Mercedes and BMW made straight 8 aircraft engines during World War I The engine for aircraft use provided good aerodynamics 

The Duesenberg brothers introduced the first successful straight 8 racing engine in 1920 Their engine placed third fourth and sixth at the Indianapolis 500 The following year one of their cars won the French Grand Prix The straight 8 was the engine design of choice from the late 1920s until the mid 1950s Bugatti Duesenberg Alfa Romeo Mercedes Benz and Miller built successful racing cars with high performance straight 8 engines in the 1920s and 1930s

A harmonic damper is a device connected to the free end of the crankshaft of an internal combustion engine It is needed in engines with long crankshafts such as straight 8 engines It is used on most engines to reduce torsional vibrations that can occure at certain speeds

The damper consists of an inner hub attached to the end of the crankshaft An round mass is attached to the hub by an elastic material This become a spring mass damper system By selection of the damping material and the size of the mass the damper can be made to quiet the torsional vibrations The overall appearance is that of a thick disk

The Tyndale Bible generally refers to the body of biblical translations by William Tyndale Tyndales Bible is credited with being the first English translation to come directly from Hebrew and Greek texts The term Tyndales Bible is not strictly correct because Tyndale never published a complete Bible Prior to his execution Tyndale had only finished translating the entire New Testament and roughly half of the Old Testament

The chain of events that led to the creation of Tyndales New Testament started in 1522 It was in this year that Tyndale illegally acquired a copy of Martin Luthers German New Testament Tyndale was inspired by Luthers work and immediately set out to imitate Luthers work but in English He made his purpose known to the Bishop of London at the time Cuthbert Tunstall However Tunstall rejected Tyndales offer of creating an up to date modern English Bible After this rejection Tyndale moved to the continent and ended up in Hamburg where he completed his New Testament in 1524 

The first recorded complete edition of his New Testament was published in 1526 Two revised versions were latter published in 1534 and 1536 both personally revised by Tyndale himself After his death in 1536 Tyndales works have been revised and reprinted numerous times

Tyndales translations were condemned by both church and state in England where it must be said it took longer for the reform movement to take hold Tyndale was forced to flee England for the continent where he found safe haven in pro reform areas The church and state reacted strongly against Tyndales work banning his New Testament of 1526 from England In addition any copy of his work found in England was to be burned 

The legacy of Tyndales Bible cannot be overstated His translations laid the foundations for many of the English Bibles which followed his His work made up a significant portion of the Matthew Bible which was the first authorized version of the English Bible The Tyndale Bible also played a key role in spreading reformation ideas to England which had been reluctant to embrace the movement

Elephant birds are an extinct family of birds which can not fly They were found only on the island of Madagascar The group had two genera Aepyornis and Mullerornis and seven species Like several other flightless birds they were hunted to extinction 

The Elephant birds which were giant ratites have been extinct since at least the 17th century tienne de Flacourt a French governor of Madagascar in the 1640s and 1650s recorded frequent sightings of elephant birds Aepyornis one of the worlds largest birds is believed to have been over convert3mft0 tall weighing close to 400 kg Remains of Aepyornis adults and eggs have been found In some cases the eggs have a circumference of over convert1mft0 and a length up to convert34cmin The egg volume is about 160 times greater than a chicken egg

Who Feels Love is a song by the rock band Oasis It was written by the bands lead guitarist Noel Gallagher It became the second single to be released from the album Standing on the Shoulder of Giants The song reached number 4 on the UK singles charts The single was a success but it failed to achieve a Silver or better certification in the UK The previous 11 British Oasis singles had reached this level of certification

The album was noted for its psychedelic feel and Who Feels Love was the best example of this Mark Stent was praised for his production on the song creating a trippy feel like that found on Beatles songs such as Rain With the psychedelic and Eastern sound the song also reminds of George Harrison achievements like Within You Without You and also some of his solo work 

However despite the high quality production the song was not well received by the critics NME said that the production triumphs over any real sort of feeling pure mock Maharishi spirituality that not even Liam can salvage from the realm of self parody

Terror birds the family Phorusrhacidae were large carnivorous flightless birds They were the dominant predators in South America during the Cenozoic from 622 million years ago They were roughly 13 meters tall 

Titanis walleri one of the larger species is known from Texas and Florida in North America This makes the phorusrhacids the only known example of large South American predators migrating north during the Great American Interchange This took place after the volcanic Isthmus of Panama land bridge rose about three million years ago

A recently discovered species Kelenken guillermoi from Middle Miocene some 15 million years ago discovered in Patagonia in 2006 had the largest bird skull yet found The fossil has been described as being a convert71cminabbron nearly intact skull The beak is roughly convert46cminabbron long and curves in a hook shape that resembles an eagles beak Most species described as phorusrhacid were smaller convert60 90cmftabbron tall but the new fossil belongs to a bird that probably stood about convert3mftabbron tall The large terror birds were nimble and quick runners able to reach speeds of convert48kmhmphabbron

Simulations of a terror bird strike produced by the Discovery Channel using a pneumatic model have demonstrated the larger species could easily crush the skull of its prey and puncture through bone with its beak They had a fearsome weapon a beak which could be driven into prey with the force of a sledgehammer and could at speed over long distances The Phorusrhacids are colloquially known as terror birds as the larger species were apex predators during the Miocene

Phorusrhacos was a genus of giant predatory flightless birds which lived in Patagonia The terror birds lived in woodlands and grasslands Remains are known from several localities in the Santa Cruz Province of Argentina

Phorusrhacos stood around 25 meters tall and weighed approximately 130 kilograms It was nicknamed the Terror Bird for obvious reasons it was one of the largest carnivorous birds ever to have existed along with Titanis Kelenken and Brontornis Its rudimentary wings had claws shaped like a meat hook for tackling prey which was then killed with the massive beak It ate small mammals and carrion 

Its skull was up to sixty centimeters long armed with a powerful hook tipped beak The structure of the beak and the large claws on the toes show that this was a bird of prey It raced over the grassy plateaus and hills of Patagonia catching small reptiles and mammals leaving larger prey to its more massive relatives such as Brontornis

The future of the Earth will depend on many things including increases in the brightness of the Sun loss of heat energy from the Earths core and change of the planets orbit by the other things in the Solar System The Milankovitch theory says the planet will continue to go into glaciation cycles because of the planets difference in orbit from a perfect circle the axis of the planet tilting and pushing of the Earths orbit As part of the supercontinent cycle plate tectonics may create a supercontinent within 250 million350 million years Some time in the next 15 billion45 billion years the axiss tilt may begin to change into bad versions with changes in the axiss tilt of up to 90

One billion to two billion years in the future the increase in solar radiation caused by the helium build up at the core of the Sun will result in the loss of the oceans and the cessation of continental drift Four billion years from now the increase in the Earths surface temperature will cause a bad greenhouse effect By that point most if not all the life on the Earth will be gone The most likely fate of the planet is being destroyed by the Sun in about 75 billion years after the star has entered the red giant phase and expanded to cross the planets orbit

Humans now play a top role in the biosphere with the large amount of people in many of Earths ecosystems This has caused a widespread ongoing extinction of other species known as the Holocene extinction The Holocene extinction event is the result of habitat destruction the large distribution of invasive species hunting and climate change

The energy generation of the Sun is based upon changing of hydrogen into helium This occurs in the core region of the star

When the Sun first became a main sequence star it radiated only 70 of the current luminosity The luminosity has increased in a nearly linear fashion to the present increasing by 1 every 110 million years In three billion years the Sun is expected to be 33 more luminous The hydrogen fuel at the core will finally be limited in 48 billion years when the Sun will be 67 more luminous than at present Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core until the increase in luminosity reaches 121 of the present value This marks the end of the Suns main sequence lifetime and thereafter it will be into a red giant

Dromornis is a genus of fossil flightless birds It lived in Australia from the late Miocene to the early Pliocene This means early humans never met this animal 

Dromornis had a huge beak and jaw capable of great force It did not have the typical beak and claws of a carnivore and its life style is not certain Though they looked like giant emus the Dromornis are more closely related to geese 

Dromornis stirtoni was three metres tall and weighed up to half a ton It inhabited subtropical open woodland in Australia during the late Miocene It may have been partly carnivorous It was heavier than the Moa and taller than Aepyornis 

D stirtoni had a long neck and stub like wings so it was flightless Its legs were powerful but it was not a fast runner The birds beak was large and immensely powerful leading early researchers to believe that it was used to shear through tough plant stalks However others have argued that the size of the beak suggests that the bird was a carnivore There were forests and a permanent water supply where the Dromornis birds lived although the climate was unpredictable

Dromornis are part of a family of giant birds called Dromornithidae that lived from 15 million years ago until less than 30000 years ago Australasia had started to separate from other continents as Gondwana started to break up in the Mesozoic era 

Australias last connection with Antarctica broke about 40 million years ago Since then the animals of Australasia evolved slowly in almost complete isolation from the animals of other continents except for the occasional immigrant species from Asia 

Helen Beatrix Potter was an English writer illustrator mycologist and conservationist She is famous for writing childrens books with animal characters such as The Tale of Peter Rabbit

Potters family was quite rich She was educated by governesses She did not have many friends but she had many pets including Benjamin and Peter two rabbits She spent her holidays in Scotland and the Lake District There she began to learn to love nature plants and animals which she carefully painted

When she was around 30 Potter published The Tale of Peter Rabbit It was very popular She also became engaged to her publisher Norman Warne Her parents became angry and separated with her because of this They did not like her to marry someone who was socially lower than her However Warne died before he and Potter could marry

Potter began writing and illustrating childrens books full time She did not have to ask her parents for money anymore because she had money from her books In time she bought Hill Top Farm and more land In her forties she married William Heelis a local solicitor She also began raising sheep and became a farmer though she continued writing She published 23 books

Potter died on 22 December 1943 Almost all of her money was left to the National Trust Her books continue to sell well around the world in many different languages

Gastornis formerly known as Diatryma is an extinct genus of large flightless birds They lived in the late Paleocene and early Eocene epochs of the Cenozoic The first remains were discovered in the mid 19th century

In the 1870s the famous American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope discovered another more complete set of fossils in North America and named them Diatryma

The fossil remains of these birds have been found in western central Europe as well as North America Their life style is in dispute

Gastornis parisiensis measured on average 175 metres tall but large individuals grew up to 2 metres tall Gastornis had a huge beak with a slightly hooked top which suggests that it was carnivorous Gastornis had large powerful legs with large taloned feet which also were considered in support of the theory that it was a predator

Although North American and Europe were separated by the end of the Cretaceous there must have been a landbrige still in place somewhere This is because the European and North American Diatrymas were so similar Other bird and mammal genera also occur on both sides of the North Atlantic in the Palaeocene and Eocene This is evidence that Europe and North America were once connected by dry land in part of the early Cainozoic

At its time the environment where Gastornis lived had dense forest and a moist to dry subtropical or even tropical climate North America and Europe were still rather close and Greenland probably was covered with lush woodland and grassland Only narrow straits of a few 100 km at most would have blocked landbound dispersal of the Gastornis ancestors Land in North American was connected Their European range was an archipelago with the Alpsbuilding up and high sea levels in the Paleocene and Eocene Geographically it was roughly similar to todays Indonesia

Gastornis has been depicted as predatory However some doubt the bird was agile enough to catch fast moving prey and have doubts about the beak being right for carnivory It may be that Gastornis was an ambush hunter or used pack hunting techniques to pursue or ambush prey If Gastornis was a predator it would have needed some means of hunting prey through the dense forest

Alternatively they may have been mainly scavengers omnivores or even herbivores The large beak of Gastornis would have been suited for crushing seeds and tearing off vegetation But it seems too strong for a purely vegetarian diet Regardless of what these birds ate the beak may have been used also for social display its presence in all known fossils argues against a sexual display role These contradicting hypotheses which cant be separated by the evidence make the paleobiology of Gastornis unclear

Similar gigantic birds of the Cenozoic were the South American terror birds and the Australian mihirungs The former were certainly carnivorous and the latter are suspected of being predators too On the other hand ratites the flightless giant birds of our time feed on plants small vertebrates and invertebrates

Gastornis were among the largest if not the largest birds alive during the Paleogene They had few natural enemies and serious competitors If these huge birds were active hunters they must have been important apex predators which dominated the forest ecosystems of North America and Europe until the middle Eocene 

The mid Eocene saw the rise of large creodont and mesonychid predators in Eurasia and North America The appearance of these new predators coincides with the decline of Gastornis and its relatives This was possibly due to an increased tendency of mammalian predators to hunt together in packs We know of no bird which weighed more than half a metric ton Perhaps they could not evolve to larger sizes If so they could not compete by sheer bulk as mammals are often able to do

In late Paleocene deposits of Spain and early Eocene deposits of France shell fragments of huge eggs have turned up in Provence These are presumably from Gastornis 

Some of these fragments were complete enough to reconstruct a size of 24 by 10 cm with shells 2325 mm thick This is roughly half again as large as an ostrich egg and very different in shape from the more rounded ratite eggs

Lead oxide also known as plumbous oxide and litharge is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is PbO It has lead in the 2 oxidation state It also contains oxide ions 

It is a yellow or red solid When it is heated with charcoal it makes liquid lead metal It is a crystalline solid It is highly toxic since it has lead in it It reacts with acids to make other lead salts and bases to make plumbites 

It can be made by heating lead strongly in air It can be also made by heating lead carbonate or lead nitrate 

It is made when lead is taken from its ores The lead sulfide in galena is changed to lead oxide which is heated with charcoal to make liquid lead It is used to make lead glass It used to be used in lead paint

Lead oxide also known as lead tetroxide minium red lead or triplumbic tetroxide is a chemical compound It contains some lead atoms in the 2 oxidation state and some in the 4 oxidation state It is used in batteries paints and glass It dissolves in acids It is made by heating lead oxide in air It is toxic because it contains lead

Flightless birds are birds which cannot fly They rely on their ability to run or swim and have evolved from their flying ancestors There are about forty species living today the best known being the ostrich emu cassowary rhea kiwi and penguin  

Two key differences between flying and flightless birds are the smaller wing bones of flightless birds and the absent keel on their breastbone The keel anchors muscles needed for wing movement Flightless birds also have more feathers than flying birds 

New Zealand has more species of flightless birds than any other country One reason is that until the arrival of humans a thousand years ago there were no large land predators in New Zealand The main predators of flightless birds were larger birds

Some flightless varieties of island birds are closely related to flying varieties This implies that flight is a significant biological cost As soon as birds do not need to fly there is selection against flight

The smallest flightless bird is the Inaccessible Island Rail The largest living flightless bird is the Ostrich although some extinct birds grew to larger sizes

Flightless birds are easy to take care of in captivity because they do not have to be caged Ostriches were once farmed for their decorative feathers Today they are raised for meat and for their skins which are used to make leather

There were also other families of flightless birds such as the now extinct Phorusrhacidae that evolved to be very powerful terrestrial predators

The following are flightless birds during or after the Holocene period

Peter Rabbit is a fictional animal character in many childrens stories by Beatrix Potter Peter was different from the traditional hero of that time He is small emotional easily scared and a not very wise animal He first came out in The Tale of Peter Rabbit in 1902 After that he came out in five more books between 1904 and 1912 Potter made a soft doll shaped like Peter Rabbit and soon dishes and wallpaper showed pictures of him He appears as a character in the 1971 ballet film The Tales of Beatrix Potter and in the BBC series The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends He was inspired by Potters pet rabbit Peter Piper In stories he wears human clothes and walks standing up His mother is Mrs Josephine Rabbit and he has three sisters Flopsy Mopsy and Cotton tail His popularity made Potter say in 1917 All rabbits are called Peter now but she added either Peter or Brer Rabbit

Bouldering is a kind of rock climbing It is climbing without rope and harness It is climbing heights at which the climber does not usually suffer serious injuries in case of a drop To protect from injuries there are usually special bouldering mats underneath the climber It is usually practiced on large natural boulders and in climbing gyms

Boulder routes are called problems because this style is like solving climbing problems The height of boulder problems is rarely higher than 3 5 meters Otherwise the risk of injuries is too high Often other climbers who stand on the ground spot the climbers to protect them from hitting the ground with the head or the spine 

The equipment used by boulderers is not much They use special climbing shoes a bouldering mat some brushes to clean the grips and sports tape

Bouldering was invented in the late 19th century It has been first documented in France England and Switzerland It has been practiced for a long time but in the 1930s and 1940s it was practiced for its own sake in Fontainebleau in France 

Today many rock climbers are specialized boulderers and it is their favourite style of climbing

The Tale of Peter Rabbit is a childrens book written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter It is about the adventures of disobedient playful young Peter Rabbit as he is chased around the garden of Mr McGregor He escapes and goes back home to his mother The story was written for five year old Noel Moore He was the son of Annie Moore who had been Potters governess in 1893 It was corrected and privately printed by Potter in 1901 after several publishers refused to print the book It was printed by Frederick Warne Co in 1902 The book was very successful It was printed again many times It has been translated into 36 languages It sold 45 million copies and became one of the most popular books of all time

After it was printed much merchandise for both children and adults with Peter Rabbit was produced Toys dishes food clothing videos and other products showed pictures of Peter Rabbit Potter was one of the first to begin such merchandise when she made a Peter Rabbit doll in 1903 After that a Peter Rabbit board game was produced

At that time the traditional literary hero was usually a brave clever young white male Yet Peter Rabbit the hero of The Tale of Peter Rabbit was a disobedient little rabbit Through him Potter greatly changed the traditional good child of that time Peter Rabbit came out as a character in a 1971 ballet film and the tale has been used for a television series

Peter Rabbit his sisters Flopsy Mopsy and Cottontail and his mother are anthropomorphic rabbits They dress in human clothing and usually walk standing up However like real rabbits they live in a rabbit hole under a fir tree Mother Rabbit told her children not to go into the garden of Mr McGregor This is because their father was made into a pie there However while Mrs Rabbit is shopping and the girls are picking blackberries Peter enters the garden There he eats so many vegetables he becomes sick After that Mr McGregor tries to catch Peter When Peter loses his jacket and his shoes Mr McGregor uses them to dress a scarecrow Peter is almost caught by Mr McGregor many times When he finally escapes from Mr McGregor Peter goes back home to his mother She puts him to bed and makes him drink camomile tea because he is tired and sick However his sisters enjoy bread and milk and blackberries for dinner In a 1904 sequel The Tale of Benjamin Bunny Peter goes back to McGregors garden to find his lost clothes

In the 1890s Potter sent illustrated story letters to the children of Annie Moore who had used to be her governess In 1900 Moore who realized how popular Potters stories could become suggested they be made into books Potter agreed She took her letters and chose a letter written on 4 September 1893 to five year old Noel about a rabbit named Peter Potter had owned a pet rabbit called Peter Piper The letter was too short to be a proper book so Potter made the story longer and added pictures in black and white She copied the work into a hardcover book with a frontispiece picture of Mrs Rabbit giving Peter camomile tea at the end of the book

Potters manuscript book had the title of The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Mr McGregors Garden The manuscript was refused by six publishers Even Frederick Warne Co refused to print it even though it had shown interest in her artwork several years ago Some publishers wanted a shorter story Others wanted a longer one Almost all the publishers wanted the pictures to be colored Potter grew frustrated because her book continued to be refused She had already planned what her book should look like She wanted her books style and size to be like Little Black Sambo She had also already thought of how much it should cost

At last she decided to publish the book herself On 16 December 1901 the first 250 copies of her privately printed The Tale of Peter Rabbit were given out to her family and friends

In 1901 a friend of Potters family Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley changed Potters story into a poem and tried giving his version together with her illustrations and some of her corrected writing to Frederick Warne Co The company refused Rawnsleys version but they wanted to see Potters complete manuscript They hoped that The Tale of Peter Rabbit would be as successful as Helen Bannermans greatly popular Little Black Sambo and other childrens books that were being sold at that time When Warne asked why there werent any colors in the illustrations though Potter replied that rabbit brown and green colors were not interesting Warne said he would not publish the book but he said he might publish other books she wrote later 

Warne wanted color illustrations in The Tale of Peter Rabbit which he called the bunny book He also suggested that they only use 32 illustrations instead of the first 42 illustrations At first Potter did not want to color her illustrations but she came to realize that not coloring her illustrations would be a bad idea She sent Warne some new color illustrations with a copy of her privately printed edition Warne then gave these two the famous picture book artist L Leslie Brooke to see what he thought about the pictures Brooke was delighted with Potters work At the same time small picture books became very popular

Potter continued showing privately printed copies to her family and friends Soon the first private printing of 250 copies was sold out and another 200 had to be prepared She noted in one copy that her pet rabbit Peter had died on 26 January 1901 He had been nine years old

Potter and Warne agreed to publish cheap 5000 copies The next year an official contract was signed in June 1902 Potter worked hard in the process of publishing the storyshe drew her pictures again when she needed to made small changes to the writing and corrected the punctuation Even before it was published in early October 1902 the first 8000 copies were sold By the end of the year there were 28000 copies in print By the middle of 1903 there was a fifth printing and in the same month there was a sixth printing A year after the first commercial publication there were 56470 copies printed

Warnes New York office did not register the copyright for The Tale of Peter Rabbit in the United States Because of this unlicensed copies of the book began to appear in the spring of 1903 Nothing could stop the printing of unlicensed copies

This made Potter lose a great deal of money She began to fully realize the need to license her books properly when after she had successfully published The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin her father found a toy squirrel called Nutkin at the Burlington Arcade in Christmas 1903

After The Tale of Peter Rabbit began to be sold a great amount of merchandise copied its design and idea Potter registered the patent for a Peter Rabbit doll on 28 December 1903 The next year she designed a Peter Rabbit game She made firm rules about making licensed merchandise such as dolls books tea sets wallpapers pencils and pens cards and other merchandise Because the Peter Rabbit merchandise was so popular Potter later said in 1917 All rabbits are called Peter now She did add for her American readers though Peter or Brer Rabbit

Many different versions of The Tale of Peter Rabbit and merchandise about it have been produced until now There are now pop up books toy theaters and lift the flap books By 1988 there were even video versions of the story computer programs and Internet websites Puppets dolls games dishes clocks and music boxes baby and childrens clothing tea jam toothbrushes and soap stickers and even a cake about Peter Rabbit was sold in British supermarkets Large toy shops in the United States and Britian have parts of the store where they only sell Potter related toys and merchandise Some shops only sell entirely Potter related merchandise

Other merchandise about Peter Rabbit is quite different from the first Peter Rabbit In 1916 Louise A Field became rich by writing books such as Peter Rabbit Goes to School or Peter Rabbit and His Ma A movie by Golden Films The New Adventures of Peter Rabbit gave Peter longer teeth and a fourth sister named Hopsy This story had him and his city cousin Benny following a box with his sisters inside it Another video about the story showed Peter as a Christian preacher singing songs about God and Jesus with children and vegetables

The Tale of Peter Rabbit is often praised because of its simple rhythmic words

But round the end of a cucumber frame whom should he meet but Mr McGregor 

Linda Lear noted that Potter began a new kind of animal fable in The Tale of Peter Rabbit She had made one in which anthropomorphic animals look and act like real animals with pictures that were drawn by a scientifically minded artist She added that Peter Rabbits personality has a lot of real rabbity behaviour inside it She said that the tale was a perfect marriage of word and image and a triumph of fantasy and fact

Carole Scott a literary scholar and critic wrote in her essay An Unusual Hero Perspective and Point of View in The Tale of Peter Rabbit that she thought Potters story was about a naughty hero with a proper moral at the end However she remarked that Potter used many different ways to make the reader feel sympathetic for Peter Though he made his mother unhappy by disobeying her stole escaped from authority and did not get any punishment except a stomach ache Potter makes us feel sorry for him She thought the greatest conflict in the tale was between the order of society and the forces that tried to go against itbetween those who have things and those who want things and between humans and animal nature She felt that Peter was a symbol of rebellion

The Holocene extinction is the human caused mass extinction of nearly all currently living species habitat destruction and over harvesting are two of the primary causes which drive species extinct Only 15 of all life has ever been discovered yet animal species are dying by the millions yearly This is preventable if mass pollution and mass consumption of the rain forests comes to an end Sustainable lumber harvesting practices Need to become the norm in countries such as Brazil China and India

The Holocene extinction event is one of the greatest dangers mankind faces today If it is allowed to continue unhindered it will reach the Omega Point where all ecosystems on the planet will profoundly collapse leaving the planet uninhabitable to humans and barren of vital resources like soil fish and game animals for hundreds of millions of years

If this does not become a global priority within the next twenty to thirty years there is a real danger of reaching the Omega Point

Americas forests were almost entirely destroyed in around 200 years A completely virgin continent of wilderness before the settlers arrived now Americas natural herds of bison which once number in the tens of millions have been reduced to a population of around 200000 Bald Eagles have similarly suffered a 99 decline in their population since European settlers arrived

The majority of our medicines come from exotic plants and animals such as the horseshoe crab whose blue blood is used to test for impurities in new medical vaccines Every insignificant seeming bird or insect we drive extinct yearly could have potentially contained a cure for cancer conceivably even a key to greatly extending human life capacities or fundamentally improving the quality of life for people the world over

A tsunami is a chain of fast moving waves in the ocean caused by powerful earthquakes or volcanic eruptions Tsunami has a very long wave It can be hundreds of kilometers long Usually tsunami starts suddenly The waves travel at a great speed across an ocean with little energy loss They can remove sand from beaches destroy trees toss and drag vehicles damage houses and even destroy whole towns 

The water will draw back from the coast half of the wave period prior to the wave getting to the coast If the slope of the coast is not deep the water may pull back for hundreds of metres People who do not know of the danger will often remain at the shoreFile2011Sendai NOAA TravelTime Ttvulhvpd9 06jpgthumbleftEstimated tsunami travel time forecast map for the 2011 Sendai tsunami Japan 

Tsunamis can not be prevented However there are ways to help stop people from dying from a tsunami Some regions with lots of tsunamis may use warning systems which may warn the population before the big waves reach the land Because an earthquake that caused the tsunami can be felt before the wave gets to the shore people can be warned to go somewhere safe 

The deadliest tsunami recorded was on December 26 2004 It was caused by an earthquake The earthquake was said to have a magnitude of 93 on the Moment magnitude scale It was centered in the ocean near the coast of Sumatra Indonesia Over 215000 people died from this disaster The giant wave moved very quickly Hundreds of thousands of people in Indonesia Sri Lanka Thailand India Somalia and other nations were killed or injured by it

Tsunamis are often called tidal waves This is misleading because tsunamis are not related to tides

Ozai also known as Fire Lord Ozai or the Phoenix King is a fictional character and the main antagonist in Nickelodeons animated series Avatar The Last Airbender Though one shown more behind the scenes than recurringly he is nevertheless an important character in the series as he is the father of Azula and Zuko He is also the younger brother of Iroh and is the rival of the main protagonist of the series Avatar Aang who must stop Ozai to bring balance to the world He is also Fire Lord Sozins grandson He is voiced by Mark Hamill

Ozai first appears in the episode Winter Solstice Part 2 Avatar Roku in a vision where Avatar Roku explains to Aang that Ozai plans to use Sozins Comet to increase his firebending ability In the episode The Storm he is shown in a flashback of a story being told by Iroh explaining why Zuko is obsessed with capturing the Avatar Zuko is challenged to a duel by Ozai and when Zuko refuses to fight Ozai burns his sons face and banishes him Zuko now tries to capture the Avatar to restore his honor and please his father At the conclusion of the season 1 finale The Siege of the North Part 2 Ozai sees Zuko as a failure and believes Iroh is now a traitor to the Fire Nation Just before the episode ends he is seen giving a task to Azula though the details of this task are not revealed until season 2

In the episode Zuko Alone his origin is shown in a flashback from back when his father Azulon was Fire Lord After Irohs son dies from the war in Ba Sing Se Ozai claims that he should inherit the throne instead of his older brother stating that because Iroh no longer has a son the bloodline of Fire Lords would end with him Azulon infuriated at the request orders Ozai to kill his own son Zuko to understand the pain that Iroh felt Ozais wife Ursa knowing that Ozai would do anything for the throne offered Ozai a plan to spare Zukos life and his place to the throne This resulted the death of Fire Lord Azulon and the banishment of Ursa though the latter is not revealed until season 3

Ozai makes his first full appearance in the first episode of season 3 The Awakening after the Earth city of Ba Sing Se is conquered by Azula and the Fire Nation Ozai now welcomes his son Zuko home after Azula states that he killed the Avatar While in a war meeting Zuko states that even though the Earth Kingdom is conquered that they would still not officially give up Ozai concludes that the only way to defeat their resistance is to use the power of Sozins Comet to increase the Fire Nations power When it becomes known that the resistance plans to invade the Fire Nation during the eclipse Ozai evacuates the capital city and hides underground There he comes face to face with his son Zuko who finally stands up to him saying he did not kill the Avatar and hes through trying to earn his love Zuko states that what Ozai is doing is wrong that the Fire Nation should live in peace and kindness with the other nations instead of spreading fear across the world Ozai merely laughs at this Zuko then admits he will free his Uncle Iroh and help the Avatar stop him Ozai then provokes Zuko to kill him but Zuko refuses saying its the Avatars destiny to stop him not his When Zuko starts to walk away Ozai distracts him by revealing what happened to his mother When the eclipse ends Ozai bends lightning straight at Zuko but Zuko simply redirects it 

When Sozins Comet arrives he dubs himself the Phoenix King and declares that he is the ruler of the world He also appoints his daughter Azula to the rank of Fire Lord While attacking the Earth Kingdom he is confronted by Avatar Aang Because of his enhanced power and Aangs refusal to kill Ozai he originally has the advantage He is eventually defeated when Aang enters the Avatar state and strips Ozai of his Firebending ability by Energybending After the defeat Team Avatar taunts him and calls him names stating that hes not so tough now without his power He is then imprisoned in the Fire Nation prison where Zuko visits him stating that maybe prison will set him up in the right path then demands to know where his mother is

Ozai is revealed to be a cruel leader He is easily angered and merciless His cruel personality could be due to his failure in his relationship with his father Azulon who always favored his older brother Iroh over him Ozai would prove to be a heartless father to his own son Zuko believing him a failure and even burning his face and banishing him He even banished his own wife though admitted later that he felt banishment was too light a punishment He along with his daughter has a lust for power He favors his daughter over Zuko seeing her as a firebending prodigy The expectations Ozai had for Azula caused her to become stressed and paranoid eventually leading to her mental breakdown at the end of the series

Ozai is an extremely skilled and powerful firebender able to hold his own at the height of his powers due to Sozins Comet against Aang despite Aangs status as a full fledged Avatar He is one of the few who can generate lightning along with Azula and Iroh though he is shown to be the only one to shoot lightning out of both hands With his firebending ability he is able to propel himself in the air similar to a jet When Sozins Comet arrives his firebending ability increases even more After confronting the Avatar Ozais powers are taken away by Aangs Energybending

He appears as an antagonist in the video game Avatar The Last Airbender  Into the Inferno 

Fire Lord Ozai appears in the live action feature film in The Last Airbender played by Cliff Curtis Unlike the series Ozai is a regular character in the film

The Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit is a street circuit around Albert Park Lake only a couple of kilometres south of central Melbourne It is used once a year as a racetrack for the Australian Grand Prix and associated support races

The circuit uses everyday sections of road that circle Albert Park Lake a small man made lake just south of the Central Business District of Melbourne The roads that are used were rebuilt prior to the first race in 1996 to ensure consistency and smoothness As a result the Albert Park track has quite a smooth surface 

The course is considered to be quite fast and relatively easy to drive Drivers have commented that the consistent placement of corners allows them to easily learn the circuit and achieve competitive times The flat terrain around the lake coupled with a track design that features few true straights means that it is not easy to pass another car on the track Watching the entire race track can only be done from a grandstand seat

Each year most of the trackside fencing pedestrian overpasses grandstands and other motorsport infrastructure must be erected for the race This is done about one month before the Grand Prix weekend They are all removed by six weeks after the event Land around the circuit has restricted access during the grand prix weekend This includes an aquatic centre a golf course a football stadium some restaurants and rowing boathouses Many nearby local residents are unhappy with the loss of park access Some maintain a silent protest against the event The event is popular with most people in Melbourne and Australia They have a large European population and a general interest in motorsport Middle Park the home of South Melbourne FC was demolished in 1994 due to expansion at Albert Park

Albert Park has the distinction of being the only venue to hold the Australian Grand Prix in both World Championship and non World Championship formats Prior to the F11996 Grand Prix a modified version of the current circuit was used for both the 1953 and 1956 Grands Prix During this time Albert Park ran anti clockwise as opposed to the current GP circuit standard clockwise

Autdromo Jos Carlos Pace also known by its former name Interlagos is a motor racing circuit located in the city of So Paulo and named after Carlos Pace Pace was a Brazilian Formula One driver who had died in 1977 The track was renamed in his honor It is well known for being the venue of the Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix

The land on which the circuit is built was originally bought in 1926 by property developers They wanted to build a large suburban development Following financial difficulties partly due to the 1929 stock market crash it was decided to built a racing circuit instead Construction started in 1938 and the track was opened in May 1940

The traditional name of the circuit Interlagos literally means between lakes It comes from the fact that it was built between two large artificial lakes Guarapiranga and Billings They were built in the early 20th century to supply the city with water and electric power It was renamed in 1985 to its current name to honor the Brazilian Formula One driver Jos Carlos Pace who died in a plane crash in 1977

The facilities include a kart circuit named after Ayrton Senna

The circuit is one of the few non oval racing circuits to go in an anti clockwise direction The present design of the track dates back to 1990 The FIA had placed new restrictions on track length The original circuit was shortened from 7829 km to only 4397 km The track lost three long straight sections and three fast curves The direction on another curve was reversed and a new curve created The original track had many fast corners that allowed cars to keep maximum speed for up to twenty seconds This was considered very dangerous The new track still has a very long high speed section That section contains bumps high speed turns and little run off area but the track is very wide at this point

Another feature that makes Interlagos interesting is that it follows the ups and downs of hilly ground This makes the circuit harder to drive and more demanding on the cars engine The hilly course is also a good feature for cycling races held in the circuit

The circuit is known for its bumpy surface This can cause damage on an F1 car which has a very low ride height The races are also physically tough on the drivers With more right turns the drivers necks are forced to move to the left Since drivers turn left more often the other side of their neck is usually stronger

On 17 October 2007 Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos opened a new station of the Line C Autdromo near the racing circuit The Line C had been extended to improve the access between the center of So Paulo and southern area of the Greater So Paulo including the circuit This improved access to the circuit

The race start is in front of the Tribunas section and features a long straight section Next comes S do Senna a series of left right and left turns

S do Senna connects with Curva do Sol a large radius left turn that leads to Reta Oposta This refers to the unused back straight of the pre 1990 circuit Next are two left hand downhill turns that are called Descida do Lago and Mergulho Then there is a short straight section that goes downhill

After Mergulho comes a slow and difficult section with tight turns and elevation changes These turns are Ferradura Laranjinha Pinheirinho Bico de Pato and then two left hand turns called Juno

After Juno there is a long high speed section The is Subida dos Boxes a long left hand uphill turn At the end there are turns 14 and 15 that form what was once called Cotovelo

Interlagos has one of the longest pit lanes ever used in Formula One It starts just before the start finish straight and rejoining the main course after Curva do Sol Before 2007 the pits entrance was a difficult high speed left turn The pit lane entrance was changed to become safer for the 2007 Brazilian Grand Prix

Pewter is an alloy made of tin mixed with some antimony and copper It is soft and flexible It is silvery It can be melted easily It dissolves in hydrochloric acid to produce tin chloride leaving the antimony and copper behind It used to be used to make silverware because it was easily remelted It used to contain poisonous lead but it does not contain lead anymore

Tin chloride also known as stannous chloride is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is SnCl2 It has tin and chloride ions in it The tin is in its 2 oxidation state 

It is a colorless crystalline solid It is a reducing agent It is poisonous to mollusks like clams and oysters It reacts with water to make tin oxide hydrate which is white and hydrochloric acid That is why tin chloride is normally dissolved in hydrochloric acid It reacts with oxygen in the air to make tin chloride and tin oxide It reacts with silver and gold compounds to make silver and gold metal It also reacts with ferric compounds to make ferrous compounds

It reacts with bases to make tin oxide hydrate which is white if more base is added the tin oxide hydrate dissolves to make a clear solution again 

It is made when tin reacts with hydrochloric acid

It is used to electroplate tin on steel It is used in the coloring of textiles It is used to make silvered mirrors A certain plastic uses it as a catalyst It was used as a test for mercury ions If it is added to a colorless solution of mercury a white solid of mercury would form If more is added a black solid of mercury metal would be made It turns bright purple in a solution that has gold ions in it It is used in organic chemistry as a reducing agent

Tin sulfate is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is SnSO4 It contains tin and sulfate ions The tin is in its 2 oxidation state

It is a white crystalline solid It is not a reducing agent like other compounds containing tin like tin chloride It absorbs water from the atmosphere and dissolves in the water it absorbed

It is made by dissolving tin in sulfuric acid It is also made by reacting tin with copper sulfate

It is used as a source of tin ions without any tin ions contaminating them

Stannous refers to tin in its 2 oxidation state Stannous compounds are normally called tin compounds so stannous chloride would be called tin chloride Stannous compounds are reducing agents

Stannic refers to tin in its 4 oxidation state Stannic compounds are normally called tin compounds For example stannic chloride would be called tin chloride They are weak oxidizing agents They are toxic to creatures that live in water like oysters

Tin chloride also known as stannic chloride or tin dioxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is SnCl4 It contains tin and chloride ions The tin is in its 4 oxidation state

It is a corrosive liquid or solid It makes hydrochloric acid fumes which irritate the nose It reacts with strong bases to make tin oxide hydrate It also reacts with hydrochloric acid to make the SnCl62 ion

It is made by reacting tin with chlorine 

Sn 2 Cl2 SnCl4

It was used in World War I to create irritating clouds of smoke It is also used to make tin fluoride It is also used to make organic compounds that have tin in them

Tin chloride may refer to either of these compounds

Caesium 137 is an isotope of caesium It is radioactive and often is a by product of nuclear fission It has a half life of roughly 30 years

Tin oxide also known as tin dioxide or stannic oxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula SnO2 It has tin and oxide ions in it It has tin in its 4 oxidation state 

It is a white powdery solid It reacts with acids to produce stannic salts such as tin chloride with hydrochloric acid It reacts with strong bases to make stannites It reacts with carbon at a high temperature to make tin metal

It is found as cassiterite in the mineral form Cassiterite is an ore of tin 

It can be made in pure form by burning powdered tin in air

It is used to detect carbon monoxide It is also used as a catalyst for certain reactions It is also used to make ceramics opaque It is used in sensors of gases that can burn A tin oxide wire is heated When a flammable gas flows over it it can conduct a little electricity The sensor measures the electricity

Strontium 90 is a radioactive isotope of strontium It has a half life of roughly 29 years Strontium 90 and Strontium 89 have medical applications They are used for radioation therapy in the treatment of certain bone cancers Because its application generates a lot of heat it is sometimes used instead of Plutonium in nuclear power plants 

Tin oxide also known as stannous oxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is SnO It has tin in an oxidation state of 2 It also has oxide ions in it

It is normally a blue black solid It can be red but the red form is more unstable It burns in air with a green flame to make tin oxide It is a reducing agent It is rarer than tin oxide It dissolves in acids to make a colorless solution

It can be made by reacting sulfuric acid with tin and reacting the tin sulfate made with sodium hydroxide to make the tin oxide hydrate This is heated to get the tin oxide

It is used in touchscreens It is used to make a glass with gold in it called ruby glass 

Tin oxide may refer to either of the following compounds

Chemical stability refers to the resistance of a chemical to change in a chemical reaction Some chemicals like gold are very stable and resistant to change but sodium is unstable and corrodes rapidly in the presence of air When an atom has an extra electron or a missing electron it is unstable When that atom loses or gains the electron it becomes stable Stable atoms have lower energy than unstable ones

 Pisces is the twelfth astrological sign in the Zodiac It came from the Pisces constellation In western astrology this sign is no longer aligned with the constellation This is because of the precession of the equinoxes In astrology Pisces is considered a feminine negative sign 

It is also considered a water sign and one of the four mutable signs

Pisces has been traditionally ruled by the planet Jupiter but since its discovery Neptune has been considered a modern ruler of this sign Being the twelfth sign Pisces is associated with the astrological twelfth house 

Individuals born when the Sun was in this sign are considered Pisceans The Sun can be seen 1n Pisces from about February 17 to March 20 ending at the moment of vernal equinox by definition under the tropical zodiac

Under the sidereal zodiac it is generally there from about March 15 to April 13

The Circuit Gilles Villeneuve is a motor racing circuit It is the location the Formula One Canadian Grand Prix NASCAR Canadian Tire Series NASCAR Nationwide Series and Grand Am Rolex Sports Car Series

The Canadian Grand Prix was held at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve for 30 years In F12009 the race was dropped from the Formula One calendar and replaced with the new Abu Dhabi Grand Prix On 27 November 2009 Quebecs officials and Canadian Grand Prix organisers announced an aggrement with Formula One and signed a new five year contract Circuit Gilles Villeneuve will host the Canadian Grand Prix from F12010 through the F12014 seasons 

The circuit is located on le Notre Dame a man made island in the St Lawrence River It is part of the city of Montreal was originally named the le Notre Dame Circuit It was renamed in honour of Canadian Formula One driver Gilles Villeneuve following his death in 1982 Gilles is the father of Jacques Villeneuve The venue hosted the Champ Car World Series Grand Prix of Montreal from 2002 to 2006

Barriers run close to the circuit and many experienced drivers have been caught out by them A famous part of the circuit is the wall on the outside of the exit of the final chicane The wall has the slogan Bienvenue au Qubec painted on it It has been giving the nickname Mur du Qubec In F11999 the wall ended the race of three Formula One World Champions Damon Hill Michael Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve FIA GT champion Ricardo Zonta also crashed into the wall Since then the wall has been nicknamed The Wall Of Champions Other drivers who have crashed into the wall include Jenson Button Fernando Alonso and Juan Pablo Montoya

The curbs leading to the final chicane were made higher in F12005 The new curbs were more difficult for the drivers to see making the chicane even more challenging

On 23 June 2006 Canadian Press reported that the city of Montreal had awarded Normand Legault the right to stage the race weekends on the track Legault is the promoter of the Formula One race The deal run until 2011 with an option to go to 2016 Legault decided to replace the Champ Car race with races from the Grand American Road Racing Associations Rolex Series and NASCARs Nationwide Series This would be NASCARs first race in Canada On 4 August 2007 Kevin Harvick made history by winning the first Nationwide Series race at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve

A season finale is the final episode of a season of a television program This is often the final episode to be produced for a few months or longer and as such will try to attract viewers to continue watching when the series begins again

A season finale may contain a cliffhanger ending to be resolved in the next season Alternatively a season finale could bring open ended storylines to a close going out on a high and similarly maintaining interest in the series eventual return

The final episode of a television series often concludes the entire premise of the show

There are examples of episodes ostensibly having been the season finale unexpectedly becoming the de facto series finale due to the cancellation of the series Recent examples of this include John Doe Invasion Two Guys and a Girl Instant Star Las Vegas and Everybody Hates Chris

In American English the term has developed to describe the final event of a sporting season eg in soccer or Motocross perhaps partly because of the popularity of these with television viewers

In television a season premiere refers to the first episode of a new television season for a series that has been renewed

In North America a given shows season premiere often airs in September or October after several months of reruns

A season premiere usually has one or more of the following characteristics

A1 is the official title of the Great North Road in Great Britain It runs up the eastern side of England from London to Edinburgh in Scotland It is 410 miles long and is the longest numbered road in the UK The A1 has six major junctions with motorways and over 20 major junctions with other A roads 

The A1 follows for much of the way the course of a Roman road Ermine Street and the old coach route to Edinburgh It is not a motorway or freeway but much of it is now built to motorway standards It is one of two main roads going from London to the North the other being the M1 motorway

Passing through Nottinghamshire the road skirts the remains of Sherwood Forest Scotch Corner in North Yorkshire marks the point where the traffic for Glasgow and the west of Scotland divides from that for Edinburgh as it has for hundreds of years before motor traffic From North Yorkshire to Durham the road follows for part of the way another Roman road called Dere Street This road ran from Eboracum to the Antonine Wall in the lowlands of present day Scotland

Roman roads together with Roman aqueducts and the Roman army were the three of the most impressive features of the Roman Empire in Britain 

In Britannia as in other provinces the Romans constructed a network of paved trunk roads during their nearly four centuries of occupation There are about 2000 miles of Roman roads in Britain shown on the Ordnance Surveys Map of Roman Britain This contains the most accurate and up to date layout of certain and probable routes that is readily available to the general public 

The pre Roman Britons used unpaved trackways including very ancient ones running along the ridges of hills such as the South Downs Way now a public long distance footpath In contrast most of the Roman network was surveyed and built from scratch with the aim of connecting key points by the most direct possible route The roads were all paved to permit heavy freight wagons to be used in all seasons and weather

Most of the known network was complete by 180 AD Its main purpose was to allow the rapid movement of troops and military supplies It was also vital for trade and the transport of goods

Roman roads remained in use as trunk roads for centuries after the Romans withdrew from Britain in 410 AD Systematic construction of paved highways did not resume in England until the 18th century

The Romans became expert at constructing roads which they called viae It was permitted to walk or drive cattle vehicles or traffic of any description along the road The viae differed from the many other smaller or rougher roads bridle paths drifts and tracks By law the minimum width of a via was fixed at 24 m where it was straight and 49 m where it turned

The best sources of information as regards the construction of a regulation via munita are

After the civil engineer looked over the site of the proposed road and determined roughly where it should go the agrimensores went to work surveying the road bed They used two main devices the rod and a device called a groma which helped them obtain right angles The rod men put down a line of rods called the rigor A surveyor looked along the rods and told the gromatici to move them as required Using the gromae they then laid out a grid on the plan of the road

The libratores then began their work using ploughs and sometimes with the help of legionaries with spades dug down to bed rock or at least to the firmest ground they could find The excavation was called the fossa ditch The depth varied according to terrain 

In top quality roads there were five layers plus footpaths and kerbstones

The method varied according to place materials available and terrain but the plan was always the same The roadbed was layered The road was constructed by filling the ditch This was done by layering rock over other stones 

Into the fossa was dumped large amounts of rubble gravel and stone whatever fill was available Sometimes a layer of sand was put down if it could be found When it came to within 1 yd or so of the surface it was covered with gravel and tamped down a process called pavire or pavimentare The flat surface was then the pavimentum It could be used as the road or additional layers could be constructed A statumen or foundation of flat stones set in cement might support the additional layers

The final steps used concrete which the Romans had rediscovered They seem to have mixed the mortar and the stones in the fossa First a small layer of coarse concrete the rudus then a little layer of fine concrete the nucleus went onto the pavement or statumen Into or onto the nucleus went a course of polygonal or square paving stones called the summa crusta The crusta was crowned for drainage

An example is found in a early basalt road by the Temple of Saturn on the Clivus Capitolinus It had travertine paving polygonal basalt blocks concrete bedding and a rain water gutter

Cameron Giles is an American rapper better known by his stage name Camron or Killa Cam 

Camron was known for popularising the colour pink which he demonstrated in his music video for Killa Kam where he was wearing all pink clothing and drove a pink Range Rover

Camron started the No Snitchin campaign when he was shot outside a nightclub in his Lamborghini which the gunman was trying to carjack Camron said in a 60 minutes interview that he did not know the gun but he did not want to help the police because he did not want to be a snitch and it would hurt his record sales He also mentioned his Stop Snitchin campaign in another 60 minutes interview when Anderson Cooper asked him If there was a serial killer living next to you you wouldnt tell the police which he replied I would probably move

Camron has released 7 studio albums

Sepang International Circuit also features kart racing and motocross facilities

The Phoronida or horseshoe worms are a small phylum of marine animals There are twenty species in two genera

Phoronids are worm shaped but with a gut that loops and exits the body near the mouth That explains the name horseshoe worms They are found in all oceans and seas and all species have wide geographical ranges 

They occur at depths up to 400 metres but mainly between 0 to 70 metres The life span is thought to be about a year The adults are tube worms and secrete chitinous tubes in which they live These tubes can be buried in the mud or sand or rest on the surface of a rocky substrate If on rocks they may live in colonies with their tubes become twisted around each other for support Some species can dissolve away holes in rocks such as limestone calcareous seashells or even cement piers they then live in these holes which they line with their secreted tubes

They feed using a lophophore a ciliated structure that surrounds the mouth Together with the Bryozoa and Brachiopoda the phoronids belong to the lophophorates sometimes treated as a single phylum 

Though they are normally long up to 50cm Phoronids are normally very thin 

The digestive tract of Phoronids consists of a short oesophagus which leads into a spherical stomach and then into the intestines which end in the anus Phoronids have a simple blood system of one descending artery and ascending vein linked by a network of fine capillaries There are also blood vessels into each of the tentacles The blood is colourless but contains corpuscles with a haemoglobin like pigment that helps to carry oxygen

The nervous system is mainly composed by the nervous ganglion between mouth and anus a ring nerve at the basis of the lophophore one or two giant nerve fibres which issue from the ganglion and extend along the body wall There are two tubular excretory organs which discharge to the exterior via nephridiopores on the anal papilla

Phoronids may be hermaphrodites or single sexed and may also reproduce asexually Gametes are released through the nephridia Fertilisation is probably internal Phoronids follow one of two types of reproductive strategy Some species such as Phoronis ovalis lay only a few large eggs which have a lot of yolk These eggs are brooded within the adults tube they are released only when they have hatched The second strategy is to lay a much larger number of smaller eggs These eggs are released as soon as they are fertilised They hatch a few days later into what is called an actinotrocha larvae The larvae undergo a planktonic development for 23 weeks and settle after about 20 days Metamorphosis is catastrophic occurring in less than 30 minutes and leading to a slender young phoronid

Phoronids can regenerate the lophophore if it becomes damaged in fact Phoronis ovalis voluntarily loses its lophophore in order to lay its eggs Once the eggs are laid the animal grows a new lophophore

Phoronids are suspension feeders They move their lophophores into the prevailing water current Food particles in the water current are trapped in a stream of mucous that travels along the tentacles until it reaches the oral ring There it is drawn into the mouth and then on into the digestive tract Direct uptake of amino acids through the epidermis also occurs

The fossil record of phoronids is poor There are borings dating back to the Devonian which have been attributed to phoronids Iotuba chengjiangensis a form known from only three specimens in the Lower Cambrian has been interpreted as a phoronid because it appears to have had a U shaped gut and was tentaculated Phoronids may be related to the common but mysterious tubular fossils known as hederellidsrefTaylor PD and Wilson MA 2008 Morphology and affinities of hederelloid bryozoans 301309 In Hageman SJ Key MM Jr and Winston JE Bryozoan Studies 2007 Proceedings of the 14th International Bryozoology Conference Boone North Carolina July 18 2007 Virginia Museum of Natural History Special Publication 15ref

The Circuit de Catalunya is a racetrack in Montmel to the north of Barcelona Catalonia It is home to the Formula One Spanish Grand Prix and the motorcycle Catalonia Grand Prix With long straights and a variety of corners the Circuit de Catalunya is seen as an all rounder circuit It is often used for off season testing 

The Circuit de Catalunya was built in 1991 It was planned to host its first race in 1992 to go with the Olympic Games The Olympic Games were scheduled to take place in Barcelona The circuit is often referred to as Barcelona in the racing community even though it is located in Montmel The Circuit de Catalunya should not be confused with the Montjuc circuit which hosted the Spanish Grand Prix four times between 1969 and 1975 Unlike the Circuit de Catalunya Montjuc circuit is actually located within the city of Barcelona

Because of so much testing is done at this circuit Formula One drivers and mechanics are extremely familiar with it This has led to criticism that drivers and mechanics are too familiar with Catalunya reducing the amount of on track action

When the circuit opened overtaking was frequent Cars could closely follow each other through the last two corners They would slipstream down the long straight for a pass As aerodynamic balance became more important this overtaking method became less effective The cars were unable to follow each other as close They would encounter turbulence created by the leading car This made it hard for a car to get close enough to pass In F12007 the next to the last corner was replaced with a chicane This was an effort to improve passing The redesign did not increase the amount of overtaking

The Circuit de Catalunya also plays host to many other racing series including Moto GP The chicane which was put in for Formula 1 does not exist in the track layout for Moto GP and there are at least five points on the track where riders are known to pass As in Formula 1 turn one is the most popular place for overtaking

Despite its relatively small size Ross Island is the worlds 6th highest island

The island was discovered by Sir James Clark Ross in 1841 and it was later named in his honour by Robert F Scott 

Ross Island was the base for many of the early expeditions to Antarctica It was and still is the southernmost island reachable by sea Huts built by Scotts and Shackletons expeditions are still located on the island preserved as historical sites

Today Ross Island is home to New Zealands Scott Base and the largest Antarctic settlement the US Antarctic Programs McMurdo Station Greenpeace established World Park Base on the island and it ran for five years from 1987 to 1992

Excretion is one of the most basic functions of life It is the process of eliminating waste products of metabolism and other non useful materials It is an essential process in all forms of life It contrasts with secretion where the substance may have specific tasks after leaving the cell

In single celled organisms waste products are discharged directly through the surface of the cell Multicellular organisms use more complex methods Higher plants eliminate gases through the stomata on the surface of leaves Animals have special excretory organs

In mammals excretion is the formation of urine in the kidneys and expelling carbon dioxide from the lungs These waste products are eliminated by urination and breathing out respectively If excretion does not occur in an organism waste products accumulate which eventually kill the organism

Also food waste is expelled through the anus Other substances are secreted into the bile and then eliminated in the faeces The skin and lungs also have excretory functions the skin eliminates metabolic wastes like urea and lactic acid through sweatingp395 and the lungs expell carbon dioxide

Aquatic animals usually excrete ammonia directly into the water as this compound is soluble and there is ample water available for dilution In terrestrial animals ammonia like compounds are converted into other nitrogenous materials as there is less water in the environment and ammonia itself is toxic

Reptiles and birds excrete their nitrogenous wastes as uric acid in the form of a white paste This allows efficient water retention and it can be stored more easily in the egg Both uric acid and faeces are expelled through a common opening called the cloaca Their waste is usually two coloured part white and part green or black

Many bird species especially seabirds can also excrete salt via specialized nasal salt glands the saline solution leaving through nostrils in the beak

Vibration isolation is a system of devices to decouple a mechanical or structural object from its vibrating supports 

For example the handles of the saw presented in the right photo are separated from the engine and cutting bar to reduce shaking for the operator Here the spring mount is a part of this vibration isolation system

When the targeted object is rather heavy vibration isolation may be called base isolation Vibration isolation is a branch of protective techniques known as vibration control 

From the very beginning the theory of vibration isolation in general and of base isolation in particular rested on two pillars heavy damping and frequency separation Unfortunately nobody paid any attention that the heavy damping was a sort of a strong connection between a substructure and superstructure and that the idea of decoupling them with the help of such connections was of no good

In auto racing a privateer is usually an person or race team that enters a race on their own They are not directly supported by an automobile manufacturer Privateer teams often build and maintain their own vehicles 

In the early years of Formula One privately owned teams would race using a race car built by another team or constructor Many privateer entrants compete for the enjoyment of the sport and are not paid to be racing drivers

The modern F1 Concorde Agreement now requires teams to build their own cars In modern F1 terms privateer is more often used to refer to a team who are not at least part owned by large corporations such as WilliamsF1

Factory backed is a term commonly used in motor sports to describe a racing team with support from a manufacturer This support includes financial aid Motor sports is an expensive pastime and some amount of factory support is often necessary for success Full factory backing is often seen in the top levels of competition

FISA and FOCA had a number of disagreements Some teams believed that FISA was favoring the major manufacturers The teams were also unhappy about how the money in Formula One was being distributed

The FISA and FOCA disagreements became known as the FISA FOCA war This resulted in several races being canceled Goodyear threatened to quit suppling tyres to Formula One This would have been a disaster to the sport

Bernie Ecclestone of FOCA organized a meeting of team managers and FISA representatives The meeting was held at the offices of the FIA in the Place de la Concorde Paris France At the meeting they negotiated for thirteen straight hours On 19 January 1981 the first Concorde Agreement was signed The agreement was named after the plaza in Paris where the discussions took place

The contract terms remain mostly confidential It is known that teams were required to appear and compete in every race This would ensure that the newly acquired television public that they would have a race to watch The agreement also granted FOCA the right to televise Formula One races This may have been the most important part of the agreement This right was leased to Formula One Promotions and Administration a company created and owned by Bernie Ecclestone Another important part of the agreement was that the rules would be kept stable

The first Concorde Agreement expired on 31 December 1987

The second Concorde Agreement covered the f11987 through f11991 seasons

The third Concorde Agreement covered the F11992 through F11996 seasons

On 5 September 1996 the new Concorde Agreement was signed by all the teams except McLaren Williams and Tyrrell The agreement was to run from 1 January 1997 to 2002

Taking a stand against Bernie Ecclestone the FIA and the commercial aspects of Formula One put McLaren Williams and Tyrrell in a bind The three teams lost influence in the sport and income they would have received if they had signed 

A compromise was reached On 27 August 1998 the 1998 Concorde Agreement was signed This agreement expired on 31 December 2007

A meeting on the new Concorde Agreement was held on 7 December 2004 All of the teams but Ferrari attended the meeting Ecclestone offered a payment of 260000000 over three years if all the teams would renew of the Concorde Agreement

Russian painter and philosopher Nicholas Roerich initiated the modern movement for the defense of cultural objects for the idea of Peace of Civilizations Besides the recognition as one of the greatest Russian painters Roerichs most notable achievement was the Roerich Pact signed on April 15 1935 by the representatives of 21 states in the Oval Office of the White House President of the USA Franklin D Roosevelt made a decisive influence on the process of signing of this treaty by all states of American continent Incidentally Roosevelt kept in his private rooms a bust of Roerich

The Roerich Pact is not only the international treaty It is a conglomerate of legal ideas about a new state order then the state budget annually spent on culture art and education must be larger then military expenses This is the legal recognition that the protection of cultural objects is more important than any military necessity Roerich considered the care for future generations to be a cornerstone of the existence of the the constitutional state 

President of the USA Franklin D Roosevelt in the speech upon the signature of the Roerich Pact Treaty said In opening this Pact to the adherence of the Nations of the world we are endeavoring to make of universal application one of the principles vital to the preservation of modern civilization This Treaty possesses a spiritual significance far deeper than the text of the instrument itself It is important to realize that the Roerich Pact was only the first step towards the future development of a new legal culture The concrete conceptual provisions of Roerichs philosophical and legal concept of the state are based on the idea that the primary duty of the state is to preserve the national culture Ideas of Roerich Pact still do not fully implemented in the international law  and 21st century may be is a good time to implement them

The Brahmajala Sutta is the first of 34 suttas in the Digha Nikaya The name comes from brahma and jala The sutta is also called Atthajala Dhammajala Ditthijala Anuttarasangama Vijaya

The sutta discusses two main topics the elaboration of the Ten Precepts the Middle Precepts and the Great Precepts Cula sila deals with the Ten Precepts to be practised by devout buddhists while Majjhima sila gives a detailed description of the practice of the sixth seventh eighth and ninth precepts together with the practise of plant conservation and speech etiquette

The second and third parts of the sutta discuss the 62 beliefs which are devoutly practised by ascetics in India These are divided into 18 beliefs related to the past and 44 beliefs about the future

Many of these beliefs are still relevant in the modern world and thus the sutta provides Buddhist scholars with much information to ponder about the Buddhas teachings

The elaboration of these beliefs is very detailed focusing on how the beliefs come to be and the way they are described and declared The elaboration ends with the Buddhas statement about the danger of clinging to these beliefs as they are still influenced by desire hatred and ignorance that its faithful followers will not end in the final liberation but still in the cycle of samsara Believers of these faiths are compared to small fish in a pond which will be captured by a fine net no matter how much they want to escape while those who see reality as it is are beyond the net of samsara

A V12 engine often just called a V12 is an internal combustion engine with 12 cylinders The engine has six cylinders on each side called banks The two banks form a V shaped angle In most engines the two banks are at a 60 angle to each other All twelve pistons turn a common crankshaft It can be powered by different types of fuels inlcuding gasoline diesel and natural gas

Each cylinder bank is basically a straight 6 This set up has perfect balance no matter which V angle is used A V12 engine does not need balance shafts A V12 angled at 45 60 120 or 180 from each other has even firing and is smoother than a straight 6 This provides a smooth running engine for a luxury car In a racing car the engine can be made much lighter This makes the engine more responsive and smoother In a large heavy duty engine a V12 can run slower and prolonging engine life

V12 engines were first used in aircraft By the end of World War I V12s were popular in the fighters and bombers Many Zeppelins had V12 engines 

The Rolls Royce Merlin V12 powered the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire fighters that played a vital role in Britains victory in the Battle of Britain The long narrow configuration of the V12 contributed to good aerodynamics while its exceptional smoothness allowed its use with relatively light and fragile airframes 

After World War II V12 engines were mostly replaced by turbojet and turboprop engines These engines produced more power for their weight and fewer problems in large aircraft

In cars V12 engines are not common because of their complexity and cost They are normally found only in high end sports cars and luxury cars For these cars they are desired for their power low vibration and distinctive sound

Before World War II V12 engines were found in many luxury cars In the 1930s V8 engines started to replace the V12s The V8 engine design was improved to make it lighter and produce more power than the V12 Since World War II only a few car manufactures have used V12 engines 

In 1997 Toyota equipped their Century Limousine with a 50 L V12 making it the first Japanese production passenger car with a V12 In 2009 China FAW Group Corporation equipped their Hongqi HQE with a 60 L V12 making it the first Chinese production passenger car so equipped

In the past V12 engines were common in Formula One and endurance racing Ferrari used V12 engines in 1950 the first year of Formula One Several factors made teams stop using the V12 engine Improvements to the V8 engine in particular Ford Cosworth engine Small lightweight turbocharged engines were developed that produced more power for the weight And finally rule changes that limited the size of engines and the power they could produce

In the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans the first place car was a Audi R10 TDI with a V12 diesel engine The second place car was a Peugeot 908 also with a V12 diesel

V12 is a common configuration for large diesel engines Heavy trucks often use large V12 engines Many diesel locomotives have V12 engines Mercedes builds V12 diesel engines for marine use 

V12 is a common configuration for tanks and other armored fighting vehicles

Im Outta Time is a single by the rock band Oasis The song is featured on their seventh studio album Dig Out Your Soul The second single from the album Im Outta Time was written by lead vocalist Liam Gallagher and released on 1 December 2008

The song has similarity in style to John Lennons work in the early 1970s The piano which features on the track partly sounds like Lennons Jealous Guy The song also has a backing piano similar to The Beatles A Day in the Life Liam jokingly claims that it took him nine years to write the song

The song features a short speech from John Lennon taken from one of his last interviews in 1980 The speech sample says As Churchill said its every Englishmans inalienable right to live where the hell he likes Whats it going to do vanish Is it not going to be there when I get back

The song has been noted as one of the highlights of the album with guitarist Noel Gallagher labeling it deceptively brilliant It has also been praised by music critics with NME calling it a return to form and comparing it to the music of Oasis admired rock band The Beatles

The Hemichordata is a phylum of worm shaped marine deuterostome animals generally considered the sister group of the echinoderms They date back to the Lower or Middle Cambrian and include an important class of fossils called graptolites most of which became extinct in the Carboniferous 

The bodies of Hemichordates are divided into three parts proboscis collar and trunk They have open circulatory systems and a complete digestive tract but the musculature in their gut is very poorly developed and food is mostly transported through it by using the cilia that cover its inside surface

A hollow neural tube exists among some species probably a primitive trait they share with the common ancestor of chordata and the rest of the deuterostomes

The hemichordates give us the closest living phylogenetic relatives between the chordates and other invertebrates Thus these marine worms are of great interest to those studying the origins of chordate development 

Hemichordates are known to develop in two ways either directly or indirectly Hemichordates are a phylum composed of two living classes the enteropneusts and the pterobranchs The enteropneusts have two developmental strategies direct and indirect development The indirect development is ends in an long pelagic larval stage This means that these species have a larval stage which feeds on plankton before turning into an adult worm Those species that develop directly bypass this prolonged larval stage and develop directly into an adult worm

 Graptolites 

Graptolites are commonm fossils from the Palaeozoic They are colonial animals known chiefly from the Upper Cambrian to the Lower Carboniferous A possible early graptolite Chaunograptus is known from the Middle Cambrian 

The name graptolite comes from the Greek graptos meaning written and lithos meaning rock Many graptolite fossils resemble hieroglyphs written on the rock Linnaeus originally regarded them as pictures resembling fossils rather than true fossils More recent work places them near the pterobranchs possibly within

Each graptolite colony is known as a rhabdosome and has a variable number of branches coming from an initial individual Each subsequent zooid is housed within a tubular or cup like structure In some colonies there are two sizes of theca and it has been suggested that this difference is due to sexual dimorphism The number of branches and the arrangement of the thecae are important features in the identification of graptolite fossils Their general shape has been compared with that of a hacksaw blade

Most of the tree like forms are classified as dendroid graptolites They appear earlier in the fossil record and were benthic animals attached to the sea floor by a root like base Graptolites with relatively few branches were derived from the dendroid graptolites at the beginning of the Ordovician period This latter type were pelagic drifting freely on the surface of ancient seas or attached to floating seaweed by means of a slender thread They were a successful and prolific group being the most important animal members of the plankton until they died out in the early part of the Devonian period The dendroid graptolites survived until the Carboniferous period

The Acorn worms or Enteropneusta are a Hemichordate class of invertebrates closely related to the chordates There are about 70 species of acorn worm in the world the main species for research being Saccoglossus kowaleski

All species are benthic and either deposit feeders or suspension feeders Some of these worms may grow to be very long one particular species may reach a length of 25 meters although most acorn worms are much smaller One genus Balanoglossus is also known as the tongue worm

Pterobranchia is a clade of small worm shaped animals They belong to the Hemichordata and live in secreted tubes on the ocean floor Pterobranchia feed by filtering plankton out of the water with the help of cilia attached to tentacles There are about 30 known living species in the group

The class Pterobranchia was established by E Ray Lankester in 1877 It contained at that time the single genus Rhabdopleura The publication of the Challenger Report in 1887 showed that Cephalodiscus the second genus now included in the order had affinities in the direction of the Enteropneusta

Studies under an electron microscope have suggested that pterobranchs belong to the same clade as the extinct graptolites

Deus ex machina is the Latin version of an ancient Greek phrase  

The phrase means means the god from the machine It comes from the theatre of ancient Greece which had a kind of crane for delivering gods onto the stage on wires 

By extension the term means a plot device whereby a seemingly overwhelming problem is suddenly solved by means which are arbitrary and do not follow from the logic of the narrative

For example in Euripides play Alcestis the heroine agrees to give up her own life in order to spare the life of her husband Admetus At the end Heracles shows up and seizes Alcestis from Death restoring her to life and to Admetus A more frequently cited example is Euripides Medea in which the deus ex machina is used to convey Medea who has just committed murder and infanticide away from her husband Jason to the safety and civilization of Athens

Aristotle criticized the device in his Poetics where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally following from previous action of the play

Muscle atrophy or muscle wastage is a decrease in the mass of the muscle It leads to muscle weakness since the ability to exert force is related to mass Muscle atrophy can be a partial or complete wasting away of muscle Muscular atrophy affects a major number of elderly It also develops in several common diseases including cancer AIDS congestive heart failure Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease renal failure It may be observed in Dejerine Sottas syndrome inactivity as seen when a cast is put on a limb or upon extended bed rest cachexia burns liver failure and starvation Muscular atrophy decreases quality of life as the sufferer becomes unable to perform certain tasks or worsen the risks of accidents while performing those It also increases the risks of falling in conditions such as IBM 

The exact cause of muscular atrophy is unknown but it may be due to the gradual failure in the satellite cells which help to regenerate skeletal muscle fibres and a decrease in sensitivity to or the availability of secreted growth factors which are necessary to maintain muscle mass and satellite cell survival

In muscle atrophy the normal balance between protein synthesis and protein degradation changes There is a down regulation of protein synthesis pathways and an activation of protein breakdown pathways  In the ATP dependent ubiquitinproteasome pathway particular proteins are targeted for destruction by the ligation of at least four copies of a small peptide called ubiquitin onto a substrate protein The substrate is later targeted for destruction by the proteasome 

Muscle atrophy can be treated

The Sunshine Coast is a coastal region in South East Queensland north of the Queensland capital of Brisbane On 15th March 2008 the former Councils of Noosa Shire Maroochy Shire and Caloundra City combined to form the Sunshine Coast Regional Council 

The Sunshine Coast is bordered by the Pacific Ocean in the east and extends to the local government boundaries beyond the Blackall Range to the west Sometimes the towns of Gympie which is 30 minutes drive north of Noosa Heads and Caboolture 30 minutes drive south of Caloundra have been included in a broader definition of the Sunshine Coast region

The Glass House Mountains located south west of Caloundra were first sighted by James Cook from the deck of the HM Bark Endeavour in 1770

The Sunshine Coasts first white inhabitants were three castaways who shared the life of the aborigines for eight months Later it became the home of many runaway convicts It was also the scene of some of the most bitter skirmishes of Australias Black War

Timber getters used its rivers and lakes as seaways to float out logs of cedar and prospectors climbed its mountains to reach the Gympie gold With the coming of the railway line to Gympie the coastal towns which were founded as ports for the early river trade were bypassed The Sunshine Coast later grew into a holiday destination which was further expanded in the development boom of the 1960s and 1970s 

The Sunshine Coast is a centre for tourism The attractions include Steve Irwins Australia Zoo UnderWater World marine park Aussie World with the Ettamogah Pub The Buderim Ginger Factory The Big Pineapple and the Majestic Theatre at Pomona

The Sunshine Coast contains many beaches Many well known beaches within the Sunshine Coast region are located at Noosa Heads Alexandra Headland Mooloolaba Coolum Maroochydore and Kings Beach in Caloundra

The region is also home to more national parks than any other region in Queensland The natural variety of the area has been protected by five separate parks in both coastal and inland regions including Mapleton Falls National Park Kondalilla National Park The Glasshouse Mountains National Park Noosa National Park and the Great Sandy National Park which includes sections on Fraser Island and in Cooloola near Rainbow Beach

Robert Lee Frost was an American poet He is well known for his realistic writings of rural life and his use of American informal speech His poems were often set in rural life in New England in the early twentieth century and used these settings to look at complex social and philosophical themes Frost has often been quoted by other people He was honored often during his lifetime receiving four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry

Robert Frost was born in San Francisco California to journalist William Prescott Frost Jr and Isabelle Moodie

Frosts father was a teacher and later an editor of the San Francisco Evening Bulletin and an unsuccessful candidate for city tax collector After his death on May 5 1885 the family moved across the country to Lawrence Massachusetts Frost graduated from Lawrence High School in 1892 Frosts mother joined the Swedenborgian church and had him baptized in it but he left the church as an adult 

Although he would be famous for writing about rural life Frost grew up in the city and published his first poem in his high schools magazine He attended Dartmouth College for two months long enough to be accepted into the Theta Delta Chi fraternity Frost returned home to teach and to work at different jobs

In 1894 he sold his first poem My Butterfly An Elegy for fifteen dollars Proud of this accomplishment he proposed marriage to Elinor Miriam White but she waited wanting to finish college before they married Frost then went on a trip to the Great Dismal Swamp in Virginia and asked Elinor again after returning Because she had then graduated she agreed and they were married

He attended liberal arts studies at Harvard for two years but left to support his growing family Shortly before dying Roberts grandfather purchased a farm for Robert and Elinor in Derry New Hampshire and Robert worked the farm for nine years while writing early in the mornings and producing many of the poems that would later become famous His farming was unsuccessful and he returned to education as an English teacher at New Hampshires Pinkerton Academy from 1906 to 1911 then at the New Hampshire Normal School in Plymouth New Hampshire

In 1912 Frost sailed with his family to Great Britain living first in Glasgow before settling in Beaconsfield outside London His first book of poetry A Boys Will was published the next year In England he made some important friends including Edward Thomas TE Hulme and Ezra Pound Surrounded by his peers Frost wrote some of his best work while in England

As World War I began Frost returned to America in 1915 and bought a farm in New Hampshire where he started a career of writing teaching and lecturing This family homestead was the Frosts summer home until 1938 and is used today as The Frost Place a museum and poetry conference site During the years 191620 192324 and 19271938 Frost taught English at Amherst College in Massachusetts notably encouraging his students to account for the sounds of the human voice in their writing

For forty two years from 1921 to 1963  Frost spent almost every summer and fall teaching at the Bread Loaf School of English of Middlebury College at its mountain campus at Ripton Vermont The college now owns and maintains his former Ripton farmstead as a national historic site near the Bread Loaf campus In 1921 Frost accepted a fellowship teaching post at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor where he resided until 1927 while there he was awarded a lifetime appointment at the University as a Fellow in Letters The Robert Frost Ann Arbor home is now situated at The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn Michigan Frost returned to Amherst in 1927 In 1940 he bought a convert5acreadjon plot in South Miami Florida naming it Pencil Pines he spent his winters there for the rest of his life

Harvards 1965 alumni directory says Frost received an honorary degree there Although he never graduated from college Frost received over 40 honorary degrees including ones from Princeton Oxford and Cambridge universities and was the only person to receive two honorary degrees from Dartmouth College During his lifetime the Robert Frost Middle School in Fairfax Virginia and the main library of Amherst College were named after him

Frost was 86 when he spoke and performed a reading of his poetry at the inauguration of President John F Kennedy on January 20 1961 He died in Boston two years later on January 29 1963 of complications from prostate surgery He was buried at the Old Bennington Cemetery in Bennington Vermont His epitaph quotes a line from one of his poems I had a lovers quarrel with the world

Frosts poems are analyzed in the Anthology of Modern American Poetry where it is mentioned that behind a sometimes charmingly familiar and rural front Frosts poetry frequently presents hopeless and hostile undertones which often are either unseen or unanalyzed

One of the original collections of Frost materials is found in the Special Collections department of the Jones Library in Amherst Massachusetts The collection consists of approximately twelve thousand items including original manuscript poems and letters correspondence and photographs as well as audio and visual recordings

The Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari is an auto racing circuit near the Italian town of Imola Convert40kmmi1 east of Bologna and Convert80kmmi1 east of the Ferrari factory in Maranello Often it is simply called Imola

The circuit is named after Ferraris late founder Enzo and his son Dino who had died in the 1950s Before Enzo Ferraris death in 1988 it was called Autodromo Dino Ferrari

It was the host for the Formula One San Marino Grand Prix The Italian Grand Prix has been held in Italy since the start of Formula One The race at Imola was named after the nearby Republic of San Marion After a bad crash Monza in F11978 Imola hosted the F11980 Italian Grand Prix When Formula One visits Imola it is considered the home circuit of Ferrari and a large group of tifosi come out to support the local team

Imola is one of the few major international circuits to run in an anti clockwise direction Other anti clockwise circuits include Istanbul Park Singapores Marina Bay Autdromo Jos Carlos Pace and Yas Marina Circuit

Even with the addition of the chicanes safety was a concern at the circuit One of the biggest worries was the high speed flat out Tamburello corner Tamburello was very bumpy and had very little room between the track and a concrete wall The wall protected a creek that ran behind the corner In F11987 San Marino Grand Prix Nelson Piquet had an accident at the corner during practice He missed the race due to his injuries In the F11989 San Marino Grand Prix Gerhard Berger crashed his Ferrari at Tamburello after the front wing broke The crash was so heavy the monocoque split open The car caught fire The firefighters and medical personnel went to work quickly Because of fast response Berger survived with only burns on his hands Berger only missed one race the Monaco Grand Prix Other drivers including Michele Alboreto and Riccardo Patrese also bad crashes at Tamburello corner They escaped without serious injury

In F11994 there were three serious accidents at Imola During the Friday practice Rubens Barrichello hit the fence at the Variante Bassa It was a very hard crash and he was knocked unconscious for a few minutes During the qualifying session on Saturday Austrian Roland Ratzenberger crashed at the Villeneuve Corner He hit a concrete barrier wall almost head on and was received a very bad head injury He was taken to the hospital but died from injuries In the race on Sunday 3 time World Champion Ayrton Senna hit a concrete wall at Tamburello Corner Senna was killed instantly In two unrelated accidents several spectators and mechanics were also injured during the race

In response to the deaths of Ratzenberger and Senna changes were made to try to make the circuit safer The flat out Tamburello corner was reduced in speed It was also made into a left right sweeper A gravel trap was added to the limited space on the outside of the corner Villeneuve corner was also slowed down and a gravel trap added To retain some of the character of the old circuit the slow chicane at Acqua Minerale was eliminated Many say that the new circuit configuration is not as good as it used to be as a result of the new chicanes at Tamburello and Villeneuve

Another modification made was to the Variante Alta Variante Alta is at the top of the hill leading down to Rivazza It has the hardest braking point on the lap The kerbs were very high and the drivers often hit them This often caused damage to the cars and sometimes lead to accidents Before the 2006 Grand Prix the kerbs were lowered and the turn itself was tightened to reduce speeds

Some had complained about the poor quality of the facilities at Imola San Marino Grand Prix was dropped from the Formula One championship after F12006

Following an FIA decision in August 2006 Imola did not host a Grand Prix in F12007 SAGIS is the company that owns the circuit They hoped that the race would be reinstated at the October 2006 meeting of the FIA World Motorsport Council They were planning renovations to the facility but the reinstatement was denied

The circuit has undergone major revisions The pitlane pit garages and the final corners have been updated The final left right chicane has been removed The run from Rivazza 2 to the first Tamburello chicane is flat out This is more like the old version of the circuit The pitlane has been extended and reworked The old pit garages and paddock have been completely rebuilt The circuit hopes to rejoin the F1 calendar within the next few seasons The reconstruction has been designed by German track architect Hermann Tilke

In June 2008 with most of the reconstruction work done FIA gave the track 1T rating meaning that an official F1 test can be held there But still the track needs the 1 approvial to again host a Formula One race The track also hosted the 2008 World Touring Car Championship Race of Europe on September 21 2008

The 1220s decade ran from January 1 1220 to December 31 1229

A miniseries in a serial storytelling medium is a production which tells a story in a planned limited number of episodes 

An elastic collision is when two objects collide and bounce back with little or none deformation For example two rubber balls bouncing together would be elastic Two cars hitting each other would be inelastic as the cars crumple and do not bounce back In a perfectly elastic collision no kinetic energy is lost and so the kinetic energy of the two objects after the collision is equal to their total kinetic energy before the collision Elastic collisions occur only if there is no net conversion of kinetic energy into other forms The other rule to remember when working with elastic collisions is that momentum is conserved

Consider two particles indicated by subscripts 1 and 2 Let m1 and m2 be the masses u1 and u2 be the velocities before the collision and v1 and v2 be the velocities after collision

Dont Bother Me is the first song written by George Harrison to appear on an album by The Beatles It was on the groups With the Beatles album in the UK released in 1963 and on their Meet the Beatles album in the US released in 1964

Harrison wrote the song while sick in bed at a hotel room in Bournemouth England where the Beatles were playing some shows during the summer of 1963sfnMacDonald2005p98 Harrison never regarded it highly saying It was a fairly crappy song I forgot all about it completely once it was on the albumCitation neededdateFebruary 2010 He considered it an exercise in whether he could write a song later saying at least it showed me that all I needed to do was keep on writing and then maybe eventually I would write something goodsfnThe Beatles Interview Database2010 Harrison received a writing credit for two earlier songs In Spite of All the Danger and Cry for a Shadow Both were recorded by the Beatles but neither was released officially by the band until 1995s Anthology 1 compilationsfnLewisohn1995pp6 1011 Dont Bother Me is considered Harrisons first song by most

The sullen mood and sad lyricsSo go away leave me alone dont bother mewere unusual for the Beatles at the time but would become characteristic for Harrison The song mostly stays in a minor key and achieves a thick sound through its double tracked vocal reverbed guitars and busy drumming The elaborate percussion lends the song a Latin rhythm accentuated by its stop time structure

In 1973 Miles won the silver medal at the World Junior Chess Championship at Teesside his first important event against international competition He won the title next year in Manila

Miles entered the University of Sheffield to study mathematics but dropped out to concentrate on chess

In 1976 Miles became the first ever FIDE Grandmaster born in the United Kingdom narrowly beating Raymond Keene to the title Other English players had been acknowledged as true Grandmasters in the past Howard Staunton the 19th century World Champion was obviously a grandmaster Joseph Blackburne was also regularly described as a grandmaster Naturalised German born Jacques Mieses was awarded the GM title in 1950 and Jonathan Penrose was awarded the title retrospectively For his achievement Miles won a 5000 prize

Miles had a string of good results in the late 1970s and 1980s and his success was a factor in the growth of strong British players around that timeshortly after Miles became a GM Miles won games against a number of former World Chess Champions including Vasily Smyslov Mikhail Tal and Boris Spassky In 1980 at the European Team Championship in Skara he beat reigning world champion Anatoly Karpov with black using the extremely unorthodox opening 1 e4 a6 the so called English Defence Miles beat Karpov again three years later in Bath in a game that was part of the BBCs Mastergame series but it was never shown on television due to a technicians strike However over their careers Karpov won most of the other encounters

Miles won the British Chess Championship only once in 1982 His prime time as a chess player was in the middle of the eighties In the January 1984 FIDE rating system he ranked 18 in the world with a rating of 2599 One of his best results was his win at the Tilburg tournament in 1984 The following year he tied for first there with Robert Hbner and Viktor Korchnoi playing several of his games while lying face down on a table having injured his back 

Playing on top board for England Miles helped his team to an all time best silver medal at the 1986 Chess Olympiad in Dubai But he was never able to qualify for the Candidates series for the world title and was overtaken by fellow Englishman Nigel Short in 1985

Against Garry Kasparov Miles had little success not winning a game against him and losing a 1986 match in Basel against him by the overwhelming score of 5505 Following this encounter Miles described Kasparov as a monster with a thousand eyes who sees all

After he was hospitalized because of a mental breakdown in late 1987 Miles moved to the United States He finished last in the 1988 US Championship but continued to play there and had some good results In 1991 he played in the Championship of Australia but he eventually moved back to England and began to represent his home country again He was equal first at the very strong Cappelle la Grande Open in 1994 1995 and 1997 He also won the Capablanca Memorial in Cuba three times His last tournament victory was the 2001 Canadian Open Chess Championship in Sackville New Brunswick

Miles played in the 2001 British Championship but withdrew before the final round apparently because of ill health 

The Miles Variation in the Queens Indian Defence is named after him

In his later years Miles became grossly overweight and suffered from diabetes A post mortem found that this contributed to his death by heart failure

Miles was in many ways a controversial figure Miles had his disagreements with chess authorities and with his fellow English players particularly Keene and Short Miles made accusations regarding payments that Keene had received from the British Chess Federation for acting as his second in the 1985 Interzonal tournament in Tunis Miles became rather obsessed with the affair eventually suffering a mental breakdown over it He was arrested in September 1987 in Downing Street apparently under the belief that he had to speak to then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher about the matter He was subsequently hospitalised for two months Writing in the Daily Telegraph in November 2003 Nigel Short claimed that Tony was insanely jealous of my success and his inability to accept that he was no longer Britains number one was an indication of if not a trigger for his descent into madness

Miles was also noted for his acerbic wit He often attacked chess personalities in published articles He attacked former World Champion Anatoly Karpov in an article entitled Has Karpov Lost his Marbles

The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico It was the largest marine oil spill in history The spill was caused by an oil gusher when the drilling machines exploded on April 20 2010 The explosion killed 11 workers and hurt 17 more The first tries to fix the leak did not work On July 15 the leak was stopped by putting a cap on top of the broken well pipe About 49 million barrels of crude oil spilled out before the well was fixed The amount of oil coming out of the broken well probably started at about 62000 barrels per day and gradually went down after that

The spill damaged animal and plant habitats as well as the Gulfs fishing and tourism businesses Scientists also found oil underwater that could not be seen from the top People worked to protect hundreds of miles of beaches wetlands and estuaries along the northern Gulf coast The US Government has named British Petroleum as responsible The company has paid for cleaning up and other damage By the end of 2010 the US Coast Guards Operational Scientific Advisory Team said that there were no more ocean areas needing special cleanup from the oil spill They were not sure of the condition of the shore

On May 27 2010 US President Barack Obama temporarily stopped new drilling for offshore oil rigs He also made new safety rules to try to stop other oil spills from happening British Petroleum owned the Deepwater Horizon oil rig This company was mostly responsible for the damage caused by the oil spill They paid out several billion dollars to help people who could not work after the oil spill and to pay for cleanup efforts

On May 3 2010 The Gulf Coast Claims Center began to pay for emergency help to businesses and people who could not work because of the oil spill  By the end of August 2010 The Gulf Coast Claims Center had paid more than 395 million About one third of this money was paid to the fishing industry A By February 2011 the GCCF had paid about 751 million to people in the business of fishing People will have three years to figure their costs and ask GCCF for payment

BP also started a program called the Vessels of Opportunity Program to hire local people to use their boats to help clean up the spilled oil However the program made little or no impact on the spill as the vessels were not fitted with recovery equipment 

There are more ways for those in the US fishing industry to get paid back for money they lost because of the Gulf oil spill For example the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund was started after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill to help people hurt by oil spills Another law the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act lets the US government give help when the Secretary of Commerce sees that all the fishing has failed in one place

Effects on the fishing business 

Some animals and plants were hurt by the Gulf oil spill Scientists found dead oil covered animals such as birds fish shrimp and oysters Large decaying fish covered in the thick dark oil washed up on some beaches The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found 1746 birds 1014 of these birds had oil on them 997 were dead and 749 were alive The NOAA also found 528 sea turtles with 400 dead and 128 alive The NOAA found 51 mammals including dolphins with 47 dead and 4 alive Some scientists cut open dead fish to look at the inside and found the oil was inside the gills and the heart 

Because fishing was stopped many small fishing supply stores could not make money The fishing companies did not have enough fish and lost customers Normally lots of people travel to this area to fish for fun Because of the oil spill fewer people traveled there Therefore travel businesses and people who help the visitors also lost money

East of Mobile Bay damage from oil spill cleanup crews and vehicles caused more damage to the fragile dune habitat than the oil spill itself Dune habitats can be destroyed by nothing more than light foot traffic and in no way can support the egress of 100s of vehicles being deployed Despite overwhelming supporting evidence BP still denies this and apparently has persons editing and or reverting Wikipedia articles in order to cover up collateral problems associated with the accident

Scientists have thought about how much the plants and animals in the Gulf of Mexico would be changed after the oil spill In general chemicals in oil can hurt fish and shellfish In the early life stages many kinds of fish grow near the shore Therefore oil at the shore might change how many fish there are in future years Also affected species are part of a food web or provide living areas for other kinds These things are possible but there are not yet many actual data of how the fish and shellfish are doing after the oil spill Most of the shrimp grow in one year Therefore changes in the number of shrimp caused by the Gulf oil spill will be known one or two years after the spill It takes years for many kinds of fish to grow large enough to keep for food Therefore it will take years to know the effects of the Gulf oil spill on the very small fish

The NOAA is still helping animals hurt by the Gulf oil spill However not many more are being reported Instead the NOAA is spending more time letting wildlife go back into the ocean For example sea turtles that were saved from the oil are being let back into the wild ocean NOAA scientists on research boats have also been measuring whether it is now safe to eat fish from the Gulf 

Counting done by Dauphin Island Sea Lab after the oil spill off the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama found that there were actually more of some kinds of fish a few months after the oil spill Some scientists think that the closing of fishing areas kept the total number of fish high in spite of the oil spill

One third of the oysters sold in the United States come from Louisiana However the places where oysters grow have been hurt by recent hurricanes higher than usual amounts of fresh water coming down the rivers and also the Gulf oil spill  The Louisiana Division of Wildlife and Fisheries have been working with scientists at universities on better ways to grow oysters Also in June 2011 more than 100 million oyster seeds and 500000 baby oysters were put in test areas to help the oyster areas to grow back

The US National Marine Fisheries Service thinks that the 2011 brown shrimp harvest from waters off of Mississippi and Louisiana will be only a little bit lower than usual It is expected to be a much better harvest than in 2010 after the oil spill Weather in the spring of 2011 was good for growing conditions for the brown shrimp

Lithium hydroxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is LiOH It contains lithium and hydroxide ions 

Lithium hydroxide is a white solid It can be anhydrous or hydrated It dissolves in water to make a basic solution It reacts with acids to make lithium salts 

Lithium hydroxide is made by reacting lithium carbonate with calcium hydroxide A calcium carbonate solid is made and a lithium hydroxide solution is left behind It can also be made by reacting lithium with water or by reacting lithium oxide with water

The Four Stages of Cruelty is a series of four printed engravings They were published by the English artist William Hogarth in 1751 Every print is about a different part of life of Tom Nero a fictional character

The First stage of Cruelty shows Nero when he is a child hurting a dog In the Second stage of cruelty Nero who is an adult beats his horse Then in Cruelty in perfection he becomes a robber and murders his pregnant lover At last in The reward of cruelty his body is taken from the gallows after he is execution and is cut up into pieces by surgeons

William Hogarth who had been very unhappy at the acts of cruelty that he saw on the streets of London printed the pictures for moral learning They were printed on cheap paper for poor people The pictures are rougher and more violent than Hogarths other works which usually have touches of humor He had felt he needed to do this to make people understand his message However the pictures still have the small careful details that Hogarth is famous for

Like most of his other prints such as Beer Street and Gin Lane Hogarth wanted The Four Stages of Cruelty to be a warning against cruel and evil acts and that it was easy for a small bully to become a criminal He wished to stop that barbarous treatment of animals the very sight of which renders the streets of our metropolis so distressing to every feeling mind Hogarth loved animals When he painted a portrait of himself he included his pug in the picture He also marked the graves of his dogs and birds at his home in Chiswick

Hogarth was pleased with his pictures European Magazine reported that he said to a person who sold books named Mr Sewell

In his unfinished Apology for Painters he added

In his 1817 book Shakespeare and His Times Nathan Drake said that picture in the first plate changed the opinion of people about throwing at cocks and encouraged them to be firmer about stopping the people who did these things

Some people however did not like the series very much Charles Lamb said that the series were not as good as Hogarths other works Art historian Allan Cunningham also disliked the series

Behaviorism or Behaviourism is the theory that scientific enquiry into behaviour should consist only of what can be observed such as stimuli and responses Occult qualities such as states of mind were expressly forbidden Even though it is quite obvious that internal processes of thought go on in all advanced animals certainly in man this was not allowed to play any part in sychology because it could not be directly observed 

Behaviourism says that behaviour can be studied scientifically without knowing what the physiology of an event is and without using theories such as that of the mind According to behaviourism all behaviour can be observed

People who influenced behaviorism a great deal were Ivan Pavlov Edward Lee Thorndike John B Watson and BF Skinner 

Pavlov investigated classical conditioning but did not agree with behaviourism or behaviorists Thorndike and Watson rejected introspective methods and wanted to restrict psychology to experimental methods Skinners research focused on operant conditioning

Today ideas from behaviourism are used in therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy Cognitive behaviotal therapy can help people cope with anxieties and phobias as well as with certain forms of addiction 

As a scientific theory behaviorism was largely replaced by cognitive psychology

Many changes have been made since that time The cathedral originally had Norman architecture but not much of that has survived By the end of the 13th century most of it had been changed The changes continued in the 14th century when the central tower was rebuilt Many other parts were added the last big change was the adding of the main north entrance finished in 1535 This was mostly the cathedral we see today

The Norman columns and arches of the nave have some decorations They are original done in the early 12th century In the south aisle of the nave there are two tombs dating from the 14th century tombs They are for members of the clergy but we do not know who they are There is a tomb for Sir Richard Pembridge who was a Knight of the Garter

There is a modern rood screen a big lantern and a reredos The Lady Chapel has lancet windows and lots of ornaments There is a bit of ancient ironwork in the tomb of Bishop Booth who had the porch built There is also a large Norman font The north transept was built in the Decorated Gothic It has the shrine of St Thomas of Hereford The north window has some beautiful 19th century stained glass

The tomb of the shrine of Bishop Cantilupe is built of Purbeck marble The south transept may be the oldest part of the cathedral The choir has many beautiful features There is a reredos which represents Jesus on the cross Two pointed arches show Christ with angels and the four evangelists There is also a very strange old Episcopal chair

Another famous document is one of only four copies of the Magna Carta to survive It is kept very carefully and sometimes shown to the public in the library next to the Mappa Mundi

Albert Bridge is a road bridge over the River Thames in West London It connects Chelsea on the north bank to Battersea on the south bank Designed and built in 1873 as a cable stayed bridge it proved to be structurally unsound Between 1884 and 1887 Sir Joseph Bazalgette added some elements of a suspension bridge More work was done in 1973 As a result the bridge today is a hybrid of three different design styles

Built as a toll bridge it was unsuccessful Six years after its opening it was taken into public ownership and the tolls were lifted The tollbooths remained in place and are the only surviving examples of bridge tollbooths in London Its nickname is The Trembling Lady because of its tendency to vibrate when large numbers of people walked over it Signs at the entrances warn troops from the nearby Chelsea Barracks to break step while crossing the bridge

With a roadway only convert27ftm wide and with serious structural weaknesses the bridge was ill equipped to cope with motor traffic Despite this Albert Bridge has remained open to vehicles apart from brief spells for repairs It is one of only two Thames road bridges in central London which have never been replaced 

The strengthening work did not prevent further decay of the bridges structure Strict traffic control limits its use and prolongs its life It is the least busy Thames road bridge in London except for Southwark Bridge The bridges condition continues to get worse as the result of traffic Also severe rotting of the timber deck is caused by the urine of dogs using it as a route to nearby Battersea Park

In 1992 Albert Bridge was rewired and painted in an unusual colour scheme designed to make it easy to see and avoid being hit by shipping At night it is lit by 4000 bulbs making it one of West Londons most striking landmarks

Moveable man of action or the action figure is a character figurineThey may be made from plastic or other materialsThey are often based on characters from a movie comic book video game or television program One of the most famous action figures is GI Joe

Before the 1960s toys had little or no movement The company Hasbro in 1964 came up with a new toy they called an action figure This toy was GI Joe created by Stan Weston GI Joe had a military look with changeable clothing and accessories ready for action Action figures were made to give boys a toy since Barbie in 1959 was so popular with girls Starting in the 1970s comic book superheros were made into action figures Marvel Comics and DC Comics began making their action figures to appeal to kids favorite superheroes

Hasbro spent many years getting information and drawings of military weapons and vehicles for the use of their military action figures the GIJoesThe first African American GIJoe was made in the second year of the action figures In 1967 the first female GIJoe was made she was a nurseGI Joe in 1985 got a cartoon TV show and in 2009 a movie was made Over many years Hasbro made men of action figures including people like George Washington Robert E Lee John F KennedyBob Hope etc

In the 80s the need for action figures got bigger with all the cartoons that started on TV Shows like Masters of the Universe GI Joe and Thundercats which got the attention of young boys and gave a need for the action figures of their favorite shows Hasbro got the idea for the Transformers we know today from a cartoon in Japan and brought it to the United States in 1984 cartoon episodes and then action figures soon came along

By the 1990s action figures became toys for adults as well but for the use of collecting and value These action figures came from movies TVand famous people like rock stars

From the 2000s on and up to these days there was a transition made into movies where popular movies would have action figures of their own characters And not only movies but also musicians athletes and other figures of importance in the media

Today the adult collector market for action figures is expanding with companies like McFarlane Toys Palisades and NECACompanies have given numerous movie characters musicians and athletes their very first highly detailed figures These are commonly intended as display pieces rather than toys however child oriented lines such as the Masters of the Universe revival and Justice League Unlimited still get adult collector followings as well Comic book are also able to get figures of their characters produced regardless of whether or not they appeared in movies or animated cartoons Examples of companies that produce comic figures and merchandise almost exclusively include Toy Biz and DC Direct

Adult action figure lines are often exclusive to specific chain stores rather than mass retail Popular lines often have figures available exclusively through mail in offers and comic conventions like comic con which raises their value significantly Ploys such as packaging errors and short packed figures have also been used by toy companies to increase collector interest 

Action figures are usually made of plastic These toys are able to move and hold different poses Making an action figure starts with the idea and drawing Next wire and clay models are made When a figure is approved it gets molded from a plastic Paint and fabric complete the toy

Action figures were made to give boys a toy like Barbie Unlike Barbie GI Joe was meant to be manly and strong which is why a military toy was made

Like Barbie The action figures body shows an almost unrealistic body image for boys Some action figures like the WWF wrestlers body on the action figure have unrealistic muscles These body images of strong wrestlers superhero and GI Joe tell boys that they too can grow up to be big and strong which may not always be the case

Today there are action figures for girls too Movie character action figures like Edward Cullen from the movie Twilight are collected by girls

Ring of steel is the name people use for the security cordon around the City of London Its purpose is to prevent terrorism It was designed during the IRA troubles The city of Belfast was the first to get a ring of steel

Roads entering the City are narrowed and have small chicanes to force drivers to slow down and be recorded by CCTV cameras These roads have a concrete median with a sentry box where police can stand guard and monitor traffic Tucked away out of sight may be police armed with submachine guns City planners call these precautions fortress urbanism

Some roads have been closed to traffic entirely Despite the term ring of steel the roadblocks and chicanes are actually created with concrete blocks sometimes plastic coated that are wedged together

The measures were introduced following a massive IRA bombing campaign in the City in the early 1990s such as the 1992 Baltic Exchange bombing and the 1993 Bishopsgate bombing At this time the sentry posts were guarded by armed police almost continuously Initially the ring of steel consisted of plastic cones and on duty policemen which the locals described as the ring of plastic It showed the public that the City authorities were taking seriously the threats by the IRA This was replaced by more permanent structures consisting of concrete barriers checkpoints and thousands of video cameras After the IRA ceasefire the police guard was reduced 

Following the September 11 attacks and the increased terrorist threats to the United Kingdom security has been stepped up again In December 2003 the Ring of Steel was widened to include more businesses in the City Police thought a terrorist attack on the City was inevitable

Traffic entering London is also monitored and recorded at many places by an automatic number plate recognition system It is watched all the time by police The data is stored for five years for analysis and evidence

A toll in transport is a charge for the use of a road On some motorways the driver pays at the end of the trip according to how far he has gone The idea is a very old one It has been used for hundreds of years and in many countries

The Millennium Bridge is a footbridge across the River Thames in London It is a steel suspension bridge which links Bankside with the City Its position is between Southwark Bridge and Blackfriars Railway Bridge The bridge opened on 10 June 2000 It is the newest bridge across the Thames 

Londoners nicknamed the bridge the Wobbly Bridge after people on a charity walk felt an uncomfortable swaying motion The bridge was closed later that day After two days of limited access the bridge was closed for almost two years Expensive and complicated changes were made to eliminate the wobble It was reopened in 2002

The southern end of the bridge is near Globe Theatre the Bankside Gallery and Tate Modern the north end next to the City of London School below St Pauls Cathedral The bridge alignment is such that a clear view of St Pauls south facade is presented from across the river framed by the bridge supports

The design of the bridge was the subject of a competition organized in 1996 by Southwark council The winning entry was by Arup Foster and Partners and Sir Anthony Caro The eight suspension cables are tensioned to pull with a force of 2000 tons against the piers set into each bank enough to support a working load of up to 5000 people on the bridge at one time

The closure of the bridge only three days after opening attracted consideerable public criticism as another high profile British millennium project suffered an embarrassing setback akin to how many saw the Millennium Dome There was some astonishment that engineers had not foreseen the problem as computer modelling is such a standard technique today However modifications to the bridge did eliminate the wobble which has not recurred since the bridge reopened in February 2002

The bridges movements were caused by a positive feedback phenomenon The natural sway motion of people walking caused small sideways oscillations in the bridge In turn this caused people on the bridge to sway in step increasing the amplitude of the bridge oscillations and reinforced the effect

The bridge opened on an exceptionally fine day and it was included on the route of a major charity walk On the day of opening the bridge was crossed by 90000 people with up to 2000 on the bridge at any one time

The lateral vibration problems of the Millennium Bridge are very unusual but not entirely unique Other bridges which have seen similar problems are

After extensive analysis by the engineers the problem was fixed by fitting 37 dampers to control horizontal movement and 52 dampers to control vertical movement This took from May 2001 to January 2002 and cost 5m After a period of testing the bridge was successfully re opened on 22 February 2002 The bridge has not been subject to significant vibration since In spite of the successful fix of the problem the affectionate wobbly bridge epithet remains in common usage amongst Londoners

The following is a list of Formula One constructors These are constructors which have competed or plan to compete in the FIA World Championship

In Formula One racing the terms constructor and entrant do not mean the same thing A constructor builds a car or engine An entrant is the person or corporate entity that enters a race They register a car and driver with the FIA They are responsible for making the car ready to race and keeping the car in good condition during the race weekend Because of the role and activity of the entrant the term team is often used when talking about an entrant

Under the FIA rules the constructor of an engine or chassis is the person which owns the intellectual rights to such engine or chassis Basically who ever builds an engine or a chassis in the constructor The title of Formula One World Champion Constructor is given to the car make that scores the most points during the season The make of a car includes both the chassis and engine 

If a cars chassis and engine are made by the same entity then the constructor is the car make For example Ferrari makes both the chassis and the engine So the make is Ferrari If the chassis and engine are made by different entities the cars make is both constructor names put together For example McLaren builds a chassis that uses a Mercedes engine So the make is McLaren Mercedes The name of the chassis constructor is always placed before the engine constructor 

Because both engine and chassis are included in the make name chassis run with different engines are counted as two separate makes For example Lotus Ford is a make different from Lotus BRM Each make would be scored separately The World Constructors Championship title is awarded to the constructor of the chassis of the make that scores the most points This list only shows chassis constructors for that reason For more information on engines see Formula One engines

Since the early 1980s the FIA requires that Formula One entrants own the intellectual rights to the chassis that they enter Basically that means that temas must build their own chassis Since this time the terms entrant constructor and team now mean the same thing Before this time constructors were free to sell their chassis to other teams Brabham and Lotus chassis were used by many other teams during the 1960s and 1970s Several teams than compeated with the front runners never built their own chassis Rob Walker Racing Team was the most successful example They earned the first victories in Formula One for both Cooper and Lotus 

In those days the concept of a works or factory team was the official team of the company producing the cars Customer teams were entrants that purchased their cars off the shelf In modern Formula One the team must build their own car The term customer only applies to engines now

There have been some cases since the 1980s where one company built cars for another team Lola designed and built cars for Larrousse and Scuderia Italia in the late 1980s and early 1990s

Constructors whose only entry in the World Championship was in the Indianapolis 500 from 1950 to 1960 All were American based

The nave is where the congregation sits in a church It usually has long benches called pews or separate chairs

Naves are found in humble Saxon churches and in grand Romanesque and Gothic Christian Abbeys Cathedrals and Basilicas 

The nave is the central approach to the high altar the main body of the church Nave was probably suggested by the keel shape of its vaulting The nave of a church goes from the entry to the chancel It is flanked by aisles separated from the nave by an arcade If the aisles are high and of a width comparable to the central nave the structure is sometimes said to have three naves

Hexham Abbey is an Anglican church in the town of Hexham Northumberland dedicated to St Andrew Since the Dissolution of the monasteries in 1537 the Abbey has been the parish church of Hexham

The Abbey which was a cathedral in Saxon times is part of the Diocese of Newcastle The diocese is based in Newcastle upon Tyne and includes the historic county of Northumberland in northeast England 

There has been a church on this site for over 1300 years since Etheldreda Queen of Northumbria made a grant of lands c674 The Benedictine abbey was built almost entirely of stones from nearby Roman ruins The Saxon crypt still remains as does a frith stool a 7th8th century cathedra or throne

In the year 875 Halfdene the Dane ravaged the whole of Tyneside and Hexham Church was plundered and burnt to the ground

About 1050 one Eilaf was put in charge of Hexham although as treasurer of Durham he probably never came there Eilaf was instructed to rebuild Hexham Church which then lay in utter ruin His son Eilaf II completed the work probably building in the Norman style

In Norman times the old abbey was replaced by an Augustinian priory The present church is from that period in the Early English style of architecture The choir north and south transepts and the cloisters date from this period

The east end was rebuilt in 1860 and the rest of the Abbey was largely rebuilt around 1900 This mammoth project involved re building the nave whose walls include some of the earlier church The nave was re consecrated in 1908 In 1996 an additional chapel was created at the east end of the north choir aisle Named St Wilfrids Chapel it offers a place for prayer or quiet reflection

A Chapter house or chapterhouse is a special building or room attached to a cathedral or large church It is where the cathedral chapter meetings are held Chapter houses were also built in mediaeval monasteries

In a cathedral the chapter is always chaired by the Dean whose job it is to run the cathedral Members of the chapter will include Canons who may include top lay officials as well as priests It is a management group for the cathedral

The side of the cloister with the chapter house was usually the first to be constructed it would have been started shortly after the churchs frame was put up

When part of a monastery the chapter house is usually on the eastern wing of the cloister It is a large space to hold all the monks of the monastery It is built in the same style as the churches of that day In some Romanesque or Gothic monasteries the entrance to the chapter house is a miniature version of the entrance to a cathedral

The community of monks would meet in the chapter house with the Abbot to hold chapter This meant to read aloud from the rule book and Bible and to discuss matters concerning the monastery and its monks The meetings generally took place in the morning after mass the monks would sit along the length of the walls in strict age order At the end of the meeting the monks would publicly confess their sins or denounce others

A Canon in a church is an official He may or may not be a priest The Chapter of a cathedral is an official group made up of the Dean and Chapter of canons who meet in a chapterhouse They run the cathedral especially the business affairs of the cathedral They are the body which has legal responsibility for the cathedral and for electing thebishop

Originally a canon was a cleric who lived in the precinct of the cathedral The word meant a priest who was under a bishop

In the Anglican church some canons are laypersons The title is also given to some senior or retired priests as an honorary title

A Dean is the title of a high official in a church or college 

At one time all ancient colleges were entirely run by priests In England you could not even be a student unless you were a member of a Church of England congregation In those days a Dean was a senior person who looked after the people and finance and that is usually so today But now there are two kinds of Dean

Manipuri dance covers a number of different dances from Manipur a state in the northeast corner of India The main dance types are the Laiharoaba the Samkirtana and the Rasalila The classical style of dances is described as being the most graceful of all the classical Indian dances Rabindranath Tagore used the style for his female characters in his famous dance dramas 

Manipur shares a border with Burma The people of Manipur are part of the Mongoloid group with a very rich and artistic culture

The oldest form of dance is found in the Laiharaoba festival The word Lai means God and the word Haraoba means merrymaking Laiharaoba means merrymaking of the gods The festival generally lasts for a month and is held every year in the months of May and June The Maibi community holds the Laiharaoba festival Maibis are female priests although there a some male priests too There are specific rituals that the maibis follow during the festival They dance and worship the forest gods called the Umang Lai There are also household gods for example the Sanamahi or Panthoibi All these gods are worshipped in the Laiharaoba festival The Maibis dance and show the formation of earth and life They use 364 hand gestures to show this During the festival the people of Manipur sing dance act play instruments and play sports The rituals are pre determined and all the village people participate

The instrument used in Laiharaoba is called the Pena It is a very special instrument of Manipur It is played by the Penakhongba and the tune is believed to put the Lai to sleep or used to wake him up Other tunes are also played for the dances The story of Khamba and Thoibi are played here The other stories have characters such as the Nongpokningthou and Panthoibi These are basically love stories The characters are often identified with the Hindu Gods Shiva and Parvati Though mostly based on nature worship according to the Manipuri scholars this festival has elements of Tantric Cults 

The very popular martial art of Manipur Thangpak is also a part of this festival with performances of sword and spear play Many movements of Thangpak are also part of the dances of Manipur For example the popular Khujengleibi movement in dance is found in the sword technique 

In the 18th century Manipur came under the influence of Chaitanite Vaishnavism which was a branch of Hinduism Vaishnavism made its entry in Manipur during the reign of King Charairongba During the rule of Raja Bhagyachandra Chaitanite Vaishnavism became a permanent part of Manipurs culture The Raja joined this religion and his subjects followed him Many parts of daily life changed with Vaishnavism the rituals of Vaishnavism were followed very closely by the community The gods of the religion Krishna and Radha were worshipped and temples were built all over Manipur The people started worshipping the gods with dance There were two kinds of dance that developed with the influence of this religion the Samkirtana and the Rasalila

Samkirtana is basically a male dance form in which the performers play instruments sing and dance This follows the lines of the Samkirtana as shown by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in Bengal In Manipur it has a very rich dance element along with singing and playing instruments It is an energetic and acrobatic dance The main instrument is a wooden drum the Pung which looks like the clay Khol of Bengal The sounds naturally vary The dance with the Pung called the Pung Cholom is part of the Samkirtana in Manipur The Cholom is a male dance form of Manipur The name probably comes from the word Chalan meaning way of movement There is also the Kartal Cholom where the movements are more grand and follow the sound and playing of the big cymbals the Kartalas The singing called the ishei follows the kirtana style of Bengal Singers use a trembling tone which is typical of the Manipuri style of singing The talas used have an immense variety There are 64 different talas for the Pung These rhythmic patterns are also used in interesting combinations The costumes are white but the turbans vary with the instrument players The Samkirtana is performed at all major occasions in the society such as birth ceremonies weddings and funerals It is even performed before the beginning of the Rasalila

The Rasalila of Manipur is said to be one of the higlights of India culture It is through the Rasalila that the people of Manipur reach the highest bliss of worship Following the Srimadbhagavata the core text of Chaitanite Vaishnavism the first Rasalila Maharas was composed in 1779 The story as laid down in the Bhagavata was performed in the temple A Rasamandali a circular dance area was built outside the temple and people sat around it to watch the Rasalila This still happens in the Govindaji temple beside the Palace of the Kings The success of this Rasalila made Raja Bhagyachandra try composing other Rasalilas such as the Vasantarasa and Kunjarasa The Nityaras and Divarasa are later developments of the Rasalila The performances of the Maharasa Vasantarasa and Kunjarasa are fixed in the year but Nityarasa can be performed at anytime of the year Later kings continued to develop and compose dances Raja Gambhir Singh introduced acting the stories of child Krishna in Goparasa and Udukhalrasa The time of Raja Chandrakirti can claim to be the golden age of the evolution of Manipuri dance 

Other dances of Manipur are performed during festivals like Rathayatra Holi and Kwakjatra All these dances are about religious devotion The songs that are sung with these dances speak of the glory of Krishna and Radha The main instruments are the Pung and flute

The technique of Manipuri dance is probably the most graceful of all the classical dances of India The body follows the path of 8 and the feet movements generate light touch on the ground The face has a subdued expression while the eyes mostly express the bhaktirasa or the emotion of devotion There are two styles of this dance form the tandava and the lasya In tandava we have the Cholom tandava done by men and the Krishna tandava which is a counter part of the lasya technique in Rasalila The lasya is a very graceful style in Manipur Rabindranath Tagore used this technique for the female characters in his dance dramas 

The emotional part of this dance form follows the rasa theory as written in the Vaishnava texts The pancharasa shanta dasya sakhya vatsalya and madhura are the main emotions on which the Vaishnavite Manipuri Dance is based 

Manipur stands apart from all the Indian Classical dances for the beautiful costumes of the Rasalila which is a unique creation of the people of Manipur Religion and art have merged completely in the making of dance in Manipur Even today one cannot identify Manipuri dance without the presence of the gods Krishna and Radha

It was named by paleontologist Jose Bonaparte in 1991 It walked on two legs had a long tail and its leg structure suggests that it was a fast runner It may have eaten insects It was more primitive than other better known members of its family such as Mononykus and Shuvuuia 

Alvarezsaurus was featured in the Discovery Channel television series Dinosaur Planet which speculated that it was a predator of young Saltasaurus although these species did not exist at the same time Alvarezsaurus being about 5 million years older than Saltasaurus

Aucasaurus was a medium sized theropod dinosaur from Argentina that lived during the Late Cretaceous Period It is smaller than its relative Carnotaurus It had extremely short arms Its skeleton is the most complete abelisaurid skeleton discovered so far However the skull is damaged causing some paleontologists to speculate that it was involved in a fight shortly before it died

This dinosaur was featured in the Discovery Channel series Dinosaur Planet where it was depicted as a pack hunter and ate the sauropod Saltasaurus In the episode the head injury discovered in the type specimen was interpreted as being crushed by a stumbling Saltasaurus

ISO 21482 is a norm that specifies a warning symbol to warn against the dangers of radiation The warning is made of the trefoil on the top which warns against radiations There are lines towards the bottom On the bottom left there is a skull which warns against poison On the bottom right there is a running figure and an arrow pointing outside the sign The color red was chosen because children said it expresses danger better than yellow The Gallup Organization recommended the symbol after showing it to 1650 people 

The new symbol does not replace the old one but it amends it It was designed to show the danger of radiation to people who do not know about radiation or who do not know the symbol for it The symbol was developed because of nuclear accidents that happened because people opened containers with radioactive materials such as the Goinia accident in 1987 or the Samut Prakan disaster near Bangkok in 2000 The new symbol will not be placed on the containers Rather it will directly placed on the substances emmitting radiation of the highest categories 1 to 3 Containers will continue to bear only the old symbol as they do not pose a direct risk This also applies to rooms with radiation sources or x ray equipment in them

Constitutional economics is a program of joint study of economics and constitutionalism It is often described as the economic analysis of constitutional law Constitutional economics tries to explain the selection of different constitutional rules limiting the choices and activities of economic and political agencies This is different from the approach of traditional economics Also constitutional economics studies how well economic decisions of the state agree with the existing constitutional economic rights of its citizens For example proper distribution of economic and financial resources of the state is a big question for every nation Constitutional economics helps finding a legal mechanism to solve this problem

The term constitutional economics was created in 1982 by the US economist Richard McKenzie Then it was used by another American economist James M Buchanan as a name for a new academic sub discipline It was Buchanans work on this sub discipline that in 1986 brought him the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision making

Buchanan rejects any organic conception of the state as superior in wisdom to the citizens of this state This philosophical position forms the basis of constitutional economics Buchanan believes that every constitution is created for at least several generations of citizens Therefore it must be able to balance interests of the state society and each individual 

There exists an important opinion by Ludwig Van den Hauwe that constitutional economics can be regarded as the modern science of legislation 

The constantly growing public interest in constitutional economics has already brought to life several academic journals such as for example Constitutional Political Economy

The US judge Richard Posner stresses the important role of state constitution in the economic development He asserts that effective protection of basic economic rights promotes economic growth

The Supreme Court of India used practical interpretation of the Indian Constitution to protect the poorest and most oppressed groups of the population in several cases of public interest litigation This is a good example of real life application of the methodology of constitutional economics

In the English language the word constitution in addition to meaning Fundamental Law often refers to the set of basic principles that a commercial religious or public organization is governed by This understanding is reflected in a broader approach which is characteristic of the Western school of constitutional economics As opposed to that the Russian school of constitutional economics created at the turn of Millennium focuses entirely on the concept of state constitution The Russian model of constitutional economics tries bringing together constitutional economic rights of the citizens and economic policy of the state In 2006 the Russian Academy of Sciences has officially recognized constitutional economics as a separate academic sub discipline 

Constitutional economics pays special attention to such topic as proper national wealth distribution Many countries with changing or developing economic systems still regard their constitutions as abstract legal documents having nothing in common with actual economic policy of the state Three quarters of all independent states are still living under nearly absolute state control of the national economy Neither civil society nor individual citizens in these states have any influence on the decisions taken in the process of national wealth distribution Therefore constitutional economics is especially important for the countries whose political and economic systems are in transition and where the state rarely respects constitutional economic rights of its citizens

The struggle for existence is a natural history metaphor It refers to the competition between animals to survive It was first used by the Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus and again by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace

The idea is much older and many natural historians have noted the competition between animals Generally speaking they have been interested in the competition between species Malthus was probably the first to think about the struggle for resources between members of one species the human species

Darwin first heard about Malthus in letters from his sister Fanny while he was voyaging on HMS Beagle Fanny told him Malthus ideas were being promoted by Harriet Martineau an early feminist writerp153 Later on back in London Darwin met Martineau over dinner and put a lot of thought into the ideas of Malthus The number of humans could double in 25 years If they did not it was because of competition for resources such as food or because wars and disease became more common

Darwin began to realise that every species of living thing has the potential to increase geometrically yet that does not happen in practice Later he combined these ideas with two more One was the idea that in the struggle some would be better suited than others to succeedp264268 The other idea was heredity that the characteristics must be at least partly inherited This led to his idea of evolution by means of natural selection Wallace independently came to the same conclusion

Darwin used the phrase struggle for existence as the title of the third chapter of his Origin of Species in 1859 The old idea was now fitted into a complete theory

Thomas Robert Malthus FRS was a British writer on political economy and population Malthus popularised the economic theory of rent and was the first to use the phrase struggle for existence

Malthus is famous for his theories about population its increase or decrease in response to various factors There were six editions of his An Essay on the Principle of Population published from 1798 to 1826 He said that sooner or later population gets checked by famine disease and widespread mortality 

He wrote in opposition to many who saw society as improving and as perfectibleviii William Godwin and the Marquis de Condorcet for example believed in the possibility of almost limitless improvement of society So in a more complex way did Jean Jacques Rousseau whose notions centered on the goodness of man and the liberty of citizens bound only by the social contract

Malthus thought that the dangers of population growth would prevent endless progress towards a utopian society 

As an Anglican clergyman Malthus saw this situation as divinely imposed to teach virtuous behaviourp104105 Believing that one could not change human nature Malthus wrote 

 that the increase of population is necessarily limited by the means of subsistence  that population does invariably increase when the means of subsistence increase and  that the superior power of population is repressed and the actual population kept equal to the means of subsistence by misery and vicep61

Malthus placed the longer term stability of the economy above short term expediency He criticised the Poor Lawsp39 45 and supported the Corn Laws which introduced a system of taxes on British imports of wheatpxx He thought these measures would encourage domestic production and so promote long term benefits 

Malthus became hugely influential and controversial in economic political social and scientific thought Many evolutionary biologists read him especially Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace For both of them Malthusianism became a stepping stone to the idea of natural selection Malthus is still a writer of great significance and controversy

This page is for testing out a new system where we give different levels of easy and hard to understand articles The topic for this page is Earth For comments on this page see the discussion page   

Earth is a planet It is the planet on which we live It is the third planet of the solar system 71 of the surface of earth is covered with water Earth has one moon

Please add some text easier than level 3 but more encyclopaedic than level 1

Earth is the planet we live on It has only one Moon Every 365 days it revolves around the Sun which provides light Earth rotates so each part of it is in light during the day and dark at night The Moon revolves but the same side of it is always facing Earth It has phases of the Moon which are caused by the position of the Earth compared with the Moon and the Sun if the Earth is between them the moon appears illuminated and if the Earth is behind the Moon it appears dark The lunar calendar is based on this

Earth has air that we live in water that we drink and much light reaches it from the sun Everything alive needs these so Earth is at least rare and it cannot be easily replaced It has many ecosystems that provide natures services to humans The value of these when measured is natural capital Unlike any other style of capital there is no known way to replace this  but it can be improved regrown protected for example by conservation

Earth is a planet It is the planet on which we live It is the third planet of the solar system 71 of the surface of earth is covered with water Earth has one moon

The aim of Level 05 is to teach some Simple English using a interesting and worthwhile topic such as the Earth as study material 

It is asserted that this is better than trying to mindlessly learn lists of nouns or verbs out of context

Ideally Level 05 lessons should cover all the words in Basic English using the minimum number of pages This is an excrutiatingly difficult task but the Wikipedia software looks as if it might make it possible Wikipedia software has lots and lots of cross links which according to the Special pages can be sorted and view in many different ways

Level 05 lessons try to do many things at once so that you cover a lot of material yetbut everything in connected together in a meaningful way
