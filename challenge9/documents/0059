Spiders are arachnid arthropods They have eight legs and most make silk Some of them have six eyes some of them have eight eyes some have four eyes two eyes or no eyes Spiders are the biggest group in arachnids after Acarina the mites and ticks Some spiders are as small as 05 mmBJ Kaston How to Know the Spiders p 37ref and some are as large as 10cm in body length Most spiders eat insects other spiders etc They catch the insects and other prey in several ways Some build a spider web and some use a thread of silk that they throw at the insect Some kinds of spiders hide in holes in the ground then run out and grab an insect that walks by Others will make web nets to throw at passing insects Or they will even go out and attack them with no webs at all Spiders do not have wings Some can jump quite well and hunt by sneaking close to an insect and then jumping on it

Few spiders are dangerous to humans They have fangs like a hypodermic needle that they use to bite people and push venom into them The venom usually causes pain The venom of a few kinds of spiders may kill a person especially one who is very young or not in good health

Being afraid of spiders is a very common phobia but spiders generally run away from bigger animals and most of them will only bite to get something to eat or to defend themselves or their nests The widow spiders never willingly leave their webs so usually people get bitten when they touch the spider by mistake but they are the spiders that kill the most people every year Its just because there are so many of these dangerous spiders all over the world There are spiders that are larger more aggressive and that have deadlier bites but there are not so many of them and they are not found all over the world 

The smallest of full grown spiders can be less than 4 mm The largest of spiders can have a body length of 10 cm or more The largest can weigh 150 grams The largest of spiders are the tarantulas and the huntsman spiders Some huntsman spiders in South East Asia can have a leg span of around 250300 mm

Spiders generally capture insects and other arthropods It is rare for spiders to capture prey that are much larger than they are It is also difficult for most spiders to capture prey that are very much smaller than they are Most species of spiders cannot live close together because they treat each other as their next meal but there are some spiders that form colonies Spiders eat not only spiders of other species but spiders of their own species Although the earliest spiders came before birds and mammals some spiders of today will eat small fish small birds and even small mammals 

The Black widow spider got it name because its females sometimes eat the males that mate with them but it is very common in the spider world for females to eat males after mating Spiders need to learn whether other spiders they meet with are possible mates or just possible dinners So each species has its own way of asking and telling other spiders they may meet Because of the danger of being eaten in some species of spiders the males have special hooks on their front legs with which they hold the female while they mate Others bring the female something to eat There are a few species in which the male spiders construct their own little webs that are connected to the webs of the females In these species the male is so much smaller than the female that it would be difficult for her to actually capture the male

Most spiders have such poor vision that they will not even notice a dead insect Jumping spiders are one exception to this rule They have such good vision that they can find recently dead flies or other insects to eat

Most spiders are predators but the jumping spider Bagheera kiplingi gets over 90 of its food from fairly solid plant material produced by acacias as part of a beneficial relationship with a species of ant 

Young spiders of several families feed on plant nectar Studies have shown that they do this for long periods They also clean themselves periodically while feeding These spiders also prefer sugar solutions to plain water which shows that they are looking for nutrients Many spiders are nocturnal they are most active during the night The extent of nectar consumption by spiders may therefore have been under estimated Nectar contains amino acids lipids vitamins and minerals in addition to sugars Studies have shown that other spider species live longer when nectar is available Feeding on nectar also avoids the risks of struggles with prey and the costs of producing venom and digestive enzymes

Various species are known to feed on dead arthropods web silk and their own shed exoskeletons Pollen caught in webs may also be eaten and studies have shown that young spiders have a better chance of survival if they have the opportunity to eat pollen In captivity several spider species are also known to feed on bananas marmalade milk egg yolk and sausages

Even a relatively large spider can have fangs with very sharp points The fangs are hollow needles just like the needles used to give shots The hypodermic needle is the picture is the kind used for insulin injections and for other such medicines Spiders use their fangs to inject toxins that kill the insects they will eat Some kinds of spider venom attack the nervous systems of their prey and other kinds of venom attack body tissues When people get bitten by spiders of the genus Loxosceles they can get deep dead spots where they were bitten and have big scars later on

Most spiders have four pairs of eyes on the top front area of the body arranged in patterns that vary from one family to another The main eyes at the front are capable of forming images Jumping spiders visual acuity exceeds by a factor of ten that of dragonflies which have by far the best vision among insects Human eye are only about five times sharper than a jumping spiders They achieve this by a telephoto like series of lenses a four layer retina and the ability to swivel their eyes and integrate images from different stages in the scan The downside is that the scanning and integrating processes are relatively slow

Spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors Various sensors mostly bristles respond to touch from strong contact to very weak air currents Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell Spiders also have in the joints of their limbs sensors that detect forces and vibrations In web building spiders all these mechanical and chemical sensors are more important than the eyes while the eyes are most important to spiders that hunt actively Like most arthropods spiders lack balance sensors and rely on their eyes to tell them which way is up 

Most spiders are predators they capture prey But spiders use very many different ways of catching things

The best known method spiders use to capture prey is a sticky web The placement of the web allows different spiders to trap different insects in the same area Flat horizontal webs allow them to trap insects that fly up from vegetation underneath for example Flat vertical nets allow them to trap insects in flight The spiders that build webs usually do not see very well but they are very sensitive to vibrations

Females of the water spider Argyroneta aquatica build underwater diving bell webs which they fill with air and use eating their prey molting mating and raising offspring They live almost entirely within the bells darting out to catch prey animals that touch the bell or the threads that anchor it A few spiders use the surfaces of lakes and ponds as webs detecting trapped insects by the vibrations that these cause while struggling

Net casting spiders weave only small webs but then manipulate them to trap prey They stretch their webs and then release them when prey strike them Those of the family Deinopidae weave even smaller webs hold them outstretched between their first two pairs of legs and lunge and push the webs as much as twice their own body length to trap prey and this move may increase the webs area by a factor of up to ten Experiments have shown that Deinopis spinosus has two different techniques for trapping prey backwards strikes to catch flying insects whose vibrations it detects and forward strikes to catch ground walking prey that it sees These two techniques have also been observed in other deinopids Walking insects form most of the prey of most deinopids but one population of Deinopis subrufus appears to live mainly on tipulid flies that they catch with the backwards strike

Mature female bolas spiders of the genus Mastophora build webs that consist of only a single trapeze line which they patrol They also construct a bolas made of a single thread tipped with a large ball of very wet sticky silk They emit chemicals that resemble the pheromones of moths and then swing the bolas at the moths They catch about the same weight of insects per night as web weaving spiders of similar size The spiders eat the bolas if they have not made a kill in about 30 minutes rest for a while and then make new bolas Juveniles and adult males are much smaller and do not make bolas Instead they release different pheromones that attract moth flies and catch them with their front pairs of legs

The primitive Liphistiidae the trapdoor spiders and many tarantulas are ambush predators that lurk in burrows often closed by trapdoors and often surrounded by networks of silk threads that alert these spiders to the presence of prey Other ambush predators do without such aids including many crab spiders and a few species that prey on bees which see ultraviolet can adjust their ultraviolet reflectance to match the flowers in which they are lurking Wolf spiders jumping spiders fishing spiders and some crab spiders capture prey by chasing it and rely mainly on vision to locate prey 

Not all spiders use silk to net their prey Instead these spiders may capture insects by grabbing them and then biting them Among these kinds of spiders the two best known genera are the wolf spiders and the jumping spiders

A Wolf spider will usually wait until an insect comes near to it and then rush at the insect grab it using its front legs and then bite the insect so that its venom can do its work 

Female Wolf spiders lay their eggs on a pad of silk and then draw the edges together to create a round ball that they carry along with them wherever they go They hold their egg balls to their tail ends by using their silk When the eggs hatch the little spiders will crawl onto the mothers back and she will carry them along with her for days or weeks 

Wolf spiders are very good mothers and will strongly protect both their egg balls and their infants When the time comes the little spiders will leave the mother and each will go its own way

Jumping spiders have very good eyes They can see very well They sneak as close to an insect as they can and then they jump onto the insect and immediately bite it Since they often hunt in trees bushes and on the sides of walls if the jumping spider misses it may fall off But they have a way to save themselves from harm Before they jump they fasten their silk to the place where they have been standing and as they jump they let out a silk safety line So if they fall they will catch themselves when they reach the end of their silk safety line Sometimes a jumping spider will catch an insect and then fall while still holding onto the insect But the spider is still safe

Jumping spiders make little silken tents for themselves to sleep in When they lay eggs they keep them inside such a shelter They do not take their eggs with them when they go out to hunt 

For all male spiders it is dangerous to seek a mate The female spider may not realize that the male is a spider of her kind so she may try to eat it The jumping spiders not only have visual patterns that identify them to each other but the male jumping spider will do a special dance when it approaches a female of the same species That way the female can recognize that it is a male of her species She will generally forget about eating for long enough to mate with the visiting male spider

Jumping spiders have such good eyes that they will usually watch any human who tries to watch them Some species are very shy and will run away if the human gets too close But some species such as Phidippus audax and Platycryptus undatus can become calm if the human comes close to them slowly Sometimes they will jump onto one of your fingers and then jump from finger to finger and from hand to hand They seem to want to explore

Some jumping spiders of the genus Portia hunt other spiders in ways that seem intelligent outflanking their victims or luring them from their webs Laboratory studies show that Portias instinctive tactics are only starting points for a trial and error approach from which these spiders learn very quickly how to overcome new prey species However they seem to be relatively slow thinkers which is not surprising as their brains are vastly smaller than those of mammalian predators

Ant mimicking spiders face several challenges they generally develop slimmer abdomens and false waists to mimic the three distinct regions of an ants body they wave the first pair of legs in form to their heads to mimic antennae which spiders lack and to conceal the fact that they have eight legs rather than six They have large color patches round one pair of eyes to disguise the fact that they generally have eight simple eyes while ants have two compound eyes they cover their bodies with reflective hairs to resemble the shiny bodies of ants In some spider species males and females mimic different ant species as female spiders are usually much larger than males 

Ant mimicking spiders also modify their behavior to resemble that of the target species of ant for example many adopt a zig zag pattern of movement ant mimicking jumping spiders avoid jumping and spiders of the genus Synemosyna walk on the outer edges of leaves in the same way as Pseudomyrmex Ant mimicry in many spiders and other arthropods may be for protection from predators that hunt by sight including birds lizards and spiders However several ant mimicking spiders prey either on ants or on the ants livestock such as aphids When at rest the ant mimicking crab spider Amyciaea does not closely resemble Oecophylla but while hunting it imitates the behavior of a dying ant to attract worker ants After a kill some ant mimicking spiders hold their victims between themselves and large groups of ants to avoid being attacked

Of the 40000 spiders less than 12 are known to be dangerous to humans Most of the time being bitten by a spider is painful Most spiders use venom to paralyse their prey they kill it through eating or through a bite A few spiders have venoms that can be dangerous to weakened people and those allergic to it Since 1927 13 people have died after a bite from a Atrax robustus spider from Australia

It is sometimes said that most spiders are too small for them to bite humans Nobody knows how many individual spiders there are of various sizes If we only talk about size since the largest spiders are about 10 cm and the smallest spiders are about 05 mm the average size must be about 5 cm or two inches in body length But the spider that kills the most people the Black widow and other spiders in the genus Latrodextus are around 1 cm in body length So spiders from 0 cm up to 1 cm might be too small to bite but spiders from 1 cm to 10 cm are big enough to bite Most of the spiders that people see in everyday life are big enough to bite but they hardly ever bite people and when most of them do bite people there are no serious consequences The Atrax and Phoneutria spiders which are also capable of killing people both average around 25 cm or one inch and even the Widow spiders are large enough to be easily noticed So it is true that the spiders that are dangerous are fairly large

Even relatively small spiders like Phidippus audax can give a painful bite if you hurt them but spiders are very helpful to human beings because they control insects that eat our crops

Grass is a type of plant A common kind of grass is used to cover the ground in a lawn If it gets too cold or dry lawn grass turns brown 

There is a family of plants called the grass family The plants in the grass family are called grasses but many are different from lawn grass A few of the other plants in the grass family are corn plants wheat plants rushes reeds rice barley oats millet papyrus water chestnut crabgrass and many other important types of plants Grass has thin green leaves that are called blades Many grasses are short but some grasses like bamboo can grow very tall Plants from the grass family can grow in many places even if they are very cold or very dry

Grasses are an important food for many animals like deer buffalo cows mice grasshoppers caterpillars and many others Without grass dirt can wash away into rivers this is called erosion Sometimes grasss roots keep trees from growing very fast so it is better to plant clover under trees

Lawn grass is often planted on sports fields and in the area around a building Many chemicals and a lot of water is used to grow lawn grass This usually happens in suburbs

People have used grasses for a long time People eat parts of grasses Corn wheat barley oats rice and millet are common grains used for food and to make alcohol such as beer Sugar comes from sugar cane which is also a plant in the grass family People have grown grasses as food for farm animals for about 10000 years Grasses have also been used to make paper for more than 4000 years People use bamboo to build houses fences furniture flutes and other things Grass plants can also be used as fuel to cover roofs and to weave baskets

In English the word grass appears in several phrases For example

The Cacao tree is a small tree originally in tropical South America It is small and only grows to 4 to 8 metres in height Its seeds are called cocoa and are used to produce cocoa butter the chocolate drink as well as chocolate Nowadays the trees are grown in plantations in many tropical countries

Cacao is planted on over 70000 square kilometres worldwide with 40 of production coming from Cte dIvoire Ghana and Indonesia Each country produces about 15 with smaller amounts coming from Brazil Nigeria and Cameroon

A tree begins to bear fruit when it is 4 or 5 years old In one year when mature it may have 6000 flowers but only about 20 pods About 300 600 seeds are required to produce around 1 kg of cocoa paste 

There are three main cultivar groups of cacao beans used to make cocoa and chocolate The most prized rare and expensive is the Criollo Group the cocoa bean used by the Maya Only 10 of chocolate is made from the Criollo which is less bitter and more aromatic than any other bean The cacao bean in 80 of chocolate is made using beans of the Forastero Group Forastero trees are significantly hardier than Criollo trees resulting in cheaper cacao beans Trinitario a hybrid of Criollo and Forastero is used in about 10 of chocolate For details of processing see cocoa

Cacao beans were commonly used as currency in Pre Columbian Mesoamerica In some areas such as Yucatn they were still used in place of small coins as late as the 1840s

Mahabad is a city in Iran It is in the north west of the country The city is south of Lake Urmia in a narrow valley 1300 metres above sea level It is in West Azarbaijan Province It has about 162434 people who live in the city Mahabad is connected by road with Tabriz 300 km north Urmia 150 km north and Irbil in Iraq Mahabad has also a branch of Islamic Azad University

The city is one center and symbol of the Kurdish nationalism The reason is because 1945 it was the capital of the new founded peoples Republic of Mahabad The republic was conquered by Iranian forces in 16 December 1946 The president was Qazi Muhammad The majority of the population is Kurdish During the revolution in Iran at 3 September 1979 the city was bombed and occupied by Iranian forces After the death of Shivan Qaderi a student and opposition activist in July 9 2005 the Kurdish population protested against the Iranian government

Shivan Qaderi was a student and opposition activist in Iran After his death in 2005 the Kurds protested and the Iranian government had to send more than 100000 soldiers to this region The Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran reported that about 50000 people had protested after his death on the Chuwarchira Square Humans Rights First say that after he was shot Iranian soldiers tied Ghaderis body to a military vehicle and dragged it through the city obviously trying to frighten the population so that they would not organize any more protests

Sauce is a hot or a cold liquid that is added to another food to add flavor to it Sauces are not eaten by themselves they are always added to another dish A sauce can be something simple like liquid butter or something fancier like a sauce with cream and ham or with ground meat or even with herbs and garlic

An example would be a tomato based sauce that is usually poured over spaghetti before it is eaten Gravy is a brown sauce served with meat

Spaghetti is a long string shaped kind of pasta

The word spaghetti was first used in 1849 as sparghetti in Eliza Actons Modern Cookery It comes from Italian spaghetto which means string twine

Spaghetti is made from wheat noodles which are boiled in water for a short time Spaghetti can either be served as a side dish or as a main dish As a main dish a sauce is added There are many different kinds of sauces Simpler ones are made of butter more complicated ones include tomatos garlic olive oil and various other herbs Different varieties with mussels fish or meat also exist Ground Parmesan cheese is often added 

In Italy the sauce is usually mixed with the spaghetti while they are being prepared Usually spaghetti are eaten only with a fork or with a fork and a spoon Sometimes they are cut with a knife for small children Many Italians see using a knife to eat spaghetti as bad manners except to prepare them for small children

There is a legend about how spaghetti came to Italy In the legend Marco Polo found spaghetti in China during his visit in 1295 and he took some back to Italy 

Today spaghetti is eaten everywhere In the United States there is a kind of spaghetti called Alvaros spaghetti which is served with alfredo sauce In some countrieslike United States or Canada meatballs are often in the spaghetti sauce

In China spaghetti is often made by hand In Italy spaghetti is made with a machine so that large amounts can be made quickly Italy is the biggest producer and consumer of spaghetti in the world 

Spaghetti is called by other words when it has a different thickness spaghettini spaghetti and spaghettoni

The Emperor Penguin is a penguin that lives in Antarctica It is the tallest and heaviest penguin They are the only birds that can lay their eggs on ice

Emperor Penguins are about convert11mft0lkonabbron tall and weigh up to convert45kglb0lkonabbron Emperor Penguins are black and white like all penguins and the sides of their neck are golden

They eat mostly crustaceans such as krill but also eat fish and squid

Emperors live in the coldest climate on earth Temperatures can drop as low as 140 degrees Fahrenheit on the Antarctic ice They breed at the beginning of the Antarctic winter on the ice all around the Antarctic continent They live in large groups called colonies that can have up to 20000 birds They huddle close together to keep warm Emperor penguins live for about 20 years although some have been known to live for 40 years

The shape of their body helps them to survive They have short wings that help them swim and to dive up to convert900ftm0lkonabbron to catch larger fish The deepest dive recorded is convert525mft0lkonabbron They can swim up to convert15kmhmph0lkonabbron for a short time which lets them escape their main enemy the leopard seal They can stay warm because they have a thick layer of blubber The layer of downy feathers trap air that keeps the body heat in and cold air and water out They also have large amounts of body oil that help in keeping them dry in the water 

While they are very fast in the water on land the birds can only walk very slowly On ice they can lie on their stomachs and use their wings to slide along like a toboggan

Emperor penguins spend most of their time in the water coming to the shore to breed There is nothing on the ice to make a nest so after the female lays her one egg in winter the male puts the egg on his feet to keep it warm until spring This can be from 65 to 75 days He has a special fold of skin on his stomach which can fold over and cover the egg to keep it warm This is a difficult action to swap the egg from the female to the male if it sits for too long on the ice it will freeze He does not eat during this time and can lose up to half his weight To keep warm all the male penguins huddle together Those on the outside of the group will slowly shuffle their way into the middle the group is always moving and can move as much as convert200myd0lkonabbron in 24 hours The female comes back in spring when the egg hatches while the male will go back to sea to eat but comes back to help look after the chick The chick lives on its parents feet for about 50 days until it becomes strong enough to survive the cold

The Australian movie Happy Feet was based on the story of an Emperor Penguin who is unable to sing and get a mate because he was left for too long on the ice when still an egg

The Snares Penguin also known as the Snares Crested Penguin and the Snares Islands Penguin is a penguin from New Zealand

Chuar chira Square is a known square in center of city of Mahabad where after Iranian invasion in 1947 Qazi Muhammad the president of Republic of Mahabad was hanged in public as well as other leaders of the republic in Mahabad and Bukan In 2005 the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran reported that about 50000 persons had demonstrated against the Iranian gouverment The reason was the death of Shivan Qaderi 

It is now officially called Shardari Square This square is one of the oldest places of Mahabad city

The Siege of Jerusalem took place from September 20 to October 2 1187 It was part of the war called the Third Crusade

Balian of Ibelin defended Jerusalem against the armies of Saladin

A fictionalized version of the siege is seen in the movie Kingdom of Heaven directed by Ridley Scott

The Beer Hall Putsch was a failed coup detat in Munich Germany between the evening of November 8 and the morning of November 9 1923 The Nazi Party under Adolf Hitler tried to take over the government of Bavaria a state in Germany after taking several hundred people hostage in a beer hall Several Nazis died when they got into a gun fight with police officers in another part of Munich and Hitler went to jail afterwards for about eight months

Hitler chose this time for many reasons The Weimar Republic of Germany was weak because of fighting between right and left wing parties Inflation had also left the Weimar Republic with very little support from the people or money to keep working This happened because when Germany lost World War I other countries made Germany pay for the entire war and Germany had to make taxes very high so it could pay for the war This hurt the economy of Germany

The Nazi Party was getting very strong Hitler was a strong leader In 1923 the year when the Weimar Republic was least popular the Nazi Party grew from 6000 members to 55000 members

Hitler also wanted to copy Mussolini who had taken power in Italy by marching into Rome

8 November 1923  Hitler and his men charged into the Beer Hall and forced the people there to support him Hitlers men the SA took over the Army Headquarters but forgot to take over the telegraph office This meant that anybody could call in the police

9 November 1923  19 Nazis were killed in a gunfight between the Nazis and the police in Residenzstrae Hitler was arrested two days later

Hitler and several of his friends were taken to court for treason because they took up arms against the government In the end Hitler was sent to prison for about eight months and the Nazi Party broke up

More people learned about Hitler Before this happened he was unknown But after this he was a hero to many Many Germans at that time wanted a strong leadership after the governments of the Weimar Republic

Hitler also took the time he had to spend in prison to write a book called Mein Kampf or My Struggle It sold millions and told people about his ideas Mein Kampf also made Hitler popular

Hitler also had to re think his strategy He realised he could not take power the same way that Mussolini had done Instead he had to get power through being elected

The people who died during the Putsch are seen as the first to die for the Nazi Party and are mentioned in Mein Kampf as Martyrs

Verona is a town in the Veneto region in Italy with 260000 inhabitants It is famous for being the setting for the Shakespeare play Romeo and Juliet

Kyiv or Kiev is the capital city of the country of Ukraine Almost three million people live there

Harare is the capital of Zimbabwe It is home to over 16 million people It started as Salisbury in 1890 and was known by that name until April 18 1982

The Seventh day Adventist Church is a regular Protestant Christian denomination or church but it has some beliefs that are different from most other Protestant denominations The Seventh day Adventist Church is also called the SDA church Although SDA is commonly used Adventist is the churchs own officially preferred shortening of Seventh day Adventist It came from the Millerite group which included people from many denominations The Millerites started in the 19th century after the year 1800 The Millerites were people who followed the teachings of William Miller Miller preached that Jesus is coming very soon in the Second Coming or Second Advent That is why the church that came from them called themselves Adventists The SDA Church also believe that the day we should worship God is Saturday They call this day Sabbath like the Bible does It is the seventh day of the week That is why they are called Seventh day Adventists

Important teachings include the unconscious state of the dead and the doctrine of an investigative judgment The church also focuses on diet and health its holistic understanding of the person its promotion of religious liberty and its conservative principles and lifestyle

The Seventh day Adventists also think many of Ellen G Whites writings were important She was a dedicated Christian who believed she got visions from God about the end of the world and what heaven will be like As Seventh day Adventists they believe that they should not eat unclean foods like pig certain fish and animals that the Bible names as unclean They practice healthy eating vegetarianism and staying away from things they think are immoral smoking drinking or doing anything to harm what they consider the Temple Of God or their bodies

A National Geographic article printed in November of 2005 said that Seventh day Adventists were one of the groups of people in the world that live the longest because of the way they take care of their bodies The Seventh day Adventist community in Loma Linda CA was also mentioned in the book The Blue Zones which features parts of the world where people commonly live past the age of 100

The Seventh day Adventist Church is organized with a representative form of church government and the world wide Church has 13 Divisions 

The Seventh day Adventist World Church Statistics show a growing church with 15660347 members as of December 31 2007 

The Adventist News Network reported in June 2010 that Seventh day Adventists reached a membership of 16300000 according to the churchs Office of Archives and Statistics The world church Secretary stated that when counting unbaptized children and family members who attend services the church numbers between 25 and 30 million 

Seventh day Adventists uphold the central doctrines of Protestant Christianity the Trinity the incarnation the virgin birth the substitutionary atonement justification by faith creation original sin the second coming the resurrection of the dead and last judgment

The official teachings of the Seventh day Adventist denomination are expressed in the Seventh day Adventist 28 Fundamental Beliefs This statement of beliefs was originally adopted by the General Conference in 1980 with an additional belief being added in 2005 

In Seventh day Adventists Answer Questions on Doctrine Adventists outlined the core doctrines that they hold in common with mainstream Christianity In Common With Conservative Christians and the Historic Protestant Creeds We Believe 

Adventist doctrine resembles trinitarian Protestant theology with premillennial and Arminian emphases Adventists uphold teachings such as the infallibility of Scripture the substitutionary atonement the resurrection of the dead and justification by faith alone and are therefore often considered evangelical

1661 was a common year starting on a Saturday in the Gregorian calendar and a common year starting on a Tuesday in the Julian calendar

1005 was a common year when the Julian calendar was used It was the fifth year of the 2nd millennium and the 11th century

1003 was a common year when the Julian calendar was used It was the third year of the 2nd millennium and the 11th century

Fuzzy logic is a sort of computer logic that is different from boolean algebra It is different in the way that it allows values to be more accurate than on or off While boolean logic only allows true or false fuzzy logic allows all things in between An example of this could be a computer game A person is standing in a doorway while a thing explodes The character is hit or not hit if boolean logic is used but the doorway protects him from the explosion Therefore he might only be hit 20 and takes less damage

To put it in more precise mathematical terms classical logic has two values These values are usually called false or true With fuzzy logic a value of 08 or 0971 is possible It is important to know the difference between fuzzy logic and chance A coin that is thrown has a chance of 05 for landing heads up If it is thrown 1000 times it is expected that it will land with heads side up 500 times With fuzzy logic a thing with a truth value of 05 will have a value of 05 no matter how many times it is done It is not a 50 chance of true or untrue it is 50 true and 50 untrue at the same time Fuzzy logic is used a lot in expert systems and neural networks

Humans tend to use a combination of predicate logic and fuzzy logic If you are an outfielder catching a baseball hit into the air then your precise logic will calculate trajectory and start you running to the point of intercept However once close to the ball the eyes brain of the outfielder lacks the ability to accurately estimate distance and speed because the ball is coming straight at the outfielder The human brain switches to fuzzy logic that says get me closer get me closer and so on That is why you see outfielders in baseball run to a spot and then move around as the ball gets closer

Predicate logic says calculate the point to be at to catch the ball Fuzzy logic says because of wind or other things you might not be in the correct place so just keep getting closer until you catch the ball 

In predicate logic it is the mathematics of calculating the path of the ball that determines your action In fuzzy logic it is the error of your calculations that determines your action

In effect its like your brain trying to control your finger to pick your nose while traveling down a bumpy road

Nursing is a job focused on helping peoples health

In Greece hundreds of years ago sick people went to temples where men and women helped them They made medicines from flowers and other things In the fifth century BC about 24000 years ago one of the Greeks Hippocrates was very interested about why people became ill He wrote over 70 books and was one of the first people in the world to study healthcare This is why he is often called the father of Western medicine

Religion was also important in the history of nursing Jesus Christ taught that sick people should be helped In the Middle Ages the Christian church opened more hospitals The Muslims opened some in Baghdad and Damascus too Muslim hospitals helped people from any country or religion

The Gleiwitz incident was a planned German attack against the radio station Sender Gleiwitz in the German town of Gliwice on the night of August 31 1939 This attack along with other Nazi activities was used to make people think that Poland attacked Germany and that Poland not Germany started World War II

Free means two different things If what is called free is something that is not alive that means that it is being given away by someone who does not want any money in return Often things that are free in this way are given away as add ons to something that is paid for For example an eating place may give away a free glass of water with a paid meal

If what is called free is a person that means that it is able to be what it wants to be or to do what it wants to do without being ordered around 

Most people want to be free But many strong people would like to order around people who are weaker than they are This leads to many fights

Some countries have laws that try to keep the strong people from pushing around other people too much These countries are called free countries

Animals other than people can fall into both definitions of freedom Maybe a neighbor has a cat who has just given birth to a group of kittens and so she will try to give away her free kittens That is the first kind of freedom listed above But if one of the free kittens finds a good home is fed well and grows up into a cat then maybe one day the cat will wander freely around its house and yard That is the second kind of freedom

Mackinac Island is an island in Lake Huron It is part of the US state of Michigan and is 8 miles around

Many people go to see Mackinac Island in the summer because the island passed a local law that says that no one can use a car on the island Everybody has to ride a horse or a bicycle In recent years young people have been using roller skates or roller blades to get around the island There is a narrow paved road that follows the 8 miles of shoreline This road is for horses bicycles skates and joggers or just people taking a long walk 

In order to get to Mackinac Island visitors have to buy a ticket on a ferry boat The boat ride has views of Lake Huron and the Mackinac Bridge After they get to Mackinac Island many visitors buy locally made fudge

Of note is an endemic subspecies of the omul fish It is fished smoked and sold on all markets around the lake For many travellers on the Trans Siberian railway purchasing smoked omul is one of the highlights of the long journey

Baikal also hosts a species of seals Baikal seal or nerpa

Bears and deer can be watched and hunted by Baikal coasts

Salmon is a kind of teleost fish There are many different kinds of salmon Salmon belong to the same family of fish as the trout Most kinds of salmon live in salt water or migrate between rivers and the sea Many people like to eat salmon so the fish is also grown in fish farms Usual ways to make food out of salmon are smoking cold smoking and graving Salmon are killed by people other fish and their environment

Thousands of years ago there were already people in Drenthe Around 3500 BC people made dolmens piles of big stones 53 of the 54 dolmens in the Netherlands are in Drenthe Most of them are in the northeast of the province

The oldest paper with the name Drenthe on it is from 820 It was called Pago Treanth Papers from 1024 and 1025 show that is was a county at that time 

From 1046 until 1528 the bishops of Utrecht ruled over Drenthe From 1581 until 1795 it was part of the Republic of the Seven United Provinces but Drenthe itself was not a province In 1796 under the Batavian Republic Drenthe was a province for the first time

In the Second World War the nazis build a concentration camp near Westerbork From there they put Dutch Jews on the train to other camps in Germany and Poland In the last train from Westerbork was also Anne Frank She was a Jewish girl and she wrote a diary She died in the concentration camp Bergen Belsen in Germany After the war her diary became world famous

Since the 1990s there are twelve municipalities in Drenthe

The most importantcn cities are Assen Emmen Meppel and Hoogeveen In Drenthe there is many heathland

In Drenthe many people speak Low Saxon dialects The dialects in Drenthe are called Drents These dialects are different in each town or village

D is short for Day in military terms and D Day signifies a particular date when a major operation was to begin The days before a D Day is signified as D 1 D 2 D 3 etc and the days after a D Day are D1 D2 D3 etc

There were many days in military history that were called D Day The most famous D Day was June 6 1944 when the biggest amphibious attack in military history took place in Normandy France during World War II This attack was codenamed Operation Overlord The Allies attacked Nazi German occupied Europe It was very important for the Allied success in World War II though many men were lost when the beaches were taken over After that about two months later after very hard fighting and many killed the Allies won They freed France from the Germans Less than one year later Germany surrendered June 6 is very important to many people because of what happened

Many people think D Day stands for Decision Day but it does not the first letter is just to show the importance of the day

Funk is a type of music from the United States that was developed the 1960s by African American musicians and singers such as James Brown Sly and the Family Stone George Clinton and The Meters Funk music emphasizes the rhythm of the music Funk music mixes Rhythm and Blues music with soul music Funk music is dance music

Funk uses many rhythm instruments such as electric guitar bass guitar drums and electric organ Funk bands also have a horn section which includes several saxophone players a trumpet player and in some bands a trombone player

In funk music the electric bass has a more important role than in other styles of popular music Many funk songs are based on a strong bass line played by the electric bass player Well known funk bass players include Bootsy Collins Louis Johnson and Larry Graham of Sly the Family Stone Larry Graham invented a new style of electric bass playing called slap bass technique With this technique the bass player slaps and plucks the strings to create a strong rhythm

The United States singer and musician James Brown was one of the first funk musicians James Brown recorded a song in 1967 called Cold Sweat which is considered the first funk song Other musical groups copied the rhythms and musical style developed by James Brown and his band A band called The Meters played funk music in New Orleans The Meters had hit songs such as Sophisticated Cissy and Cissy Strut in 1969 Another funk group The Isley Brothers had a hit song in 1969 called Its Your Thing

abzy

In the 1980s funk music changed Funk musicians began using electronic instruments such as synthesizer keyboards and electronic drum machines instead of electric bass electric organ trumpets saxophones and drums Rick James had hits in the 1980s with funk songs such as Give It To Me Baby and Super Freak The band Queen had funk songs such as Another One Bites The Dust The musician and singer Prince had hit songs

Some major names of early 80s funk include Cameo Zapp The Gap Band The Bar Kays and The Dazz Band

In the later 1980s two new styles of funk developed called funk rock and funk metal These styles of music mixed funk music with rock and metal music Funk rock and funk metal bands include Red Hot Chili Peppers Living Colour Janes Addiction Prince Primus Fishbone Faith No More and Rage Against the Machine

Funk music influenced 1980s hip hop music Many hip hop musicians use funk songs by James Brown or George Clinton to compose new hip hop songs

In the 1990s and 2000s funk rock bands included Outkast and Van Hunt As well 1990s and 2000s hip hop musicians continue to use funk songs by James Brown or George Clinton to compose new hip hop songs

The Great white shark is a species of shark This fish is a good swimmer and the worlds largest predatory fish

Great white sharks have about 3000 teeth arranged in many rows The first two rows of the teeth are used for grabbing and cutting the animals they eat while the other teeth in the last rows replace the front teeth when these are broken worn down or fall out The teeth have the shape of a triangle with jags on the edges Great white sharks eat fish and other animals for example seals and sea lions

The back of the shark has a grey color and the underside is colored white The sharks have three main fins the dorsal and two pectoral fins There are five gill slits on great white sharks The great white becomes adult about nine years after its birth The growth of the great white shark is about 25 30 centimetres per year and they grow to an average size of 45 meters The largest can be as much as 65 meters in length

Great white sharks live in the sea They live near the coast in all warm waters They occasionally make dives into the deep water of open oceans They can be in water as shallow as three feet deep and as deep as 1280 metres

They may swim near

Research has shown that the sharks of northern California are genetically different to other shark populations DNA evidence shows the population separated from other great whites about 200000 years ago and they have not mixed again By tagging the sharks they also learned that they are generally alone but follow the same route through the ocean and stay in the same places From January to July they live near Hawaii and then move to Californian waters between August and December

Sometimes sharks attack human beings but they do not do it because they like to eat people When sharks see some new object for example a surfboard they bite it to know what kind of object it might be Sometimes sharks see the shadow of surfers and attack them because they think they are seals

Some people think that humans are not good food for great white sharks because the sharks digestion might be too slow to cope with the human bodys high ratio of bone to muscle and fat It might be argued that because of this nearly all attacks by great whites do not continue after the first bite 

However the more likely answer given that this shark is an opportunistic predator which is not very discriminating in what it consumes is that the sharks tactics generally involve biting its prey once so that the prey bleeds to death before the shark moves in to feed This tactic is commonly observed on other large mammalian prey such as seals and dolphins and minimizes the risk of injury to the shark In most cases humans tend to escape quickly after the first bite so are not wholly or partially consumed simply bitten Deaths in such cases are generally caused by loss of blood from the first wound In cases where attacks have occurred and the victim has been unable to escape quickly partial or whole consumption has occurred lone divers are especially at risk of this It is said that most attacks also occur in waters where it is hard to see or where the shark is confused but this is unlikely given that the shark is in its natural hunting environment with highly developed super senses

Emotions are what people feel A scientific definition is not simple but includes three things

Here is one definition

In evolutionary terms emotions are very ancient and involve body systems which have operated for hundreds of millions of years These are the hormone system the autonomic nervous system and the lower brain centres

Dyslexia is a very common problem and has an effect on the way our brain understands words The most common signs of dyslexia are reading and writing problems Estimates are that in the United States between five and nine percent of schoolchildren have dyslexia though estimates go as high as fifty percent 

A person can have dyslexia even if he or she is very smart or educated Recent studies show that there are many small business owners that have dyslexia between 35 and 50 percent of U S and British entrepreneurs are affected Researchers think that many dyslexic entrepreneurs are successful because they can delegate responsibilities and still be good at speaking 

At the end of the 20th century scientists did a lot of research about dyslexia and found some of the reasons that people are dyslexic A professor who did research in the 1980s and 1990s looked at the brains of dyslexic people who had died He found that some parts of the brain were not connected very well and that this happened during the fourth month of pregnancy This problem has a big effect on the left half of the brain The newest research shows that three genes are the reason for dyslexia 

One thing that causes dyslexia is a problem with the central hearing nerve This problem can not be found with a normal hearing test so a special doctor has to do special tests to find it It means that people with heavy dyslexia are sensitive to loud noise may have problems speaking and may not be able to concentrate It may also cause problems with rhythm and melody of music

In order to tell if a child has dyslexia he or she has to be seen by a doctor A child can be called dyslexic if he or she cannot read or write well and there is no other reason for the problem Doctors are trying to create early tests to help find out whether a child has dyslexia before they are old enough to go to school If this happens a child can start to be treated very early and they may have fewer problems at school Many well known people have dyslexia such as Whoopi Goldberg Keira Knightley Susan Hampshire Orlando Bloom Keanu Reeves Richard Branson Henry Winkler Patrick Dempsey and Tom Cruise

Children with dyslexia can be helped One way teachers help dyslexic students is to break words into different sounds The student must learn how to write the different sounds and create words This helps with reading and writing Some people believe that dyslexic children can read and write better if they put pieces of colored paper on top of what they are reading

The AK 47 is a Russian assault rifle designed in 1947 by Mikhail Kalashnikov and first used in 1949 It and an updated version called the AKM were used by the Soviet Unions Military It was later replaced by the AK 74 The AK 47 quickly became famous and spread all around the world because it was simple to fire clean and maintain and also because of its reliability The AK 47 and its successors continue to be used by many of the worlds armies Many terrorist and insurgent groups also use the AK 47 It is a cheap reliable and easy to use weapon The AK 47 was also available with a folding stock the AKS 47 and a shortened version with the AKS74 folding stock the AKMSU although this was soon replaced by the AKS74U which fires the 545 cartridge of the AK 74 There was also a light machine gun variant with a longer barrel and different shaped stock called the RPK 

The AK 47 uses Gas operated reloading When the bullet is moved down the barrel a little bit of the gas behind the bullet is made to go up a small tube that pushes away the bolt This is special because the person who is shooting the gun does not have to reload with their hand every time that they want to shoot  the gun reloads by itself

The AK 47 used many simple ideas that were first invented for the German Sturmgewehr 44 WW2 assault rifle The AK 47 is a common gun used by many groups because it is so cheap and available One of the reasons it is so common is that the Soviets left many behind when they left Afghanistan in 1989 after invading it in 1979 The letters AK stand for Avtomat Kalashnikova which is Russian for Kalashnikovs Automatic Rifle It shoots the Soviet 762x39mm cartridge It is only accurate up to 300 meters After that the bullet starts to tumble and drop

Erzsbet Bthory Elizabeth Bathory in English was a countess in what is now Transylvania

She is the most famous serial murderer in Slovak and Hungarian history She was accused of torturing and killing many girls and young women It is unknown how many women she killed Her diary supposedly says that there were 650 people that she killed but there may have been more or less

She was born in present day Hungary on August 7 1560 and died on August 21 1614 in achtice in present day Slovakia

She spent her childhood at the Ecsed Castle At the age of 11 she was forced to be engaged with the fighter Francis Ndasdy In 1575 she married Ndasdy In 1578 he became the chief commander of Hungarian troops in their war against the Turks He was known as a very brave but also very cruel person

Ndasdys wedding gift to Elizabeth was his home the achtice Castle along with the achtice country house and seventeen nearby towns The castle itself was surrounded by a peasant village and rolling hills In 1602 Elizabeths husband bought the castle from the emperor Rudolf II so that it became a property of the Ndasdys Since battles with the Turks kept her husband away from the castle Elizabeth became the lady of the castle It is rare but not unheard for historians to claim her husband was ignorant of her crimes 

Elizabeth had six children however two of them died at an early agefactdateJuly 2010

Her husband died in 1602factdateJuly 2010 Her guilt is disputed by some such as Lazlo Nagy who says she was victim of a governmentchurch plot The King of Hungary it has been pointed out owed her money And Count Gyorgy Thurzo the person who brought her to trial also stood to gain from downfall her estates would belong to him in that event 

In 2008 a movie was made about her called Bathory starring Anna Friel It differs from others in that it takes the stance that she was innocent of the charge of being a serial killer although she is still portrayed as being cruel

Phonology is the science that studies the sound patterns of language Phonology is part of linguistics which is the scientific study of language

Linguistics is the science that studies language Scientists who study language are called linguists

An important part of the field of linguistics divides language into many levels to study it The smallest part of any language is the phoneme which are sounds in language Speech is studied in the field known as phonetics This is followed by the structure of sounds in words studied under phonology The structure of words is studied in morphology and the structure of sentences is studied as part of syntax The study of meaning in language is known as semantics and finally the study of meaning in context is known as pragmatics Discourse analysis is the study of entire conversations or texts 

Linguistics studies one language next to another to find similar properties Doing that makes it possible to find things shared by all the languages of the world Linguists who study how languages are structured and how they work are said to study theoretical linguistics

Another part of linguistics is involved in understanding how languages are used in society or in the world Sociolinguistics studies how language is used in society and historical linguistics studies how languages change over time and how languages were in the past One part of historical linguistics is known as etymology where people study the history of word 

The part of linguistics which aims to find out how languages works in the mind is known as psycholinguistics

Caesium is the chemical element with the atomic number 55 on the periodic table Its symbol is Cs

Caesium is an alkali metal Its melting point is low It is extremely reactive Because of its high reactivity it is a dangerous chemical It may set itself on fire in air It explodes on contact with water It reacts more violently than the other alkali metals with water Because of this caesium is stored in mineral oil

Caesium is a rare element Since there is little caesium on the Earth it is rather expensive The human body does not need caesium In large amounts it is mildly poisonous because it is close to potassium which the body does need

Caesium was first described in 1861 by Gustav Robert Kirchhoff and Robert Wilhelm Bunsen They were testing mineral water from Bad Drkheim After they separated calcium strontium magnesium and lithium they saw two lines in the blue range of the spectometry Because of these lines they concluded that in addition to the elements already found there must be another unknown substance in the mineral water They named this substance caesium after the color blue

Caesium has at least 39 known isotopes ranging in atomic mass from 112 to 151 Only one of these sup133Cs is stable Therefore the naturally occurring isotope of caesium is sup133Cs which is not radioactive sup133Cs is used in atomic clocks its vibration frequency used to define the length of the second Another isotope sup137Cs is not made naturally but is made after nuclear fission has been done It is very radioactive and used as an industrial gamma ray source 

Caesium forms compounds with many other chemical elements Caesium formate is used in oil drilling because of its high density

Rubidium is chemical element 37 on the periodic table Its symbol is Rb Its atomic mass is 8547 It has 37 protons and 37 electrons It is a soft silver colored metal It was first discovered in 1861 by Robert Wilhelm Bunsen and G Kirchoff in Heidelberg Germany

Rubidium melts at a very low temperature for example it could melt in a persons hand Rubidium is an alkali metal It can make an amalgam with mercury

Rubidium is very reactive It will ignite in air because it reacts with many other elements in the air like oxygen and nitrogen Rubidium reacts very violently with water to make hydrogen and rubidium hydroxide a strong corrosive base The reaction is normally very hot so the hydrogen ignites 

Rubidium forms chemical compounds in only one oxidation state 1 Some rubidium compounds have a mixed oxidation state though Rubidium chloride is the most common rubidium compound Rubidium hydroxide and rubidium carbonate are also used commonly Rubidium compounds makes a red violet color in a flame Most rubidium compounds are colorless Rubidium compounds are not as common as other alkali metal compounds

 FileRubidium chlorideJPGRubidium chloride 

Rubidium is about as common as zinc It is the 23rd most common element in the Earths crust Most minerals only have a small amount of rubidium in them It normally comes in small quantities in other minerals It is made by reduction of rubidium ores with calcium It is expensive because calcium is difficult to make and the rubidium needs to be kept in argon and away from water or air

There are not many common uses for rubidium Rubidium compounds are sometimes used in purple fireworks It and its compounds are used mainly in science research though It is also used to make superoxide ions It is used in some special types of glass 

Rubidium compounds are not very dangerous in the human body however if a person gets too much from eating they could get sick because it acts like other alkali metal ions such as sodium ions in sodium chloride 

Rubidium is very dangerous It reacts with air and water and makes corrosive substances

Barium is chemical element 56 on the periodic table Its symbol is Ba It contains 56 protons and 56 electrons Its mass number is about 1373 It is a metal

Barium is part of a group of elements known as the alkaline earth metals It is a silvery metal that easily turns black It is soft and ductile It can form alloys with some metals that are partially alloys and partially chemical compounds

Barium is reactive and if you put pure barium metal in the air it will react with oxygen At first it will turn black then white as barium oxide is formed Barium reacts with water to make barium hydroxide and hydrogen gas Barium also reacts very fast with acids to make a barium salt and hydrogen Barium can form barium peroxide if it is burned in air 

Barium reacts with many other metal oxides and sulfides to make barium oxide or sulfide and the metal It also reacts with carbon and nitrogen at a high temperature to make barium cyanide

Barium is too reactive as a metal so it is not found in the earth as a metal It is found in chemical compounds Barium only occurs in one oxidation state 2 Most barium compounds are colorless The ones that dissolve in water or stomach acid are very toxic Barium sulfate is well known because it does not dissolve in water or acids Barium compounds are quite heavy Barium compounds put out a greenish flame when heated red hot  FileBarium chloride dihydratejpgBarium chloride FileBariumsulfatpulverpngBarium sulfate 

Barium is found as barium sulfate and barium carbonate in the ground Both of these minerals do not dissolve in water Barium sulfate hardly dissolves in anything Barium is found mainly in China Germany India Morocco and the US 

It is very hard to get barium from barium sulfate So barium sulfate is reduced by carbon to make barium sulfide and carbon dioxide The barium sulfide is dissolved in hydrochloric acid This makes hydrogen sulfide and barium chloride The barium chloride is melted and electrolyzed to get liquid barium metal The barium metal is solidified and stored in oil

Barium carbonate the other ore of barium is dissolved in hydrochloric acid to make barium chloride and carbon dioxide The barium chloride is melted and electrolyzed making barium metal

Barium is used to remove oxygen from cathode ray tubes and vacuum tubes It is placed inside and reacts with all of the oxygen using it up Barium is also used in spark plug wire 

Certain compounds of barium such as barium sulfate are not toxic and can be put in the body We can see where the barium travels in the body by X rays and this can tell us whether there are problems such as blockages The barium sulfate stops the X rays from going and makes a picture Barium sulfate can be used as a pigment too

Other barium compounds have several other uses

Barium is a very toxic element though and is dangerous There is a really small amount of barium in our food and this does not cause problems If we get barium from other places though it can cause many problems Even 1 gram of barium can kill you It is dangerous because it acts like other really important elements such as calcium and magnesium If barium replaces these elements it messes up the body

Scandium is chemical element number 21 on the periodic table Its symbol is Sc

Scandium is a metal in a group known as the transition metals It is also a rare earth metal What this means is that there is not very much scandium found in the earth Because of this the pure metal can be expensive The pure metal is very reactive and will react with other elements like oxygen The metal turns from shiny to gray

Scandium is not very dangerous because there is not much of it on Earth so there is not enough of it to harm us It does not have many uses Its main use is perhaps as a component in Mercury vapor lamps Such lamps are used to light Stadiums

Vanadium is chemical element 23 on the periodic table Its symbol is V

Vanadium is a metal and is part of the group known as the transition metals It is mostly used in steel where it helps strengthen the steel metal

The human body may require a little bit of vanadium even though scientists are not really sure There is a little bit of vanadium in vitamins just to make sure that we do not get sick

Vanadium can react with a variety of other elements and the chemical compounds it forms often have beautiful colors

Arsenic is chemical element 33 on the periodic table Its symbol is As Its atomic number is 33 and its atomic mass is 7402 It is in the pnictogen group on the periodic table

Arsenic is found in three allotropes Gray arsenic is the most common It is a brittle somewhat soft metalloid that is a little shiny It has a density of 573gcm3 It is a semiconductor Yellow arsenic is unstable and rare It is the most toxic allotrope It is a soft and waxy nonmetal similar to white phosphorus It turns into gray arsenic in light Its density is 197gcm3 much lighter than gray arsenic It is made when arsenic vapor is cooled very fast by something like liquid nitrogen Black arsenic is similar to red phosphorus It is a brittle black and shiny nonmetal It does not conduct electricity Since gray arsenic is the most common it is usually referred to as arsenic 

Arsenic is found as one stable isotope 75As There are about 33 radioactive isotopes found The longest lasting one is 73As which has a half life of about 80 days

Arsenic is a moderately unreactive element similar to copper in reactivity It burns in air to make garlic smelling arsenic trioxide Arsenic as well as some of its compounds do not have a liquid state they sublime Arsenic reacts with fluorine to make arsenic pentafluoride It reacts with the rest of the halogens to make the arsenic trihalides Arsenic does not dissolve in hydrochloric acid It dissolves in concentrated nitric acid to make arsenic acid and in dilute nitric acid to make arsenious acid It reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid to make arsenic trioxide Arsenic burns with a pale lavender flame

Arsenic forms chemical compounds in three oxidation states 3 3 and 5 3 compounds are reducing agents They are the main form of arsenic in the ground Arsine is a colorless highly toxic gas with a garlic odor The 3 state is the most common They are weak oxidizing agents Arsenic trioxide is a white solid It dissolves in water to make a solution of arsenious acid The arsenic trichlorides are low melting covalent solids The 5 state is common too They are strong oxidizing agents Arsenic pentafluoride a colorless and highly reactive gas is the only stable arsenic pentahalide Arsenic pentoxide dissolves in water to make arsenic acid which can make arsenate salts

Arsenic is found as a less toxic variety in fish and mushrooms Some people think that humans need very small amounts of arsenic to be healthy Some bacteria can use arsenic instead of phosphorus for some things they are called arsenic bacteria

Most arsenic is made from the waste products after other metals are processed Only China actually mines arsenic

Arsenic is made from arsenopyrite by heating it This makes arsenic trioxide which sublimes while the iron oxide stays behind The arsenic trioxide is condensed while the sulfur dioxide does not condense The arsenic trioxide can be reduced with carbon Another way is to heat the arsenopyrite without air Then gray arsenic is made Realgar can be heated to make arsenic trioxide as well

Arsenic was known since antiquity It was alloyed with bronze to make the bronze harder Some people used arsenic as make up although it was toxic Arsenic was well known as a poison Since people used it to kill royalty and it was hard to detect it was called the Poison of Kings and the King of Poisons An arsenic compound could have been the first organometallic compound

Arsenic compounds were used as a preservative for wood Once people saw how toxic arsenic was they stopped using it to preserve wood Some feed for animals had arsenic in it to prevent disease Lead arsenate was used as an insecticide in orchards but damaged the brains of those who put the insecticide on the trees

Arsenic was used in medicines in the 1700s 1800s and 1900s Arsenic trioxide was used to treat cancer Very tiny doses of arsenic compounds can act as stimulants Some arsenic compounds are used as poison gases 

Arsenic as an element is used in alloys The lead in lead acid batteries has some arsenic in it to make it stronger Some semiconductors have arsenic in them

Copper arsenate was used as a coloring for sweets Paris green a green pigment having arsenic in it made many people sick Some bullets have arsenic in them Arsenic is sometimes added to brass to prevent the zinc from coming out Arsenic was used in optical glass but was taken out because it was toxic

Arsenic and its compounds are highly toxic They are carcinogens Water near arsenic mines is normally contaminated with arsenic Wood that was preserved with arsenic compounds can leach arsenic into the soil Emissions from coke ovens have arsenic in them

Manganese is chemical element 25 on the periodic table It symbol is Mn It has 25 protons Its mass number is 5494

Manganese is a silvery gray metal and is part of the group known as the transition metals It is similar to iron It is hard to melt but easy to oxidize Manganese forms chemical compounds in several oxidation states 2 4 and 7 are the most common 2 compounds are pink or light brown Manganese chloride is a common example 4 compounds are black and rarer Manganese oxide is an example They are oxidizing agents 7 compounds are purple black and powerful oxidizing agents Potassium permanganate is an example Manganese compounds can be black brown pink red green blue and purple FileManganese chloride tetrahydratejpgManganese chloride in 2 oxidation state FileManganese oxidejpgManganese oxide in 4 oxidation state FilePotassium permanganate samplejpgPotassium permanganate in 7 oxidation state 

Manganese is sometimes found alloyed with iron naturally These rocks called meteorites came from space Pyrolusite is one of the main sources of manganese It also occurs as manganese carbonate Some silicates have manganese in them

Manganese is normally made in an alloy with steel This is made by mixing manganese ore and iron ore in a furnace and reducing it with carbon This forms an alloy called ferromanganese Pure manganese is made by reacting the manganese ore with sulfuric acid and electrolyzing it

Manganese is used a lot in steel to make it stronger This is the main use for manganese metal Manganese compounds particularly manganese oxide are used in alkaline cells and Leclanche cells Manganese metal is also alloyed with aluminium 

Our bodies and plants need manganese to work right If we do not get enough manganese we can get sick We get manganese from our food and vitamins also have some manganese to make sure that we get enough

Manganese dust can irritate lungs Some manganese compounds cause toxicity when ingested Manganese is less toxic than nickel or copper Permanganates are the most toxic manganese compounds When someone is exposed to manganese for a long time it can cause a problem with the nervous system

Gallium is chemical element 31 on the periodic table 

Gallium is a metal but is has some unusual properties If it is held in a persons hand it will melt Gallium does not conduct electricity well and is known as a semiconductor That means gallium can be used in computers to make them work It is very shiny so it is used to paint mirrors when melted

While not considered toxic the safety data about gallium are inconclusive Some sources suggest that it may cause dermatitis from prolonged exposure Other tests have not caused a positive reaction Like most metals finely divided gallium loses its luster and powdered gallium appears gray So when gallium is handled with bare hands the extremely fine dispersion of liquid gallium droplets which results from wetting skin with the metal may appear as a gray skin stainCitation neededdateSeptember 2010

Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchyov listen IPA xruof commonly spelled in English as Khrushchev April 15 1894 September 11 1971 was the leader of the Soviet Union after the death of Joseph Stalin He ruled from 1953 1964

Nikita was born in the town of Kalinovka in Russia He later moved to Ukraine He worked in mines and became part of the Bolshevik movement 

He moved his way up in the Communist Party eventually becoming trusted by Premier Joseph Stalin When Stalin died Khrushchev became the leader of the Soviet Union

He died of a heart attack on September 11 1971

When Nikita became the leader of the Soviet Union he began something he called De Stalinization In early 1956 he took down all posters and statues of Joseph Stalin Also he moved Stalins grave to a place where people could not see it and burying it 10 feet

He also had better contacts with the western countries like the USA Britain and France This means the USSR and the west were friendlier He visited America in 1959

But the USSR and the US still did not trust each other In 1962 America and the USSR had problems over missiles being in Cuba and could have had a war Khrushchev had bargained with the Americans to get rid of the missiles in Turkey for the missiles in Cuba for only way of withdrawal

Methane is a hydrocarbon that is a gas at room temperature Its molecular formula is CH4 so it has one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms in a molecule It is often found as the main part of natural gas Methane is a greenhouse gas 22 times more effective than carbon dioxide It is also less stable and slowly oxidates by oxygen to carbon dioxide and water 

Methane is used in gas taps in places such as chemistry classrooms laboratories etc as it burns very easily because of its simple molecular structure

Methanes molecular structure is very simple It is a single carbon atom surrounded by four hydrogen atoms

Methane can be produced by many chemical methods but usually is found in natural gas and is obtained by fractional distillation after it is become liquid

Dance Dance Revolution is a series of video games made by Konami in which players step on arrows on a large pad or mat to match the arrows on screen The arrows are in time with the music Because players are moving themselves along to the music they look like they are dancing There is a large variety of music

There is a bar at the top of the screen If players make mistakes the bar gets smaller If players do not make mistakes the bar grows The game ends if the player makes too many mistakes 

Players can choose between three levels They are called light standard and heavy Light is easy and heavy is hard On some of the newer games there is a beginner mode which is very easy and a challenge mode which is very hard

Players are graded by their performance in letters based on the length of the bar at the end

From DDR SuperNOVA to later versions the levels are called beginner basic difficult expert and challenge

If the player gets an AA on the last stage in Expert Heavy or Challenge they can play an extra stage This one is sudden death though meaning one wrong step fails the game

Some educators even believe DDR should be in schools as exercise

Aruba is an island in the Caribbean Sea just a short distance north of the Venezuelan Paraguan Peninsula and it forms a part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands Unlike much of the Caribbean region it has a dry climate and an arid cactus strewn landscape This climate has helped tourism however as visitors to the island can reliably expect warm sunny weather

The island broke off from the Netherlands Antilles in 1986 hoping to gain its independence by 1996 In 1990 that effort stopped at the request of the island itself

The island came into the news after high school senior Natalee Holloway disappeared on a high school graduation trip on May 30 2005

Andalusia or Andaluca in southern Spain is one of 17 regions of Spain

Andalusia is part of the so called Autonomous communities of Spain It is the first in population among the Autonomous communities and the second in area With 7975672 people and eight provinces it is a well known region in Europe The capital is Seville with 705000 inhabitants and 1350000 in the metropolitan area Another big city is Malaga with 560000 inhabitants and 1075000 in the metropolitan area Other famous Andalusian cities are Cordoba Granada Almeria Cadiz Jaen Huelva Jerez and Marbella The most important river is the Guadalquivir and the highest mountain in Andalusia and in the Iberian Peninsula is the Mulhacen

The name Andalusia is the modern version of the name Al Andalus which goes back to the Middle Ages During that period northern Iberian Peninsula was controlled by Christian kings and the southern Iberian Peninsula was controlled by Muslims In 711 CE the Muslims invaded the Iberian Peninsula then controlled by Christians of Visigothic origin By 719 the Muslims conquered all of the peninsula except for a small area in the northern Pyrenees Mountains The Muslims used the name Al Andalus for all of the territory of the Iberian Peninsula under their control Christians in the north waged war for more than seven centuries against the Muslims gradually taking over more and more of the southern areas This process of war is called the reconquista Spanish for reconquest In the year 1492 King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain retook the last stronghold in the southern area at Granada In that same year the Muslims and Jews were forced to leave Spain

The Andalusians are the inhabitants of Andalusia of the southern region in Iberia peninsula They are generally considered an ethnically distinct peoples because of the two of the most important markers of distinctiveness their own language and an awareness of a presumed common origin Andalusian is said to be a distinct dialect of Spanish although it is debatable according to the nationalists The Andalusians have a rich culture which includes the famous flamenco style of music and dance even though it was adopted by the Spanish gypsies who have changed it and monopolized into their own culture

Some names and types are Florida bass Florida largemouth smallmouth green bass bigmouth bucketmouth linesides Oswego bass and green trout 

The largemouth is a fish which generally has greenish to brownish sides with a dark line which goes from the head to the tail Its the largest member of the sunfish family 

It prefers clear still waters with aquatic vegetation A lot of food and cover must also be there Also they can tolerate a wide range of water clarities and bottom types prefer water temperatures from 20 to 30C and are usually found at depths less than 20 feet 

The feeding habits of bass change with its size Young fish mainly feed on microscopic animals Fingerling bass eat insects and small fishes Adult bass will eat whatever is available including fish crabs frogs salamanders snakes mice turtles and even birds 

Age and growth  Growth rates are highly variable with differences attributed mainly to their food supply and length of growing season Female bass live longer than males and are much more likely to reach trophy size By age two or three females grow much faster than male bass At five years of age females may be twice the weight of males The oldest bass from Florida whose age has been determined by fisheries biologists was 16 years of age

The largemouth bass is a very popular fresh water game fish Much of its popularity is due to its aggressive attitude and willingness to strike a lure or bait with explosive force They can be caught with almost every bait The value of the largemouth as a sport fish has prompted a movement toward catch and release fishing

The Reinheitsgebot is a regulation about the purity of beer The regulation started in Ingolstadt in Bavaria in Germany in 1516 

The regulation says several things

Some people talk about the Bavarian Reinheitsgebot or the German Reinheitsgebot They all mean the same thing There are similar acts in the other states which later became known as Germany

The Reinheitsgebot is no longer part of German law It has been replaced by the Provisional German Beer Law which allows things prohibited in the Reinheitsgebot such as wheat malt and cane sugar but which no longer allows unmalted barley

Yeast was not a part of beer until Louis Pasteur discovered what it did during fermentation This was around the year 1800 Brewers usually re used some of the sediments of the fermentation They took some sediments of an older brew and added those sediments to the next brew

Hops were added as a method of preservation  Hops were allowed to stop other things being done to preserve beer Other herbs like stinging nettles had been used The stinging nettle is part of the same plant family as hops

A brewer who broke the Reinheitsgebot was punished The beer barrels were taken by the state and destroyed and heshe did not receive any money for the loss

Even today many brewers are proud of the Reinheitsgebot most German breweries say they follow it Some only use it as a marketing tool The Reinheitsgebot says that beer is made of barley so all wheat beers were not allowed by the original Reinheitsgebot 

Belgian beers are different The brewers often add sugar Nevertheless Belgian beers have a brewing tradition at least as long as those of Germany They taste totally different from the German ones

A Ma or Mass is an old unit of measurement of liquid Literally translated it means mass It is equal to 1069 litre Today it is only used for measuring quantities of beer Beer is usually served as 02 or 03 l or as 05 l but at some occasions and some places it is also served as a Ma

Usually this Ma is served in special mugs These used to be made of ceramics especially clay During the 19th and 20th centuries most were replaced by ones made of glass

The wolverine is a member of the Mustelidae family It is not related to the wolf or the bear as some may think The male is about 18 inches tall the female 14 inches Their length ranges from 36 inches to 45 and they reach a weight of around 25 to 36 pounds Their tail measures about 8 inches Their brown fur protects them from the extremely cold temperatures and their big feet enable them to walk on top of snow

Wolverines can be found in the Northern United States in Canada Alaska Siberia Russia and also in Northern Europe Michigan is known as the Wolverine State but wolverines were not observed there in the wild since the 1800s until 2004 when a female was found in the thumb She died in 2010

Wolverines are omnivores They eat berries and nuts as well as small animals and even large game Their main source of food is carrion They often chase a predator away from its prey and take the kill for themselves They are one of the smallest and most powerful predators in the world

Wolverines feed on almost every type of food that they can find mice rats birds bird eggs reindeer and other large prey Wolverines prefer to hunt larger prey in winter when the snow slows down the prey and gives the wolverine an advantage

Wolverines reproduce every two or three years The female gives birth to one to three young in a tunnel called a den deep underneath snowdrifts

The human is the wolverines main enemy The wolverines thick warm fur is used to manufacture the trim of a parkas hood or other winter clothes as the dense guard hairs do not collect frost The Wolverine is highly territorial 

The German battleship Bismarck was one of the most famous warships of World War II It only sailed for one mission Operation Rheinbung before sinking in the Atlantic Ocean Nearly 3500 seamen lost their lives in the battle which lasted around 8 days

The whole ship with all the oil reserves weighed 53165 tonnes It was about m to ftnum250abbrnospellCommonwealthprecision2wikiyes long and m to ftnum36abbrnospellCommonwealthprecision2wikiyes wide 

The ship had eight big guns convert38cmin1abbronlkon cannons called the heavy artillery There were 12 smaller convert15cmin1abbronlkon cannons and several anti aircraft FLAK cannons too

First the Bismarck had to reach the open sea This because it was a huge battleship few other ships would be able to get close enough to attack without being destroyed so it could control a large area of sea

The first problem the Bismarck had was how to pass the British Isles It took the way near the Fjords of Norway There it met the other German ship Prinz Eugen Both ships reached the open sea in the Denmark straits The Royal Navys battleships HMS Hood and HMS Prince of Wales were sent to sink the Bismarck The Hood lost this battle The Hood was more than a ship for the British military leaders It was kind of a myth So the British Navy sent a large number of ships to hunt the Bismarck There were some cruisers many battleships and some aircraft carriers There was a very dramatic hunt because the Bismarck was damaged but escaped from the nearest British ships 

Finally the Bismarck was found by a some aircraft from one of the ships and its rudder and propeller were broken by the torpedoes they carried then the British battleships HMS King George V and HMS Rodney moved down to their shortest range and fired straight into the ships towers one 16 inch shell hit the bridge and killed the captain and the German admiral Now the Bismarck could not move send radio or fight back due to its fire control taking a direct hit and it was already taking on water due to its dual with HMS Hood and the abandon ship order had been given so all the of the British ships except two cruisers to pick the German sailors left the Bismarck But they had to leave lots behind because a U boat had been sent to find and take the Bismarcks log book back to Germany With the risk of the Bismarck being captured her sailors seriously damaged her and she sank at 1039 Over 2000 men went down with her

The Manhattan Project was the program in which the United States tried to make the first nuclear weapons The project went on during World War II and was run by the US Army The head of the project was General Leslie R Groves who also lead the building of the Pentagon The top scientist on the project was Robert Oppenheimer a famous physicist The project cost 2 billion and created many secret cities and bomb making factories such as a laboratory in Los Alamos New Mexico a nuclear reactor in Hanford Washington and a uranium processing plant in Oak Ridge Tennessee The project was a success and the United States created two nuclear bombs which they used against Japan in 1945

The Manhattan Project operated under a blanket of tight security This was to prevent the Axis powers especially Germany to accelerate their own nuclear projects or undertake covert operations against the project The possibility of sabotage was always present At times people suspected sabotage when equipment failed While there were some problems believed to be the result of careless or disgruntled employees there were no confirmed instances of Axis instigated sabotage However on 10 March 1945 a Japanese fire balloon struck a power line and the resulting power surge caused the three reactors at Hanford to be temporarily shut down

Maintaining security was difficult because so many people worked on the project A special Counter Intelligence Corps detachment handled the projects security issues By 1943 it was clear that the Soviet Union was trying to penetrate the project Lieutenant Colonel Boris T Pash the head of the Counter Intelligence Branch of the Western Defense Command investigated suspected Soviet espionage at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley Oppenheimer informed Pash that he had been approached by a fellow professor at Berkeley Haakon Chevalier about passing information to the Soviet Union

The most successful Soviet spy was Klaus Fuchs Fuchs was member of the British Mission who played an important part at Los Alamos The 1950 revelation of Fuchs espionage activities damaged the United States nuclear cooperation with Britain and Canada Subsequently other instances of espionage were uncovered leading to the arrest of Harry Gold David Greenglass and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg Other spies like George Koval remained unknown for decades People will never know the value of the espionage One reason was that the Soviet atomic bomb project was held back by a shortage of uranium ore The consensus is that espionage saved the Soviets one or two years of effort

The Gunpowder Conspiracy of 1605 was a plan to kill King James I of England and VI of Scotland Other names for the plot are The Powder Treason or The Gunpowder Plot A group of Catholics wanted to blow up Houses of Parliament during the State Opening on 5 November 1605 This would have killed the king and most of the Protestant aristocracy

The conspirators also planned to kidnap the royal children and lead a popular revolt in the Midlands

Robert Catesby led the planning of the conspiracy which started in May 1604 The people who helped him were either wealthy Catholics or gentry families who had a lot of influence Catesby may have come up with the plot when he saw that there was little hope that Great Britain would become more tolerant to Roman Catholics under King James I Many Catholics were disappointed about the situation It is more likely though that Catesby simply wanted to give the Catholics in England a chance The plot was intended to be the first step of a rebellion Afterwards James nine year old daughter could be put in as a Catholic head of state 

Other plotters wereThomas Winter Robert Winter John Wright Christopher Wright Robert Keyes Thomas Percy John Grant Ambrose Rokewood Sir Everard Digby Francis Tresham and Thomas Bates The explosives were prepared by Guy Guido Fawkes a man with 10 years military experience Fawkes had fought with the Spanish against the Dutch in the Spanish Netherlands

The main Jesuit in England Father Henry Garnet was said to know the details of the plot Oswald Tesimond a fellow Jesuit had told him Robert Catesby confessed them to Tesimond and gave him the permission to tell Garnet Although he was convicted there has since been some debate over how much Garnet really knew As the details of the plot were known through confession Garnet was not allowed to reveal them to the authorities He did not think it was a good idea Nevertheless the plot went ahead Garnets opposition to it did not save him from being hanged drawn and quartered for treason in 1606 though

In the 17th century the Palace of Westminster was made of many buildings spread over a large area They were grouped around the medieval chambers chapels and halls of the old royal palace This palace housed both Parliament and the various law courts The palace was also easier to access than it is today Merchants lawyers and other people lived and worked on the palace grounds

As a member of the Kings Bodyguard Percy was able to lease rooms next to the House of Lords in May 1604 The plotters original idea was to dig their way under the foundations of the Lords chamber to put the gunpowder there The main idea was to kill James but many other important targets would be present including most of the Protestant nobility and senior bishops of the Church of England Guy Fawkes as John Johnson was put in charge of this building where he posed as Percys servant Catesbys house in Lambeth was used to store the gunpowder with the tools for digging 

However when the Black Plague came back to London in the summer of 1604 and it proved to be particularly severe For this reason the opening of Parliament was changed to 1605 By Christmas Eve the miners had still not reached the buildings of Parliament and just as they restarted work early in 1605 they learned that the opening of Parliament had been further postponed to 3 October The plotters then took the opportunity to row the gunpowder up the Thames from Catesbys house in Lambeth to hide it in their new rented house they had learned that a coal merchant named Ellen Bright had vacated a ground floor undercroft directly beneath the House of Lords chamber Presented with this golden opportunity Percy immediately took pains to secure the lease He created the story that his wife would join him in London and that he would need the extra storage space 

Fawkes assisted in filling the room with gunpowder which was hidden beneath a wood store under the House of Lords building in a cellar leased from John Whynniard By March 1605 they had filled the undercroft underneath the House of Lords with 36 barrels of gunpowder hidden under a store of winter fuel Had all 36 barrels been successfully ignited the explosion could easily have reduced many of the buildings in the Old Palace of Westminster complex to rubble and would have blown out windows in the surrounding area of about a one kilometre radius 

The conspirators left London in May and went to their homes or to different areas of the country because being seen together would arouse suspicion They arranged to meet again in September however the opening of Parliament was again postponed 

The weakest parts of the plot were the arrangements for the subsequent rebellion which would have swept the country and installed a Catholic monarch Due to the requirements for money and arms Sir Francis Tresham was eventually admitted to the plot and it was probably he who betrayed the plot in writing to his brother in law Lord Monteagle An anonymous letter revealed some of the details of the plot it read I advise you to devise some excuse not to attend this parliament for they shall receive a terrible blow and yet shall not see who hurts them

According to the confession made by Fawkes on Tuesday 5 November 1605 he had left Dover around Easter 1605 bound for Calais He then travelled to Saint Omer and on to Brussels where he met with Hugh Owen and Sir William Stanley before making a pilgrimage to Brabant He returned to England at the end of August or early September again by way of Calais

Guy Fawkes was left in charge of executing the plot while the other conspirators fled to Dunchurch in Warwickshire to await news Once Parliament had been destroyed the other conspirators planned to start a revolt in the Midlands

During the preparation several of the conspirators had been concerned about the safety of fellow Catholics who would be present in Parliament on the day of the planned explosion On the evening of Friday 26 October Lord Monteagle received an anonymous letter while at his house in Hoxton

Monteagle had the note read out loud possibly to warn the plotters that the secret was out and promptly handed it over to Robert Cecil 1st Earl of Salisbury the Secretary of State The conspirators learned of the letter the following day but decided to go ahead with their plan especially after Fawkes inspected the undercroft and found that nothing had been touched 

Having been shown the letter the King ordered Sir Thomas Knyvet to conduct a search of the cellars underneath Parliament which he did in the early hours of 5 November Shortly after midnight Fawkes was found leaving the cellar the conspirators had rented and was arrested giving his name as John Johnson Inside the barrels of gunpowder were discovered hidden under piles of firewood and coal Far from denying his intentions during the arrest Fawkes stated that it had been his purpose to destroy the King and the Parliament Nevertheless Fawkes maintained his false identity and continued to insist that he was acting alone Later in the morning before noon he was again interrogated He was questioned on the nature of his accomplices the involvement of Thomas Percy what letters he had received from overseas and whether or not he had spoken with Hugh Owen

A letter written by Gentleman of the Bedchamber Sir Edward Hoby gave details of all those that would have been caught in the explosion On the 5th of November we began a Parliament to which the King should have cometh in person but refrained through a practice but that morning discovered The plot was to have blown up the King at such time as he should have been sat in his royal throne Nobility and Commons and with all Bishops Judges and Doctors at one instant and the blast to have ruined the whole estate and kingdom of England 

Fawkes was taken to the Tower of London and interrogated there under torture Torture was forbidden except by the express instruction of the monarch or a body such as the Privy Council or the Star Chamber In a letter of 6 November King James I stated

The discovery of the Gunpowder Plot aroused a wave of national relief at the delivery of the king and his sons and inspired in the ensuing parliament a mood of loyalty and goodwill which Salisbury astutely exploited to extract higher subsidies for the king than any granted in Elizabeths reign In his speech to both Houses on 9 November James expounded on two emerging preoccupations of his monarchy the Divine Right of Kings and the Catholic question He insisted that the plot had been the work of only a few Catholics not of the English Catholics as a whole and he reminded the assembly to rejoice at his survival since kings were divinely appointed and he owed his escape to a miracle

John Knox was the man who brought the Protestant Reformation to Scotland He was one of the founders of the Presbyterian Church Knox joined the movement to change the Roman Catholic church in Scotland He married twice and had five children and continued preaching until he died

A long time fight between Catholic France and Protestant England for Scotland began again because of the Reformation As the argument grew more heated sometimes France had power sometimes England Knox spent many months as a galley slave he also spent time in exile because of his Protestant beliefs During a return visit to his native land Knoxs preaching helped the Protestant movement Several Protestant noblemen came together and made a group called the Lords of the Congregation When the group had more power they invited Knox back to Scotland to stay

During 1500 and 1561 the Scottish Parliament accepted the Reformed confession of faith made by Knox and other people Knox argued many times with Mary Queen of Scots In his book History of the Reformation in Scotland he writes about his five conversations with the Roman Catholic queen In one of these conversations Mary asked Knox what right he had to broken wikt linkrebukerebuke the queen so directly and openly Knox replied I am a worm of this earth and yet a subjectbut I am a watchman both over the realm and the Kirk Church of GodFor that reason I am bound in conscience to blow the trumpet publicly Marys violent life finally made even her Catholic helpers lose their support She gave up the throne So Knox was able to make the Protestant church in Scotland Because of him the Presbyterian church was made

The Great Schism is a word that is used to describe how Christianity developed into two big branches named after Sydney Lynn Hartman in the Middle Ages The Western part later became the Roman Catholic Church The Eastern part is known as the Eastern Orthodox Church During the centuries views on politics and theology developed differently in several ways

During the 5th and 6th Centuries the East and West became isolated from each other due to the invasions of the Balkan peninsula They also had different languages Latin was the most important language in the West The East mainly spoke the Greek language Because of this talking to each other was difficult  The West came under Frankish influence in the 700s  

There were many bishops in the church and in the East the Pope was considered the first among equals but Rome claimed that the Pope was the only remaining Apostolic see At first the Eastern Orthodox did not mind the Popes claim for power over the West  as long as his power stayed in the West But it came to pass that the Pope decided he also had power over Eastern Christendom as well and he tried to enforce his power on the eastern Patriarchates A letter written in 865 by Pope Nicholas claims the Popes power extends over all the earth that is over every church Pope Nicholas also went beyond his powers as stated in Canon 111 of the Council of Sardica when he overturned a verdict and ordered a retrial on a matter concerning Photius and St Ignatius two Patriarchs of Constantinople This was as a result of petitions to Rome by backers of Ignatius However it should be noted that not all the Popes after Nicholas were as extreme  that is until Pope Leo IX When in 1053 Cerularius attempted friendly relations with Pope Leo IX after a disagreement a bull of excommunication was brought to Constantinople Each Church excommunicated the other

These were just some of the issues plaguing the Eastern and Western Christians that led to the Great Schism It seems that even after 1054 relations between the east and west were not completely unfriendly and the common peasant was probably not immediately affected by the schism

A logical fallacy or simply a fallacy is some logical transition that people think can be done but that really cannot be done It is like an error in thinking Aristotle and other philosophers identified several such kinds of fallacies

The list is based on the Organon by Aristotle and is widely accepted in scientific literature The terms used are those commonly used in English

The Republic of the Union of Myanmar is the largest country in South East Asia that is not an island partly considered as South Asian It is bordered by China on the north Laos on the east Thailand on the southeast Bangladesh on the west and the India on the northwest with the Andaman Sea to the south and the Bay of Bengal to the southwest There are over 2000 kilometers of coast line The country was ruled by a military junta led by General Ne Win from 1962 to 1988 and its political system today stays under the tight control of its military government Since 1992 Myanmar has been ruled by Senior General Than Shwe

In 1989 the military junta officially changed the English version of its name from Burma to Myanmar It also made a new name in English for places in the country such as its former capital city from Rangoon to Yangon The official name of the country in the Burmese language Myanma did not change however The renaming was controversial seen by some as linguistically bad Accepting the name change in the English speaking world has been slow with many people still using the name Burma to refer to the country Major news organizations like the BBC still call it Burma Some question the military juntas authority to officially change the name in English in the first place Aung San Suu Kyi however calls the country Myanmar now

Myanmar had a strong kingdom in ancient times but the nation was taken over by the British in the 1800s Myanmar became independent in 1948 as the Union of Burma and had a democratic government at first However in 1962 a coup dtat brought the military into power where it has been ever since The founder of modern Myanmar Aung San was assassinated months before independence His daughter Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest many times for leading the democracy movement

In 1991 the military junta agreed to democratic elections which were won by the National League for Democracy and should have made Aung San Suu Kyi the Prime Minister However the dictatorship ignored the results of the elections and continued ruling In November 2005 the military government stated that the national capital would be moved from Yangon to a location near Pyinmana which was renamed Naypyidaw in March 2006

Today there are 14 sections 7 are called states and the other 7 are called divisions

The Amazon Rainforest is the forest that grows in the tropical basin of the Amazon River

The forest lies in a basin drained largely by the Amazon River with 1100 tributaries It is a moist broadleaf forest that covers seven million square kilometers of which five and a half million square kilometers are covered by the rainforest 

This region includes territory belonging to nine nations The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil with 60 of the rainforest followed by Peru with 13 and with minor amounts in Colombia Venezuela Ecuador Bolivia Guyana Suriname and French Guiana 

The Amazon represents over half of the planets remaining rainforests and it comprises the largest and most species rich tract of tropical rainforest in the world

The forest was formed at least 55 million years ago in the Eocene period

Wet tropical forests are the most species rich biome and tropical forests in the Americas have more species African and Asian wet forestsmnTurner1 As the largest area of tropical rainforest in the Americas Amazonian rainforests have more biodiversity than anywhere else in the Americas

The region is home to 25 million insect species tens of thousands of species of plants and some 2000 species of birds and mammals The diversity of plant species is the highest on earth with some experts estimating that one square kilometre may contain over 75000 types of trees and 150000 species of higher plants One square kilometre of Amazon rainforest can have about 90000 tons of living plants This is the largest collection of living plants and animal species in the world One in five of all the birds in the world live in the rainforests of the Amazon To date an estimated 438000 species of plants of economic and social interest have been registered in the region with many more remaining to be discovered or cataloged

More than one fifth of the Amazon Rainforest has already been destroyed The forest which remains is threatened People who care for the environment warn about the loss of biodiversity They also point out that releasing the carbon which is stored in the trees will increase global warming

Some people have calculated that it may even pay to save the forest They said that one hectare of Amazonian forest in Peru is worth about US 6280 if it is used to harvest fruits latex and timber If all the wood is cut down for timber it has a value of about US 1000 Obviously this can only be done once it is not sustainable When the forest has been cleared the hectar of land can be used as a pasture and is worth about US 148Not all people agree on the study some have questioned the assumptions behind it 

The Fora Area Brasileira has been using EMBRAER R 99 surveillance aircraft to monitor the forest This was done as part of the SIVAM program At a conference in July 2004 scientists warned that the rainforest will no longer be able to absorb the millions of tons of greenhouse gases annually as it usually does because of the increased speed of rainforest destruction

9169 square miles of rain forest were cut down in 2003 alone In Brazil alone European colonists have destroyed more than 90 indigenous tribes since the 1900s With them have gone centuries of knowledge of the medicinal value of rainforest species As their homelands continue to be destroyed by deforestation rainforest peoples are also disappearing

Once the process of vulcanization was invented companies began to make many kinds of new rubber products such as boots and seals for machines American and European companies began buying large amounts of latex from Brazil This boom in Brazilian rubber began around 1870 but it was the need for automobile tires that brought the greatest wealth to the new rubber producers

Other rain forest had rubber trees but in Amazonia were by far the best However the trees could not be planted on farms or plantations because if they were next to each other the insects would eat them Therefore people had to find the trees in the rain forest cut slits in them leave cups to collect the latex and come back later to get it Thousands of people moved to the rain forest to work collecting rubber Most of these people were hired by wealthy rubber merchants The rubber merchants loaned them money to come down the river and buy tools Each rubber merchants collectors were forced to sell the rubber only to their rubber merchant at low prices and buy supplies only from them at high prices That meant the collectors were always in debt to their merchant and could not leave to do something else The rubber merchants quickly became very rich The center of the rubber trade was the city Manaus on the Rio Negro It became first a boom town and then a beautiful wealthy city It had electricity before most of the cities in the United States did The newly rich merchants built huge expensive homes and brought in new automobiles to travel on the citys few roads They built a magnificent opera house with crystal chandeliers and decorated tiles brought all the way from Europe

However the rubber boom only lasted about forty years ending by 1913 Some men had taken the seeds of the Amazon rubber trees and began growing them in the Asian rain forests The trees grew well there and they could be grown on plantations The insects that could destroy them were in South America So the price of rubber began to fall and the rubber boom stopped

Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin was a Russian cosmonaut He became the first human in space on April 12 1961 in a rocket launched by the Soviet Union

Yuri Gagarin was born in the village of Klushino near Gzhatsk on 9 March 1934 The town next to Gzhatsk was renamed Gagarin in 1968 in his honour His parents Alexey Ivanovich Gagarin and Anna Timofeyevna Gagarina worked on a collective farm While manual workers are thought as peasants this may be too simple if applied to his parents his mother was said to love reading and his father was a skilled carpenter Yuri was the third of four children and his elder sister helped raise him while his parents worked Like millions of people in the Soviet Union the Gagarin family suffered during the Nazi invasion in World War II His two elder siblings were sent out to Nazi Germany for slave work in 1943 and did not return until after the war While a youth Yuri became interested in space and planets and began to dream about his space tour which would one day become a reality Yuri was thought by his teachers as smart and hard working sometimes broken wikt linkmischievousmischievous His mathematics and science teacher had flown in the Soviet Air Forces during the war which was said to make some impression on young Gagarin

After starting an apprenticeship in a metalworks as a foundryman Gagarin was selected for further training at a technical high school in Saratov While there he joined the AeroClub and learned to fly a light aircraft In 1955 after finishing his technical schooling he entered military flight training at the Orenburg Pilots School While there he met Valentina Goryacheva Yuri married her in 1957 after gaining his pilots wings in a MiG 15 Post graduation he was told to go to Luostari airbase in Murmansk Oblast close to the Norwegian border where bad weather made flying risky As a full grown man Gagarin was convert157mftin tall which was an advantage in the small Vostok cockpit He became Lieutenant of the Soviet Air Force on 5 November 1957 and on 6 November 1959 he got the rank of Senior Lieutenant

Gagarin kept physically fit throughout his life and was a good sportsman As the space explorer Valery Bykovsky wrote

As well as being a good ice hockey player Gagarin was also a basketball fan and coached the Saratov Industrial Technical School team as well as being an umpirereferee

In 1960 after the search and selection process Yuri Gagarin was selected with 19 other space explorers for the Soviet space program Along with the other soon to be space explorers he was tested by experiments made to test his physical and psychological score he also underwent training for the upcoming flight Out of the twenty selected the choices for the first launch were Gagarin and Gherman Titov because of their performance in training as well as their physical well being

On 12 April 1961 Gagarin became the first man to travel into space launching to orbit aboard the Vostok 3KA 3 His call sign in this flight was Kedr During his flight Gagarin famously whistled the song The Motherland Hears The Motherland Knows The first two lines of the song are The Motherland hears the Motherland knowsWhere her son flies in the sky This song was written by Dmitri Shostakovich in 1951 with words by Yevgeniy Dolmatovsky

Around the same time some Western people claimed that Gagarin during his space flight had made the comment I dont see any God up here However no such words appear in the direct record of Gagarins talk with the Earth during the spaceflight In a 2006 interview a close friend of Gagarin Colonel Valentin Petrov said that Gagarin never said such words and that the phrase came from Nikita Khrushchevs speech at the fullness of the Central Committee of the CPSU where the anti religious propaganda was talked about In a certain context Khrushchev said Gagarin flew into space but didnt see any God there

After the flight Gagarin became a world famous celebrity He toured in many places like in Italy the United Kingdom Germany Canada and Japan He did this to promote the Soviet broken wikt linkachievementachievement

In 1962 he began serving as a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union He later came back to Star City While there he worked on designs for a broken wikt linkreusablereusable spacecraft Gagarin worked on these designs in Star City for seven years He became Lieutenant Colonel of the Soviet Air Force on 12 June 1962 Then on 6 November 1963 he got the rank of Colonel of the Soviet Air Force Soviet people tried to keep him away from any flights being worried of losing their hero in an accident Gagarin was backup pilot for Vladimir Komarov in the Soyuz 1 flight As Komarovs flight ended in a deadly crash Gagarin was banned from training for and helping out in further spaceflights

Gagarin then became deputy training director of the Star City cosmonaut training base At the same time he began to re join as a fighter pilot On 27 March 1968 while on a broken wikt linkroutineroutine training flight from Chkalovsky Air Base he and flight instructor Vladimir Seryogin died in a MiG 15UTI crash near the town of Kirzhach Gagarin and Seryogin were buried in the walls of the Kremlin on Red Square

People are not sure what caused the crash but a 1986 inquest thinks that the turbulence from a Su 11 Fishpot C broken wikt linkinterceptorinterceptor using its afterburners may have caused Gagarins plane to go out of control

Russian documents opened to the public in March 2003 showed that the KGB had changed their own investigation of the accident In addition to this one government and two military investigations The KGBs report removed many conspiracy thoughts instead of showing the actions of air base personnel added to the crash The report says that an air traffic controller made Gagarin have old weather information But by that time of his flight conditions had become very bad Ground crew also left fuel tanks on the aircraft Gagarins planned flight needed good weather and no outboard tanks The investigation ended saying that Gagarins aircraft entered a spin either because of a bird strike or because of a sudden move to avoid another aircraft Because of the lod weather report the crew thought their altitude to be higher than it actually was and could not properly react to bring the MiG 15 out of its spin

In his 2004 book Two Sides of the Moon Alexey Leonov tells that he was flying a helicopter in the same area that day when he heard two loud booms in the distance Approving other broken wikt linktheorietheories his thoughts are that a Sukhoi jet was flying below its minimum allowed altitude and without realizing it because of the terrible weather conditions he passed within 10 or 20 meters of Yuri and Seregins plane while breaking the sound barrier The resulting turbulence would have sent the MiG into an uncontrolled spin Leonov thinks the first boom he heard was that of the jet breaking the sound barrier and the second was Gagarins plane crashing

A goalkeeper is someone who protects a teams goal There are goalkeepers in sports like football and ice hockey for example The goalkeepers mission is to prevent the opposing team from scoring a goal Goalkeepers normally wear more protective gear than other players on the team but this is not always true

A goalkeepers kit consists of shin guards and gloves to protect his hands from the impact of the ball when he catches it

Historically however until the 1970s goalkeepers would wear little or no hand protection 

Until the early 20th century the goalkeeper would often wear the same coloured strip as his teammates with the only different item of clothing being his cap However in 1909 the Scottish Football Association took steps to ensure the goalkeeper would wear a different colour from the outfield players This was to show his different role as the only player allowed to handle the ball

The goalkeeper in ice hockey uses thicker padding than the other players on the team This is to prevent damage caused by being hit by the puck The hockey stick of the goalie is much wider than the stick of other players The bottom edge is also longer and flatter The goalie has a very large leather glove on one hand This glove has a large area to help catch the puck Goalies normally wear masks that give protection to the entire face and head as well as the neck

Klauea one of the worlds most active volcanoes and Mauna Loa the most massive offer scientists insights on the birth of the Hawaiian Islands and give visitors views of dramatic volcanic landscapes

In recognition of its outstanding natural values Hawaiokinai Volcanoes National Park has been designated as an International Biosphere Reserve in 1980 and a World Heritage Site in 1987

On March 19 2008 there was a small explosion in Halemaokinaumaokinau crater the first explosive event since 1924 and the first eruption in the Klauea caldera since September 1982 

Debris from the explosion was scattered over an area of convert74acrem2 A small amount of ash was also reported at a nearby community The explosion covered part of Crater Rim Drive and damaged Halemaokinaumaokinau overlook The explosion did not release any lava which suggests to scientists that it was driven by hydrothermal or gas sources

This explosion event followed the opening of a major sulfur dioxide gas vent greatly increasing levels emitted from the Halemaokinaumaokinau crater

A yawn is a reflex It involves a large long taking in of air the stretching of eardrums as the jaw opens wide and last a breathing out Pandiculation is the act of yawning and stretching simultaneously

Yawning is commonly associated with tiredness stress overwork lack of stimulation and boredom In humans yawning is often triggered by others yawning and is a typical example of positive feedback This infectious yawning has also been observed in chimpanzees and dogs Cats both yawn and stretch though not necessarily at the same time

The yawn reflex has long been observed to be contagious In 1508 Erasmus wrote One mans yawning makes another yawn and the French proverbialized the idea to Un bon billeur en fait billier deux Often if one person yawns this may cause another person to empathetically yawn Observing another persons yawning face even reading or thinking about yawning or looking at a yawning picture can cause a person to yawn 

The immediate cause for contagious yawning may be the mirror neurons in the frontal cortex of certain vertebrates which upon being exposed to a stimulus activates the same regions in the brain Mirror neurons have been proposed as a driving force for imitation which lies at the root of much human learning such as language acquisition Yawning may be an offshoot of the same imitative impulse

Charles Darwin argued in The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals that if a behaviour was present in many cultures then it must be inherited All traits which appear in a wide range of animals must have some function which is supported by natural selection In most cases the function is obvious but with yawning we do not know what that function is Suggestions have been made but they do not seem to account for its widespread occurrence in vertebrates

A helicopter is a kind of flying machine or aircraft A helicopter lifts up off of the ground and moves because of its rotors A rotor is several small wings called rotor blades that spin together around a shaft For that reason helicopters are sometimes called rotary wing aircraft A helicopter flies differently from an airplane An airplane must move forward to stay in the air but because the helicopters rotor blades are always moving the helicopter can stop and stay in one place above the ground This allows them to land in places where an airplane cannot Helicopters can move by tilting their rotors which causes the rotor blades to fly in the direction the rotor is tilted

Since around 400 BC the Chinese had a flying top that was used as a childrens toy The flying top was made from bamboo and used the same method of spinning wings to fly up in the air Later flying tops were made of feathers tied to a stick Leonardo da Vinci first thought of a helicopter flown by a man in 1490 and drew pictures of his ideas It was hundreds of years later before anyone built one that could really fly The first man to fly a helicopter was a Frenchman Paul Cornu Then a Russian immigrant to America Igor Sikorsky built and perfected the first practical helicopter

Helicopters are especially useful when there are floods and other disasters Food packets water medicines and clothes are dropped from the air to people on the ground who cannot be reached by road When people are injured helicopters can carry them to hospitals faster than an ambulance on the road Helicopters are also used by the military because they can move troops and equipment to places an airplane cannot take them Guns can be mounted on them and missiles can be shot from them

The Congress decides whether FIFA should accept new national associations and elects the President of FIFA its General Secretary and the other members of FIFAs Executive Committee The President and General Secretary take care of what goes on within and around FIFA The Executive Committee with the President as its head is responsible for deciding the dates locations and format of tournaments

Also there are six regional confederations recognized by FIFA which take care of the game in the six different continents of the world National associations must be members of both FIFA and their regional confederation in order for their teams to compete in FIFAs competitions The six confederations are AFC CAF CONCACAF CONMEBOL OFC and UEFA

American Idol is a popular TV show in America that lets anyone sing to people watching the show on television while they are being judged It is based on the British show Pop Idol The TV show consists of multiple rounds of elimination Eventually the American people are allowed to vote by calling or texting and the person with the least votes is off the show The singers can be anyone between the age of 16 and 28 years In 2011 the show finished the tenth season

American Idol has three judges who give comments on performances The three judges are 

American Idol also has a host Ryan Seacrest

A smile is a face made by flexing the muscles near both ends of the mouth The smile can also be made through the eyes Smiles usually show happiness A smile can be natural or fake However smiling can be different with animals When smiling the teeth shows but sometimes animals do this when they are threatening When chimpanzees show their teeth it can also be a sign of fear

Dimples are genetically inherited They are caused by the flesh underneath the skin that forms on some peoples cheeks especially when they smile Some people may only have one dimple on only one side of the face

Although there are many different types of smiles researchers are interested in the duchenne smile because it is done with the eyes The Duchenne smile was named after the French physician Guillaume Duchenne Duchenne identified two types of smiles A Duchenne smile is when the cheek raises and forms a wrinkle around the eyes Many researchers think that Duchenne smiles are usually hard to make when you are pretending to smile

On the Internet smiles can normally be typed up This is normally called a smiley smiley face or happy face Smileys show emotion when people are not able to see it in real life Smileys typed on the computer are called emoticons Smileys can change depending on where the person typing the smiley is

The Emperor of Ethiopa was the name of the ruler of Ethiopia until 1975 when the emperors and the royal family the Solomonids were taken out of power 

The name that was used for Emperor by the Ethiopians means King of Kings

The Solomonid dynasty was a line of emperors that ruled in Ethiopia from 1270 to 1975 There were some other emperors that ruled who were not from the Solomonid dynasty but the Solomonids were in control most of the time 

The emperors did not use their real name when they became Emperor of Ethiopia but they made up a new one for their rule For example the first Emperor of the Solomonids was Yekuno Amlak But he used the name Tasfa Iyassus after he became ruler 

The dynasty began in 1270 when Yekuno Amlak killed the last king of the Zagwe dynasty which had ruled Ethiopia Yekuno Amlak was made king and European historians say was the first ruler of the dynasty But most Ethiopian books say that Menelik I the son of King Solomon of Israel and the Queen of Sheba was the first Emperor of this dynasty

The leaders of Ethiopa from 1270 to 1975

The Sound of Music is a 1959 Broadway West End musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein and a 1965 movie from 20th Century Fox Both are loosely based on the lives of the von Trapp family

In the movie Julie Andrews plays a nun in Salzburg Austria She is sent from her convent to the home of Captain von Trapp whose wife has died to be the governess of his seven children Mischievous at first von Trapps children come to like Maria and Maria falls in love with their father Maria teaches the children how to sing and have fun because after their mother died Captain von Trapp almost completely erased all forms of fun Instead of choosing baroness Shroeder as his new wife he ends up marrying Maria

After all of this takes place the Nazis take over Austria and wanted Captain von Trapp to join them But in an attempt to escape the Captain and his family leave the house late one evening and while pushing their car out of the drive they are caught by the head of the army in the area After being caught Maria and Captain come up with a crafty lie to save themselves They told them that their car broke down and that the family was supposed to be performing at the Salzburg Festival Then they get to the festival and perform Their dear Uncle Max helps them to escape while the army is entertained

The family escapes to the Alps and eventually walks over them into the next country to live

This movie is based on a true story but not all of the movie is true One make believe scene is that the family is seen walking over the Alps into the next town In real life the family would not do that because they would have been walking right into Hitlers home area

Also in real life after the von Trapp family left their house Adolf Hitler used it as a headquarters later on

At the time that it came out The Sound of Music made the most money of any movie That may still be true

There is a 40th Anniversary Edition of this movie available on DVD with special features like interviews with Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer and an entire cast reunion of all 7 children

The Academy Award for Best Picture is one of the Academy Awards Also called Oscars the Academy Awards are given to people working in the film industry by the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences The name of the award has changed over time It was first Best Production in 1927 They also gave out Best Picture Unique and Artistic Production also known as Best Artistic Quality of Production in 1927 the Best Picture Unique and Artistic Production award was only given out the first year In 1930 the name was changed to Best Picture It is still called that today

In the list below are the winners of the award for each year A list of the winners and other nominees is in the main article for each decade

Bulimia nervosa is a disease and a type of eating disorder It is when a person wants to starve his or her self People who have it feel that they are fat and want to be skinny When they are hungry they eat a lot of food Then they try to take it back by vomiting exercising or using drugs

The person with bulimia eats large amounts of food Then they want to get rid of it To do this they vomit or use drugs They do this at least two times a week or more often The person always thinks about how his or her body looks and he or she wants to be skinny The person may also have anorexia nervosa However some people with bulimia have a normal weight or are overweight which makes it difficult to know when someone has bulimia

Bulimia nervosa can cause many health problems Because vomit has a lot of acid in it doing it a lot can burn the persons mouth throat or teeth Someone can lose nutrients or fluids in his or her body Glands in ones throat and face may get bigger and hurt The immune system is weakened and a person can get muscle or heart problems Sometimes bulimia can cause difficulty breathing This is because the acids that are in your mouth go to your lungs and damages the bronchioles

Most people who get bulimia are ages 10 to 25 Usually girls have bulimia but boys can have it too People who have had bad things happen to them are more likely to get the disease too People with obsessive compulsive disorder or perfectionism are also more likely to have bulimia

The Turks and Caicos Islands are two groups of islands that are owned by the British They are in the Caribbean Sea near the Bahamas Fishing is the biggest part of the economy 

The ruler of Great Britain is also the ruler of the Turks and Caicos but that ruler always acts through a governor There are no elections for president and all the officers of government are named by the ruler or monarch

This is the main island where all the government offices are held Grand Turk is the capital of the Turks and Caicos Islands It has its own International Airport

Often shortened to just Provo this island has its own International Airport and is host to a large number of holiday resorts including Sandals Beaches resort A large coral reef is situated to the north of the island To the east of the island a new development named Leewood is being built

There are few beaches on West Cay The main income is salt processing It does not have an airport

The population of Turks and Caicos Islands is nearly 22000 The ethnic make up of the population is 

Anguilla was once part of what is now Saint Kitts and Nevis but broke away in 1980 Anguilla wanted to still be a part of Great Britain and Saint Kitts and Nevis wanted to be independent

It is named after the Spanish word for eel because it has such a shape

The queen of the United Kingdom is the ruler of Anguilla but she works through a governor She names or appoints the governor and he is just working there in her place The legislature is elected by the people has 11 members and is called the House of Assembly

Anguilla gets most of its money from fishing and tourism

Most people in Anguilla are Protestants and speak English

Bermuda is a British overseas territory in the North Atlantic Ocean The land has one main island and 180 smaller islands Bermuda is a popular tourist place with mild weather during the winter months

Located off the east coast of the United States Bermudas nearest landmass is Cape Hatteras North Carolina about 1030 kilometres to the west northwest It is about 1373 kilometres south of Halifax Nova Scotia Canada and 1770 kilometres northeast of Miami Florida Its capital city is Hamilton

Bermuda has a wealthy economy with finance as its largest sector followed by tourism In 2005 Bermuda was even claimed to have the worlds highest GDP per capita yet these statistics are hard to verify as Bermuda is not classified as a country but rather as a territory of the UK

Bermuda has a subtropical climate The weather is humid and as a result the summertime heat index can be high even though mid August temperatures rarely exceed 30 C Winters are mild with average daytime temperatures in January and February around 20 C The temperature rarely drops below 10 C

Bermuda is the easternmost point of the so called Bermuda Triangle a region of sea in which a number of aircraft and ships have allegedly disappeared under mysterious circumstances Some people think there is a pattern to the disappearances while other people think it is only coincidence

A tailor is a person whose job is to make clothes to fit people A tailor might make a new piece of clothing or change an item so that it fits better They also mend clothes A tailor is also called a seamster or a seamstress for a woman

A template is a tool that shows the shape of something or it is a tool to help make something It can separate the form of something from the things inside it

In drawing a template can be a wood plastic or metal tool that is used to help make marks with a pen or pencil Lines can be drawn on paper or on metal or wood to make the same shape many times

In publishing for example a template is a broken wikt linklayoutlayout made by someone else to give an idea what to write in different parts of a book or story A simple publishing template can have spaces for the words for pictures for the story title and for the name of the publication

Humans or machines can use templates Some computer programs that work with the Internet use a template to separate the way the program works from the way it shows the words and pictures It can be a way to copy words and pictures In computer programming templates save time because the programmer does not need to write the same words over and over

When doctors plan to give a person a new bone joint made of metal or plastic they can use a template in the shape of the new joint This type of template is put on an x ray picture of the person to help to decide the size of joint needed

Gliders are aircraft which do not have a motor Glider can also describe an animal which flies without flapping or beating wings Animal gliders use passive flaps to glide from higher to lower points usually in a forest

Mechanical gliders are sometimes called sailplanes Gliders are controlled by their pilots by using control sticks Some gliders can only carry one person but some gliders can carry two people In gliders with two seats each pilot has a control stick Gliders always have seats for the pilots

Gliders have long wings so that they will only lose height slowly In some places the air goes up faster than the glider is going down The pilot of a glider can make it climb by flying to these places Good pilots can travel long distances by always finding rising air Some pilots race each other over hundreds of kilometres each day Other pilots just fly for fun

Gliders cannot get into the air by themselves They are pulled into the air by an aircraft with a motor or they are pulled up by motor on the ground

There are two other types of gliders Hang gliders have frames to give the wings their shape but do not have seats for their pilots and do not have control sticks The wings of paragliders are like parachutes and so do not have frames to give them their shape These other two types of glider are often launched from the tops of hills or cliffs

John Stuart Mill was an English philosopher and political economist He was a classical liberal thinker of the 19th century He was for utilitarianism the ethical theory first proposed by his godfather Jeremy Bentham

Jeremy Bentham was an English jurist philosopher and legal and social reformer He is best known as one of the first people for utilitarianism and animal rights and gay rights 

Bentham was one of the most influential liberals partially through his writings but particularly through his students all around the world including John Stuart Mill and several political leaders He is believed to be the innovator of classical liberalism a term first coined in the 19th century After he died his body was preserved

A lucid dream is a dream where the person knows that they are dreaming The person can then try to control things in the dream because it is not real In a lucid dream it is possible to do anything the dreamer wants such as flying

Some people have lucid dreams for spiritual reasons but they can also be used for fun or to stop bad dreams

Although some people can have lucid dreams without trying most people do not have them often It is important to be able to remember dreams because if the dreamer does not remember them he or she will not know if they were lucid dreams or not Remembering dreams becomes easier if they are written in a dream diary upon waking up 

There are some ways that help make lucid dreams more likely Stephen LaBerge a psychologist who studies lucid dreams made the MILD technique To do this the dreamer must wake up after having a dream and visualise himself or herself being in the dream again except now knowing it is a dream The dreamer should think the next time I am dreaming I want to remember I am dreaming and should concentrate on this while returning to sleep There are many other ways to help someone lucid dream One other way is to fall asleep while keeping the mind awake This is called the WILD technique It is easiest to perform after waking up from a few hours of sleep

A composite number is a natural number that can be found by multiplying prime numbers

For example the number 9 can be found by multiplying 3 by 3 and the number 12 You get it by multiplying 3 2 and 2

All natural numbers can be put in one of the two classes below

The Fundamental theorem of arithmethic is a theorem of number theory The theorem says that every positive integer greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime numbers The theorem also says that there is only one way to write the number If two people found two different ways to write the number the only thing that can be different is the order in which the primes are written For example we can write

and if somebody else finds another way to write 6936 or 1200 as product of prime numbers we can put those prime numbers in the right order and find out that it is the same as what we have here Finding the prime numbers is called factorization 

This theorem can be used in cryptography

The first person who proved the theorem was Euclid The first detailed and correct proof was in the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae by Carl Friedrich Gau 

Some people may think that the theorem is true everywhere However the theorem is not true in more general number systems like algebraic integers This was first mentioned by Ernst Kummer in 1843 in his work on Fermats last theorem For more information about that read algebraic number theory 

The proof consists of two parts first we show that every number can be written as a product of primes second we show that if we write a number as a product of primes for a second time then the two lists of prime numbers must be the same 

We show that if not every number greater than 1 can be written as a product of primes we end up in some kind of impossibility So after that we conclude that it must be true that every number can be written as a product of primes 

So now see what happens when somebody says that he knows a positive integer greater than 1 which can not be written as a product of primes In that case we ask him to mention all the numbers greater than 1 that can not be written as a product of primes One of these numbers must be the smallest lets call it n Of course this number n cannot be 1 Further it cannot be a prime number because a prime number is a product of a single prime itself So it must be a product of numbers Thus 

where both a and b are positive integers that are of course smaller than n But n was the smallest number that can not be written as a product of primes So it must be possible to write a and b as products of primes because they are both smaller than n But then the product 

can be written as a product of primes as well This is an impossibility because we said that n can not be written as a product of primes 

We have now shown the impossibility which exists if the first part of the theorem would not be true In this way we have now proven the first part of the theorem 

Now we have to prove that there is only one way to write a positive number greater than 1 as a product of prime numbers 

To do this we use the following lemma if a prime number p divides a product ab then it divides a or it divides b First we now prove this lemma Well assume now that p does not divide a Then p and a are coprime and we have Bzouts identity that says that there must be integers x and y such that 

Multiplying everything with b gives 

On the left hand side we have now two terms that are divisible by p So the term on the right hand side is also divisible by p We have now proven that if p does not divide a it must divide b That proves the lemma 

Now we will prove that we can write an integer greater than 1 in only one way as a product of prime numbers Take two products of primes A and B which have the same outcome So we know for the outcome of the products that A B Take any prime p from the first product A It divides the A so it also divides B Using several times the lemma that we just proved we can see that p must then divide at least one factor b of B But the factors are all primes themselves so also b is prime But we know that p is also prime so p must be equal to b So now we divide A by p and also divide B by p And we get a result like A B Again we can take a prime p from the first product A and find out that is equal to some number in the product B Continuing in this way at the end we see that the prime factors of the two products must be exactly the same This proves that we can write a positive integer as a product of primes in only one unique way

Welding is a way of heating pieces of metal using electricity or a flame so that they melt and stick together There are many kinds of welding including arc welding resistance welding and gas welding The most common type is arc welding Anyone who is near arc welding needs to wear a special helmet or goggles because the arc is so bright Looking at the arc will hurt your eyes maybe forever It is also important to cover all your skin because it can give you something like a sunburn Hot sparks from the weld can burn any skin that is showing One kind of welding that does not use an arc is Oxy fuel welding sometimes called gas welding OFW uses a flame to heat up the metal There are other kinds of welding that do not use an arc

Any welding process that utilizes an electrical arc is known as arc welding The common forms of arc welding include 

Shielded metal arc welding SMAW is also known as stick welding

Gas metal arc welding GMAW is also known as MIG

Gas tungsten arc welding GTAW is also known as TIG

Arc welding heats metals by making a high current electric arc between pieces of metal to be joined and an electrode

Use of the electrode varies based on the type of welding process In SMAW GMAW and related welding processes the electrode is consumed and becomes part of the weld The electrode is usually made of the same kind of metal to be welded Because the electrode is consumed by the welding process the electrode must constantly be fed into the weld The SMAW welding process features a stick electrode impregnated with a weld promoter known as flux clamped to the end

The GMAW welding process features a continuous electrode as a thin wire on a rotating spool The size of this electrode varies from around 0635 millimeters to about 4 millimeters The welding machine has a motor driven spool inside that feeds the wire electrode into the weld

The TIG welding process features an electrode that is not consumed by the welding process as the metal that makes up the weld does not have any electricity flowing through it The electrode is made of Tungsten so used as it will not melt while immersed in the electrical arc A filler metal in the form of a rod can be used to add metal to the weld area

Almost all welding uses filler metal to fill in the small gap between the metal The extra metal helps to make the weld strong Sometimes welds need to be made without any filler metal Welding with no filler metal is called autogenous welding

All types of welding require that the hot metal have protection Dirt rust grease and even the oxidation of the metal under the weld process can prevent a proper weld joint As such all weld processes use one of two protection methods flux and shielding gas

Welding flux may be used in a solid liquid or paste form During welding the flux will melt and some of it will evaporate This creates a small pocket of gas around the weld This pocket of gas prevents oxidation of the metal under weld Melted flux through a corrosive reaction cleans contaminants that prevent a proper weld After welding the flux solidifies This layer of solid flux is called slag and must be removed from the weld The SMAW weld process most commonly uses flux and is most commonly used on steel

Shielding gas protects the weld by being a pocket of gas around the weld The purpose of this gas is to keep normal air out especially oxygen It is different from flux because there is no liquid on the weld There is only a gas around the weld Because there is no liquid it will not clean up dirt and other things on the metal This means that the metal has to be clean before it is welded If it is not the dirt and other things could cause problems The gases that are usually used are argon helium and a mixture that is 3 parts argon and one part carbon dioxide Other mixtures of gases can have nitrogen hydrogen or even a little bit of oxygen in them One kind of welding that uses shielding gas is gas metal arc welding It is usually used in factories to make things

Welding that uses flux is easier to do outside when it is windy This is because the liquid flux is protecting the hot metal and it will not blow away Also the flux is always making the pocket of gas which keeps the electric arc from going out Welding that uses shielding gas usually cannot be used outside because the gas would blow away if there were any wind

Some kinds of welding do not use an electric arc They might use a flame electricity without an arc an energy beam or physical force The most common type of welding that does not use an arc is called gas welding In gas welding a flammable gas and oxygen are combined and burn at the end of a torch Gas welding does not need any special shielding because a flame which is adjusted right has no extra oxygen in it It is still important to make sure the metal is clean The flame heats up the metal so much that it melts When both the pieces of metal are melted at the edge the liquid metal becomes one piece

The other kind of welding that does not use an arc still uses electricity It is called resistance welding With this kind two pieces of thin metal are pinched together and then electricity is made to go through them This makes the metal get really hot and melt where it is pinched together The two pieces melt together at that place Sometimes this is called spot welding because the welding can only happen at one small place at a time

Forge welding is the first kind of welding that ever was used Forge welding needs the two pieces of metal to so hot that they almost melt Then they are beat together with hammers until they are one piece

The other kinds of welding that do not use an arc are hard to do and usually new They are expensive too Most of these kinds of welding are only done where specially needed They might use an electron beam laser or ultrasonic sound waves

Every kind of welding needs to use energy This energy is usually heat but sometimes force is used to make a weld When heat is used it can be from electricity or from fire

A lot of electricity is used in arc welding Some kinds of welding use alternating current like the electricity that buildings use Other kinds use direct current like the electricity in a car or most things with a battery Almost all kinds of welding use a lower voltage than the electricity that comes from a power plant Arc welding requires using a special power supply that makes the electricity from the power plant usable for welding A power supply lowers the voltage and controls the amount of current The power supply usually has controls on it that allow these things to be changed For kinds of arc welding that use alternating current sometimes the power supply can do special things to make the electricity alternate differently Some power supplies do not plug into a power plug but instead generate their own electricity These kind of power supplies have an engine that turns a generator head to make the electricity The engine might run on gasoline diesel fuel or propane

OFW uses a flame from burning fuel gas and oxygen to heat up the metal This fuel gas is almost always acetylene Acetylene is a flammable gas that burns very hot hotter than any other gas That is why it is used most of the time Other gases like propane natural gas or other industrial gases can be used too

Some kinds of welding do not use heat to make the weld These kinds of welding can get hot but they do not make the metal melt Forge welding is an example of this Friction stir welding is a special kind of welding that does not use heat It uses a very powerful motor and a special spinning bit to mix the metals together at the edge This seems odd because metals are a solid this is why it takes a lot of force to do and is very hard The energy for this kind of welding is mechanical energy from the spinning bit

Stalk sometimes means following something to watch it A person who likes to watch other people is also known as a voyeur When this is continually done to a person it can have a bad effect

Stalking in a way that makes someone feel unsafe is a crime in many countries It is not just one event but an ongoing process that threatens or makes that person feel scared Someone who does this is called a stalker The stalker may do this because they want to be involved in that persons life because they want to have power over that persons life or for other sexual reasons The stalker can hurt that persons feelings by making them scared They may feel they do not have the power to stop the stalker Psychologists say stalking is a way of hurting someones mind with serious effects Sometimes a stalker may go on to hurt that persons body by assaulting raping or murdering that person

Stalking can sometimes be done on the internet This is called Cyber stalking

Ham is meat that comes from a thigh of a pig Ham is a kind of pork which is any meat from a pig

Ham can be dry cured or wet cured Dry cured ham is made by rubbing the meat with a mixture with salt Then it is dried and aged Wet cured ham is made with brine

Kinds of dry cured ham

Ham is used in SPAM

Spam is a canned meat food made by the Hormel Foods Corporation It is made from pork shoulder meat and ham Spam Lite a newer kind of Spam is made with pork and chicken

There have been many ideas about what the word Spam means The Hormel Foods Corporation once said that it means Shoulder of Pork and Ham but in some dictionaries Spam means SPiced hAM

Spam also refers to unwanted bulk email

Monty Python created a skit about Spam in 1970 There is also a song entitled spam sung by Weird Al Yankovic

A mushroom is the fruiting body of a kind of fungus Unlike plants mushrooms do not use sunlight to make energy for themselves A toadstool is a poisonous mushroom Some mushrooms that can be eaten are used for cooking in many countries such as China Korea and many European countries People who look for mushrooms to eat are called mycophagists meaning mushroom eater The act of looking for mushrooms is simply called mushrooming

It is hard to pick mushrooms in the wild because most mushrooms have look alikes Mushroom hunters learn how to tell these look alikes apart usually by chemical features Edible mushrooms are used in cooking in many cultures and are usually grown in farms In some places in the world people learn already in childhood to recognize the edible and delicious mushrooms in the wild

Most mushrooms have a stem and a cap The bottom of the cap sometimes has gills to hold spores and sometimes holds the spores themselves

Factorization is taking a composite number apart into numbers that multiply together to get the original number These smaller numbers are called factors or divisors 1 is a factor of all numbers

Prime factorization is breaking apart a composite numbers into prime numbers that can be multiplied to give the larger number Note that since 1 is not prime it is not included in the prime factorization

For example 12 can be factorized as 4 3 Since 4 is not a prime number that is not its prime factorization 12s prime factorization is in fact 3 2 2

The numbers which are obtained from the factorization are usually ordered for example starting with the smallest number For example 722332 The factorization of every number is unique This generalizes to

Since finding the numbers to multiply together is very difficult for large numbers this fact can be used in cryptography

A joint is the place at which two bones make contact Joints allow movement and give mechanical support

Joints have cartilage in between to make the movement flexibleJoints are mainly classified structurally and functionally Structural classification is determined by how the bones connect to each other while functional classification is determined by the degree of movement between the articulating bones In practice there is significant overlap between the two types of classifications

Euclid of Alexandria was a Greek mathematician who lived in Alexandria Egypt and worked at the Library of Alexandria Little is known about this person but people think he lived there when Ptolemy I was Pharaoh It is not known where or when he was born

Euclid collected together all that was known of geometry which is part of mathematics His Elements is the main source of ancient geometry Textbooks based on Euclid have been used up to the present day In the book he starts out from a small set of axioms Euclid then shows the properties of geometric objects and of whole numbers based on those axioms

The Elements also includes works on perspective conic sections spherical geometry and possibly quadric surfaces Apart from geometry the work also includes number theory Euclid came up with the idea of greatest common divisors They were in his Elements The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the greatest number that can fit evenly in both of the two numbers

The geometrical system described in the Elements was long known simply as geometry and was considered to be the only geometry possible Today that system is referred to as Euclidean geometry to distinguish it from other so called non Euclidean geometries that mathematicians discovered in the 19th century

In addition to the Elements at least five works of Euclid have survived to the present day They follow the same logical structure as Elements with definitions and proved propositions

The apostrophe is a punctuation mark used in writing It is a diacritic 

In English it has two jobs

The most common grammatical mistake in written English is to put its where its is correct 

The same applies to yours theirs and ours because these are also possessive adjectives of personal pronouns

Apostropes are also used to show something belongs to someone Again correct uses can be expanded

Comes in plurals which dont need it Do not put an apostrophe in word ending in s such as a plural Put an apostrophe or s at the end of the word instead

Apostrophes are also used when other words are shortened as in slang

This is just a version of the abbreviation function

A by election or bye election is a type of special election

A General Election is the name of an election for all members of an elected body A by election is the name of an election for just some members

A by election could be needed if a member dies or resigns while in political office They are also used if a person is removed from office for some reason for example he is guilty of a crime or is not qualified to be a member anymore

In the 1980s all 12 of the Unionist MPs in the British House of Commons resigned and all of the elections happened on the same day Although unusual these were still only by elections

A secretary is a person who is employed to help in an office and help the people in charge of the office do their job 

By definition the main task of a secretary is to keep organized paper and electronic files for the business school hospital or government agency they work for Other common jobs that secretaries do are answering telephones typing and writing letters plan and schedule meetings with guests and manage the website of their office

In different workplaces and for different reasons a secretary may also be called an administrative assistant receptionist clerk or executive assistant

In the past most secretaries were men Today 98 of secretaries are women according to the US Census 

In 1952 several groups for example the National Secretaries Association founded Secretarys Day It is celebrated in the 4th week of April It has been renamed Administrative Professionals Week to represent the more challenging roles of secretaries today 

In government secretaries are important people who hold high positions in government Many secretaries in government are in charge of government agencies 

In the United Kingdom a Secretary of State is a senior Cabinet Minister in charge of a Government Department 

In the United States the Secretary of State is in charge of dealing with other countries The current US Secretary of State is Hillary Rodham Clinton

Happiness is a feeling of pleasure and good ol satisfaction When someone feels good proud relieved or satisfied about something that person may be described as happy Feeling happy may help people to relax and to smile 

Happiness is usually thought of as the opposite of sadness However it is possible to feel both at once often about different things or sometimes even about the same thing

Many philosopherswho have said that people in this world go back and forth between times of happiness and sadness but there is nobody who is always happy or always sad Happiness sometimes causes you to cry when you laugh because the emotion takes control Happiness is the key to love

A number is called a perfect number if by adding all the positive divisors of the number the result is the number itself

Six is the first perfect number Its divisors are 1 2 and 3 and 1 2 3 equals 6 Other perfect numbers include 28 496 and 8128

Euclid discovered that the first four perfect numbers are generated by the formula 2n1

Euclid saw that 2n 1 is a prime number in these four cases He then proved that the formula 2n1 gives an even perfect number whenever 2n 1 is prime

Two millennia after Euclid Euler proved that the formula 2n1 will yield all the even perfect numbers Therefore every Mersenne prime will yield a distinct even perfect numberthere is a concrete one to one association between even perfect numbers and Mersenne primes This result is often referred to as the Euclid Euler Theorem Till September 2009 only 47 Mersenne primes are known This means there are 47 perfect numbers known the largest being 243112609 with 25956377 digits

The first 39 even perfect numbers are 2n1 for

Even perfect numbers have a very precise form odd perfect numbers are rare if indeed they do exist There are a number of results on perfect numbers that are actually quite easy to prove but nevertheless superficially impressive some of them also come under Richard Guys Strong Law of Small Numbers

The sum of proper divisors gives various other kinds of numbers Numbers where the sum is less than the number itself are called deficient and where it is greater than the number abundant These terms together with perfect itself come from Greek numerology A pair of numbers which are the sum of each others proper divisors are called amicable and larger cycles of numbers are called sociable A positive integer such that every smaller positive integer is a sum of distinct divisors of it is a practical number

By definition a perfect number is a fixed point of the restricted sum of divisors function s  n and the aliquot sequence associated with a perfect number is a constant sequence

StarCraft is a real time strategy game for the PC It was created in 1998 by Blizzard Entertainment

The story is set in the future where humans get stuck in a war between two alien species the Zerg and the Protoss The Zerg look like monsters and are all controlled by a very powerful Zerg called the Overmind They fly around the universe and invade planets The Protoss who have very advanced technology look for the planets that the Zerg have taken over When they find a Zerg planet they burn it so that the Zerg on that planet cannot spread to others

StarCraft players can choose to be the Protoss Zerg or Terran Each race has different soldiers and buildings Players can choose one player or multiplayer games In both the player must build a base gather resources and make fighters to attack the enemy

In one player mode there is the Campaign mode and Custom mode In Campaign mode the player goes through a series of missions which tell the story Custom mode lets a player choose what race they want to be what area they want to play on and what race they will fight against

During a game the player must use units to gather minerals and vespene gas They must also build structures or units which provide supplies Each type of unit costs a certain amount of gas minerals and supplies If the player does not have enough of a resource he or she cannot build more units Also there is a supply limit 200 units to make the game more fair Resources are gathered by worker units Minerals are needed for all units and buildings and come as blue crystals from the ground Vespene gas is needed for stronger units and comes as a geyser with green smoke blowing out of it A special building must be built on these geysers before worker units can gather the gas

There are many different buildings in the game Some buildings let the player build units and other buildings can make units stronger or do research to let more powerful units be built Every units needs something called supply which is supplied by buildings or units that are different in each species Players need to have supply because if they do not they cannot build any more units No player can have more than two hundred supply so they can only build a certain number of units

Each species has very different types of units The Protoss have powerful warriors and machinery which cost a lot and the Zerg use many fast cheap units to defeat their enemies The Terran are a middle between these having strong but easy to kill units that are very powerful when they are used in formation No species in StarCraft is more powerful than another species Blizzard has released many small updates to the game that keep all the species balanced 

To win players must capture and use resources wisely and use smart strategies To become very skilled at the game players also need to become good at micromanagement and macromanagement all at the same time Macromanagement means building new bases and collecting resources Micromanagement means moving units so that they can use their special powers to protect each other and doing many small things to make the fight go smoothly This makes StarCraft different from many newer games because the newer games often will do much of the micromanagement without the player having to do it

Starcraft is 12 years old but still played by many people in many countries around the world It is very popular in countries like Korea and the United States

On May 19 2007 Blizzard said that they are making StarCraft II Also they have held some events for South Korean Starcraft pro gamers to participate and give them assist about the game

Acid rain is rain that is unusually acidic In other words it is rain that has high levels of hydrogen ions Acid rain can have harmful effects on plants animals and on humans Acid rain is caused when gaseous compounds of ammonium carbon nitrogen and sulfur are released into the atmosphere The wind carries the gases high into the sky There the compounds react with the water in the atmosphere and acids are made

Scientists have realised that humans are resposible for giving out most of the compounds that cause acid rain People started producing acid rain gases when they started building factories and power stations The buildings burns coal or oil and this causes the acid rain gases So governments have tried since the 1970s to reduce the amount of sulfuric oxide being released into the Earths atmosphere They have had good results so far However it is expensive to clean the smoke from factories and power stations Great Britain still produces about five million tonnes of these gases every year China produces eighteen million tonnes The United States of America produces more than twenty million tonnes

Acid rain can can also be caused naturally For example it can be caused by nitrogen compounds can be split by the energy from lightning strikes and volcano eruptions can release sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere

Acid rain poisons rivers and lakes Fish and other animals cannot live in acid water It is also bad for buildings The acid damages the stone Many of the worlds oldest and most famous buildings are in danger because of acid rain

Anne Boleyn was executed in 1536 under the plotting of Thomas Cromwell Shortly after Henry VIII married Jane Seymour of England She had one son Edward VI of England But Jane died in 1537 due to medical problems caused by Edwards birth

Henry was eventually married to three other wives until his death in 1547 Edward his only living son succeeded him

Edward ruled until 1553 when he fell ill Immediately he created the Devise for Succession naming his cousin Lady Jane Grey his successor But Lady Jane was only queen for nine days

Mary I of England became the next ruler of the Tudor dynasty Because of her radical Catholicism Mary used her time as queen to rampage against hundreds of Protestants Because of all the executions carried out under her rule she was given the nickname Bloody Mary

After Marys death in 1558 her half sister Elizabeth I of England took over as queen bringing Protestant faith with her

The dynasty ended when Queen Elizabeth I died She had not named a person to be ruler after her death so her cousins son took over He became James I of England and started the Stuart dynasty

During the Tudor period there were many changes in religion Henry VIII for example was a Catholic but behaved like a Protestant as he broke away from the Popes power and named himself as head of the Church Edward VI was raised a Protestant and shut down all Catholic churches Mary I was a strong Catholic having been raised in Spain because of her Spanish mother Catharine of Aragon She shut down the Protestant churches and burnt about 300 people for being Protestant When Protestant Elizabeth came to the throne things changed and the Anglican church was introduced Since then religion in England has much calmer

The Tudors also conquered Ireland

Alchemy is a study of the basic elements called fire water earth and air It is the study of transmutation It was first studied to learn how to change lead into gold It is similar to chemistry but much older People who studied alchemy were called alchemists

Alchemists in the Middle Ages often tried to make gold using things that were not gold They also tried to make the Elixir of Life Many times alchemists would use stories and legends to try to veil how to make gold The psychologist Carl Gustav Jung was interested in this as well but in relation to the soul of man Alchemists are objective while psychologists are subjective Alchemists deal with the First Matter while Psychology deals with the mind A famous saying in Alchemy As above so below veils the relationship existing between Alchemy and Psychology 

Alchemy is not a science any more Some things that the alchemists learned about were important for other sciences like chemistry

In 1980 an American scientist named Glenn Seaborg actually changed a very tiny amount of bismuth into gold with a nuclear reactor But it cost much more to transform the energy to do this than the tiny amount of gold was worth This is the closest a scientist has come to discover the Philosophers Stone of the ancient Alchemists The Philosophers Stone is the means Alchemists use to achieve transmutation 

Alchemy was an important science because it helped create many other sciences that came after it for example Chemistry Physics Biology and astronomy Alchemists not only tried to create gold but they also looked for self purification and enlightenment

Anger is a negative feeling which often happens when a person thinks that someone or something has done something wrong bad or which puts them in danger and they want to stop the risk or punish the person for what they have done Anger may be the brains reaction if it thinks there may be pain  as part of the fight or flight decision When someone is angry anger becomes the feeling that has the biggest effect on what they do once a person makes the choice to do something without waiting to stop something which they think is a threat which puts them in danger

People show anger to others by their face what they do with their body not trying to understand or help other peoples problems and sometimes acts of aggression or force in public Animals and humans might try to intimidate  for example they could make loud sounds try to make their bodies look bigger bare their teeth or stare

Anger is a way to behave which is designed to make something showing aggression stop its threatening behavior Usually a fight will only happen after at least one of the people or animals fighting has shown anger Most people who become angry explain that it happened as a result of what has happened to them though it makes the angry person less aware of themselves and they tend to see the situation from their own viewpoint

Being angry changes the human body by making the heart beat faster increasing blood pressure and increasing amounts of the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline

Being angry makes the levels of the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline in the body go up although this does not last for very long

Adrenaline quickly makes the body ready to act when there is important trouble by increasing the supply of oxygen and glucose to the brain and muscles while slowing less important things the body is doing like digesting food

Noradrenaline is released during stress and goes to areas of the brain which control attention and reactions It is very important in the when the body chooses fight or flight so it increases heart rate starting glucose being taken out of stores of energy so it can be used and increasing blood flow to particular muscles

When a person has an anger problem he or she gets angry a lot more than usual people and are sometimes more violent People with anger issues have a short temper People with anger issues usually go to see a counselor to do therapy so the person can control their anger

A light microscope works a lot like a refracting telescope except that the object is very close to the objective lens An object to be studied for example a tiny organism found in pond water is put on a glass slide The clips on the microscopes flat stage hold the slide in place The stage can be adjusted to add more light It also moves to allow different layers of the object to be in focus The user looks through the microscope eyepiece A mirror at the bottom of the microscope reflects light rays up to the object through a hole in the stage Objective lenses magnify the image which is made even larger when it is seen through the eyepiece lenses

The light microscope is widely used in colleges and high schools It normally has a top magnification of 40x with the option of having 4x and 8x This lets the microscope have the ability to see basic cells and other items Some have 10x magnification

All modern optical microscopes designed for viewing samples by transmitted light share the same basic components of the light path listed here in the order the light travels through them In addition the vast majority of microscopes have the same structural components

These entries are numbered according to the image on the right

In order to overcome the limitations set by the diffraction limit of visible light other microscopes have been designed which use other waves

Chimpanzees are great apes of the genus Pan They live in Africa 

The Common Chimpanzee lives in West and Central Africa The Bonobo lives in the rain forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo The two species are on opposite sides of the Congo River

Chimpanzees mainly eat fruit leaves flowers seeds bark honey insects bird eggs and meat They spend a lot of time with other chimpanzees from their group acting up playing and chatting Sometimes they will groom each other combing and looking through each others thick fur picking out the dirt and insects Grooming helps chimps feel comfortable and friendly

Like apes chimpanzees can walk on two feet but they prefer to move about on all four legs They have hands that look like human hands but their thumbs are shorter than those of humans At night chimpanzees sleep in nests that they make on tree branches They bend twigs and tuck in leaves to make a soft platform to rest in a place that is safe from enemies on the ground The gestation period of chimpanzees lasts between six and eight months Usually only one offspring is produced they rarely have twins Chimpanzees live up to 60 years in the wild

Jane Goodall an expert primatologist has been studying chimpanzees since 1985 Dr Goodall observed how chimpanzees use tools in several ways They will pick up rocks to crack nuts for a meal They also strip down twigs and stick them into a termite mound to collect a tasty snack Some have been known to make a sponge from leaves in order to hold more drinking water The chimp chews leaves to soften them up dips them in rainwater and then squeezes the water into its mouth Chimpanzees are also known to think ahead and solve problems

Chimpanzees show their emotions with their faces and sounds They make hooting sounds to express the discovery of food and the face of a chimpanzee with a scowling face and lips pressed is to express annoyance This means the chimpanzee may attack Or the chimpanzee may bare its teeth to express that it is afraid or that a more dominant chimp is approachingp745

Bonobos are smaller than other chimpanzees They tend to climb in the trees more than other chimps They are more like monkeys in that way

According to a genome study done by the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium humans share either 96 or 95 of their DNA with chimpanzees However this applies only to single nucleotide polymorphisms that is changes in single base pairs only The full picture is rather different

24 of the chimpanzee genome does not align with the human genome ans so cannot be directly compared There are 3 further alignment gaps 123 SNP differences and 27 copy number variations totaling at least 30 differences between chimpanzee and Homo sapiens genomes On the other hand 30 of all human proteins are identical in sequence to the corresponding chimpanzee proteins

A meridian is an imaginary line of longitude drawn along the surface of the earth from the North Pole to the South Pole 

Geographers today measure these lines from what they call the Prime Meridian It is the line of longitude that goes through the Royal Greenwich Observatory in Greenwich England They decided this at the 1884 International Meridian Conference

Meridians as lines of longitude are measured in degrees The Prime Meridian as the starting point is 0 degrees Lines west of the Prime Meridian are either called west as in the longitude of Los Angeles California is 118 degrees west or as a negative number the longitude of Los Angeles California is 118 degrees Going the other direction east of the Prime Meridian is always said as a positive number The longitude of Mecca is about 40 degrees east or just The longitude of Mecca is about 40 degrees

Literacy means the ability to read and write Being able to read and write is an important skill in modern societies Usually people learn how to read and write at school People who can read and write are called literate those who cannot are called illiterate

According to UNESCO illiteracy is not being able to write or read a simple sentence in any language They estimated that in 1998 about 16 of the worlds population were illiterate 

Illiteracy is highest amongst the states of the Arab peninsula and in Africa around the Sahara In those countries about 30 of men and 40 50 of women are illiterate by the UN definition One of the causes of illiteracy is that someone who can manage to live without being able to read and write often does not have any reason to want to learn to read and write Cultural factors also play a part such as having a culture in which the oral tradition is more important than writing A tribe that mostly herds livestock for example may have no need to read or write 

There are two different kinds of illiteracy

The Isle of Man is an island in the Irish Sea off the coast of Great Britain Douglas is the capital city It also has a flag with a red background and 3 armoured legs joined together  whichever way you throw us we always land on our feet

It has a Parliament called Tynwald It is the longest running parliament in the world

The Isle of Man is a Crown dependency Foreign affairs defence and good government are handled by the British government but in all other matters the island is independent The Isle of Man Government is the executive and proposes laws to the legislature Tynwald Laws passed by Tynwald are given royal approval by the Lieutenant Governor unless the British Minister of Justice says they do not help the good government of the island

The Isle of Man is an island in the Irish Sea it is northwest of the European continent It is between the United Kingdom and Ireland The island is 13 km wide and 24 km long it has a total area of 572 km The Isle of Man has a total of 160 km of coastline it has no important bodies of water Apart from the island itself the Isle of Man also includes some nearby islands The most important of these islands are called Calf of Man St Patricks Ilse and St Michaels Isle

The islands terrain is varied it has mountains in the north and south A valley is more or less in the center of the island between the cities of Douglas and Peel The northern part of the island is very flat Snaefell is the Isle of Mans highest mountain it measures 621 meters above sea level It is said that you can see Scotland England Ireland and Wales from the top of mount Snaefell

The Isle of Man has a usually mild weather Summers are cool and winters are mild and rainy Rainfall is similar to that of the other British Isles Elevated parts of the Isle of Man get more rainfall especially mount Snaefell The northern and southern parts of the island are not as rainy as the rest

The islands weather is normally cool The highest temperature ever registered is 289 C in Ronaldsway The Isle of Man is not very sunny but it is less cloudy than other parts of the British Isles strong winds around the island help keep clouds in constant movement

The geology of Man is notable for the Iapetus Suture which runs almost unseen right through the rocks of the island The suture is the remnant of a once huge oocean the Iapetus Ocean which was lost about 420 million yeaars ago as three continents came together

The Isle of Man became separated from Ireland and the British Isles about 8500 years ago The short period of time between the melting of glaciers and the rise of sea level allowed a small number of species to colonize the island by land The island was heavily deforested in the Middle Ages this weakened the islands environment Some land is now protected by the government to help preserve its wildlife Curraghs Wildlife Park in the wetlands is home many species of animals and plants The island is also home to a large number of bird species

A lot of the Isle of Mans plant life or flora is composed of shrubs and other short plants Several species of grass and moss also live there Mosses on the island contribute to the formation of peat There is peat in the islands wet areas The island has heavily deforested in the Middle Ages Common trees on the island include ashes elms pines willows and hawthorns There are also other trees on the island as well as many species of flowering plants Bogs are home to ferns and orchids 

The Isle of Man is home to a large number of bird and insect species Many species live in curraghs Curraghs are protected by the Government of the Isle of Man Curraghs Wildlife Park is in these wetlands it is both a zoo and a protected area During the winter curraghs are the second largest nesting ground of the Hen Herrier in Europe The Peregrine Falcon Merlin European Robin Willow Warbler Song Thrush Dunnock Swan and a subspecies of Winter Wren possibly native to the island also nest in the curraghs The Chough is also in the Isle of Man it is more common than in other parts of Europe Some farming methods have decreased the bird population of the island The Northern Lapwing is now rarely found and the Yellowhammer is now extinct on the island

18 species of butterfly and 250 species of moth also live on the Isle of Man Most of them live in the wetlands during different seasons

The French Revolution was a time in French history between 1789 and 1799 During these years the government and ideas about how France should be ruled changed many times Generally ordinary people wanted more power and more rights 

The most famous event that began the Revolution was the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789 This led to the end of the monarchy and the start of the Terror in which thousands of people including the king of France Louis XVI were killed because they did not agree with the Revolution Many thousands more were killed in the Revolutionary Wars between France and countries that did not like the changes in France

The Revolution ended when Napoleon Bonaparte took power in November 1799 and began his dictatorship

Before 1789 France was ruled by the king the nobles and the church only This was called an absolute monarchy Most of the people had little power and were very poor The ideas of the Enlightenment were beginning to make these ordinary people want more power They could see that the American Revolution had created a country in which people had power instead of a king The government before the revolution was called the Old Regime

Many problems in France led up to the Revolution

The Revolution happened because King Louis XVI failed to deal with these problems

Before the Revolution France was divided into three Estates The First Estate was the Clergy and made up 1 of the population The Second Estate was the Nobility and made up 2 of the population The other 97 of the population was in the Third estate Representatives of the people from all three estates together made up the Estates General 

In May 1789 the Estates General was called by the King in order to deal with the money problems of the country They met at the royal Palace of Versailles However the members of the Third Estate were angry They had made lists of problems they wanted to fix called the Cahiers de Dolances

The members of the Third Estate were angry that they were being taxed the most when they were the poorest group of people They and the Director General of Finances Jacques Necker thought the Church and the Nobility ought to be taxed more 

They also wanted votes in the Estates General to be fairer Even though the Third Estate had lots more members than the other two Estates each Estate only had one vote in the Estates General The Third Estate thought this could be improved by giving members of the Estates General a vote each However when they talked to the other Estates they could not agree

Since the First and Second Estates would not listen The Third Estate decided to break away and start their own assembly where every member would get a vote On 10 June 1789 they started the National Assembly The king tried to stop them by closing the Salle des tats meeting room but they met in an indoor tennis court instead On June 20th they took the Tennis Court Oath where they promised to work until they had created a new constitution for France It is now used as a brothel

In July 1789 after the National Assembly was formed the nobility and the king were angry with Jacques Necker the Director General of Finances and they fired him Many Parisians thought the King was going to try to shut down the National Assembly Soon Paris was filled with riots and looting

On 14 July 1789 the people decided to attack the Bastille prison The Bastille contained weapons as well as being a symbol of the power of the nobility and the rule of the king the Ancien Rgime By the afternoon the people had broken into the Bastille and released the seven prisoners being held there They killed the Governor of the prison Bernard de Launay and put his head on a stick

The Members of the Third Estate took over Paris The president of the National Assembly at the time of the Tennis Court Oath Jean Sylvain Bailly became mayor of the city Jacques Necker was given back his job as Director General of Finances Soon the King visited Paris and took the red white and blue ribbons that the revolutionaries were wearing By the end of July the revolution had spread all over France

The National Assembly began to make lots of changes On 4 August the concept of feudalism was ended putting a stop to the rights of the Nobility over their people and the special taxes the Church was collecting On 26 August the National Assembly published the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen which was written by the nobleman Marquis LaFayette 

The National Assembly began to decide how it would be under the new constitution Many members especially the nobles wanted a senate or a second upper house However more people voted to keep having just one assembly The King was given a suspensive veto over law which meant he would only have the power to delay laws being made not stop them In October 1789 after being attacked at the Palace of Versailles by a mob of 7000 women the King was convinced by LaFayette to move to Paris to the palace called Tuileries

The Assembly began to divide into different parties One was made up of those against the revolution led by the nobleman Jacques Antoine Marie de Cazales and the churchman Jean Sifrien Maury This party sat on the right side A second party was the Royalist democrats which wanted to create a system like the constitutional monarchy of Britain where the king would still be a part of the government Jacques Necker was in this party The third party was the National Party which was centre or centre left This included Honore Mirabeau and LaFayette 

Under the new government the Roman Catholic Church would have much less power than they had before In 1790 all special taxes and powers of the Church were cancelled All the Churchs property was taken over by the state On 12 July 1790 the Civil Constitution of the Clergy made all clergy employees of the state and made them take an oath to the new constitution Many clergy as well as the Pope Pius VI did not like these changes

On 14 July 1790 a year since the storming of the Bastille thousands of people gathered in the Champs de Mars to celebrate Charles Maurice de Talleyrand led the crowd in a religious mass The crowd including the King and the royal family took an oath of loyalty to the nation the law and the king However many nobles were unhappy with the revolution and were leaving the country They were called migrs

Although the members of the Estates General had only been elected for a year the members of the Assembly had all taken the Tennis Court Oath They had promised to keep working until they had a constitution and no constitution had been made It was decided that the members would keep working until they had a constitution

The Assembly continued to work on a constitution and make changes Nobles could no longer pass their titles to their children Only the king was allowed to do this For the first time trials with juries were held All trade barriers inside France were ended along with unions guilds and workers groups Strikes were banned 

Many people with radical ideas began to form political clubs The most famous of these was the Jacobin Club which had left wing ideas A right wing club was the Club Monarchique In 1791 a law was suggested to prevent noble migrs from leaving the country Mirabeau had been against this law but he died on 2 April and by the end of the year the law was passed

Louis XVI did not like the revolution but did not want to get help from other countries or run away from France like the migrs General Bouille held the same views and wanted to help the king leave Paris He said that he would give the King and his family help and support in his camp at Montmdy The escape was planned for June 20 1791 Dressed as servants the royal family left Paris However their escape was not well planned and they were arrested at Varennes on the evening of June 21 The royal family was brought back to Paris The Assembly imprisoned Louis and his wife Marie Antoinette and suspended the king from his duty

Although the king had tried to escape most members of the Assembly still wanted to include the king in their government rather than to have a Republic with no king at all They agreed to make the king a figurehead with very little power The king would have to take an oath to the state If he did not or if he created an army to attack France he would no longer be king

Some people including Jacques Pierre Brissot did not like this They thought the king should be completely removed from the throne and the constitution Brissot made a petition and a huge crowd came to the Champs de Mars to sign it Republican leaders Georges Danton and Camille Desmoulins came and gave speeches 

The National Guard led by LaFayette was called in to control the crowd The mob threw stones at the soldiers who first fired their guns over the heads of the crowd When the crowd kept throwing stones LaFayette ordered them to fire at the people Up to 50 people were killed After this the government closed many of the political clubs and newspapers Many radical left wing leaders including Danton and Desmoulins ran away to England or hid in France

Finally the constitution was completed Louis XVI was put back on the throne and came to take his oath to it He wrote I engage to maintain it at home to defend it from all attacks from abroad and to cause its execution by all the means it places at my disposal The National Assembly decided that it would stop governing France on 29 September 1791 After that date the Legislative Assembly would take over

The new Legislative Assembly met for the first time on October 1791 Under the Constitution of 1791 France was a Constitutional Monarchy The King shared his rule with the Legislative Assembly but had the power to stop laws he did not like He also had the power to choose ministers The Legislative Assembly had about 745 members 165 of them were Feuillants or Constitutional Monarchists 330 were Girondins and Jacobins left wing liberal republicans who did not want a king The other 250 members were independent but they voted most often with the left wing 

The Legislative Assembly did not agree very well The King used his veto to stop laws that would sentence migrs with death Because so many of the members of the Assembly were left wing they did not like this 

The kings and emperors of many foreign countries were worried by the French Revolution They did not want revolution in their own countries On 27 August 1791 Leopold II of the Holy Roman EmpireAustria Frederick William II of Prussia and Louis XVIs brother Charles Philippe wrote the Declaration of Pillnitz The Declaration asked for Louis XVI to be set free and the National Assembly to be ended They promised that they would invade France if their requests were ignored The Declaration was taken very seriously in among the revolutionaries

With the Legislative Assembly in place the problems did not go away The Girondins wanted war because they wanted to take the revolution to other countries The King and many of his supporters the Feuillants wanted war because they thought it would make the King more popular Many French were worried that the migrs would cause trouble in foreign countries against France

On 20 April 1792 the Assembly voted to declare war on Austria They planned to invade the Austrian Netherlands but the revolution had made the army weak Many soldiers deserted Soon Prussia joined on the Austrian side They both planned to invade Together on 25 July they wrote the Brunswick Manifesto promising that if the royal family was not hurt no civilians would be hurt in the invasion The French believed that this meant the king Louis XVI was working with the foreign kings Prussia invaded France on 1 August 1792 This first stage of the French Revolutionary Wars continued until 1797

The people were turning against King Louis XVI On 10 August 1792 the members of a revolutionary group called the Paris Commune attacked the Tuileries where the King and Queen were living The King and Queen were taken prisoner The Legislative Assembly held an emergency meeting Even though only a third of the members were there and most of them were Jacobins they suspended the King from duty

In September things got worse The Legislative Assembly had almost no power No single group was controlling Paris or France The country was being invaded by the Prussian Army The revolutionaries were very angry and violent They began to go into prisons and kill people they thought were traitors to France They hated the priests of the Roman Catholic Church the most but many nobles and ordinary people were also killed By 7 September 1400 people were dead

The Legislative Assembly had lost all its power A new government was needed On 20 September 1792 the National Convention was formed The Convention had both Girondins and radical Jacobins 

The Brunswick Manifesto had made many people suspicious of the king They thought he was plotting with the Prussian and Austrian rulers to invade France In January 1793 the National Convention voted and found Louis XVI guilty of conspiracy against the public liberty and the general safety On the twenty first of January the King was executed using the guillotine Marie Antoinette the Queen was executed on the sixteenth of October

People in the area of Vende did not like the revolutionary government They did not like the rules about the church in the Civil Constitution of the Church and new taxes put in place in 1793 They also disliked being forced to join the French army In March they rose up against the government in a revolt The war lasted until 1796 Hundreds of thousands of people from Vende were killed by the Revolutionary French army

Now that the king was dead The National Convention made a new republican constitution that began on 24 June It was the first one that did not include the king and gave every man in France a vote However it never came into power because of the trouble between the Jacobins and Girondins The war with Austria and Prussia was causing the state to have money problems Bread was very expensive and many people wanted things to change In June 1793 the Jacobins began to take power They wanted to arrest many Girondin members of the National Convention In July they were made more angry when Charlotte Corday a Girondin killed Jean Paul Marat a Jacobin 

By July the coup was complete The Jacobins had taken power They put in new radical laws including a new Republican Calendar with new months and new ten day weeks They made the army bigger and changed the officers to people who were better soldiers Over the next few years this helped the Republican army push back the attacking Austrians Prussians British and Spanish

In July 1793 a Jacobin called Maximilien de Robespierre and eight other leading Jacobins set up the Committee of Public Safety It was the most powerful group in France This group and Robespierre were in charge of the Terror Robespierre believed that if people were afraid the revolution would go better The Terror lasted from the spring of 1793 to the spring of 1794 

It was not only the nobility who died in the Terror Any one who broke the Jacobins laws or was even suspected of breaking their laws or working against them could be arrested and sent to the guillotine most without a trial Even powerful people who had been involved in the Jacobin coup were executed Prisoners were taken from the prisons to Madame Guillotine in an open wooden cart called the tumbrel 

According to records 16594 people were executed with the guillotine It is possible that up to 40000 people died in prison or were killed during the Terror

By July 1794 people began to turn against Maximilien de Robespierre He and his Revolutionary Tribunal had killed 1300 people in six weeks On 27 July The National Convention and the Committee of Public Safety turned against him Robespierre tried to get help from the Conventions right wing members but he failed 

A day later Robespierre and many of his supporters in the Paris Commune were sent to the guillotine without any kind of trial This reaction against Robespierre is called the Thermidorian Reaction

Now that the terror was over the National Convention started to make a new Constitution called the Constitution of the Year III On 27 September 1794 the constitution came into effect

The new constitution had created the Directory which was the first government of France to be bicameral The lower house the parliament had 500 members It was called the Conseil de Cinq Cent The upper house the senate had 250 members and it was called the Conseil des Anciens There were five directors chosen every year by the Conseil des Anciens from a list made up by the Conseil de Cinq Cent This group was in charge and was called the Directory

Although the constitution of 1793 had given all men in France a vote in this constitution only people with a certain amount of property could vote The Directory was much more conservative than the governments in France since 1789 The people were tired of radical changes and the unstable governments Things were much more stable under the Directory than they had been before

However the Directors were disliked by the people especially the Jacobins who wanted a republic and royalists who wanted a new King Frances money problems did not go away The Directors ignored elections that did not go the way they wanted They ignored the constitution in order to do things to control the people They used the ongoing war and the army to keep their power

People rioted against the Directory but the Directory used the army to stop them The army under the Corsican general Napoleon Bonaparte became much more powerful On 9 November 1799 Bonaparte took power This event is called 18 Brumaire Napoleon Bonaparte set up a new government called the Consulate with him in power This led to him becoming the dictator and in 1804 the Emperor of France

The 18 Brumaire marks the end of the Republican part of the French Revolution

FileBadische GuillotineJPGthumbright175pxGuillotine

The guillotine is a machine used to kill people as death penalty It got its first common use in France during the French Revolution of 1789 It was in common use in France Switzerland Germany and Austria and also used in Sweden Since all those countries have stopped capital punishment the guillotine is no longer in use

A guillotine consists of a heavy blade attached to a rack which moves on a vertical frame When the rack is released it will fall down and the blade will cut the convicts head off Such devices were first invented in the Middle Ages and used throughout Europe But it was only during the French Revolution when guillotine rose to general usage

The Guillotine is named after a French doctor of medicine Joseph Ignace Guillotin Guillotin proposed to use a mechanical device to carry out all the executions His proposition was on October 101789 Although Guillotin contributed little to the design of the machine his name went down in history The machine was devised by another doctor Antoine Louis Against the will of Guillotin the device rapidly became known as Guillotine Guillotin regretted thisup to his death in 1814 Guillotin wanted to have a more humane way of execution However Guillotin was against the death penalty and thought there was a better way to execute people

The design for a quick painless decapitation machine was given to Tobias Schmidt a German Engineer Schmidt built the first guillotine and tested it on animals at first but later on dead humans It was made of two fourteen foot uprights joined by a crossbar whose inside edges were grooved and greased with tallow the weighted blade was either straight or curved like an axe The system was started by a rope and pulley while the whole construction was set up on a platform 

The guillotine remained as the legal means of death penalty in France until 1979 when death penalty was stopped in France In the Nazi Germany guillotine was used to kill prisoners sentenced for serious crimes such as murder treason or conspiring against the government Guillotine was last time used in West Germany 1949 and East Germany 1961 The last person guillotined was Tunisian murderer Hamida Djandoubi in 1977

This page tries to answer the main questions teachers may have about Wikipedia It also suggests a good way of starting to use the Simple English Wikipedia in the classroom If you dont know much about Wikipedia read WikipediaAbout for a basic introduction

Wikipedia aims to be the ultimate learning resource the sum of all human knowledge Yet a lot of students may have difficulty understanding the complex language used by the English Wikipedia They may need a simpler version which is easier to understand and which should still give them the information they need The Simple English Wikipedia is an encyclopedia to help make this happen to give students and learners of English with a simple free resource

Ideas such as open source copyleft collaborative writing and volunteer contributions for the public good are sometimes new and unusual ideas in educational settings Wikipedia offers a chance for educators to explore concepts of public trust which are likely to continue growing in importance during the lives of todays record population of youth

Generally yes Wikipedia is accurate Wikipedia is developing rapidly the reliability of the encyclopedia is improving all the time Because readers compare articles to what they already know articles tend to become more accurate and detailed Certain articles about many of the major sciences were developed from other free or public domain encyclopedias This provides a reliable basis upon which encyclopedia writers can develop more current information Wikipedia is cited almost daily in the press

On the other hand it is possible for an article on Wikipedia to be biased outdated or factually incorrect This is true for any resource One should always double check the accuracy of important facts regardless of the source In general popular articles are more accurate because they are read more often For this reason factual errors are spotted and corrected in a more timely fashion In particular there may be a Western bias since that is where most contributors are from

Nothing Anyone can at this very moment go to almost any page and change the information to make it misleading or wrong Very specific minor facts like an exact date for a not very important historical detail are less trustworthy since vandals sometimes change them

However it probably will not stay that way very long Many contributors watch the list of changes and will quickly delete nonsense or obviously wrong articles and undo baseless edits Many users watch Wikipedias recent changes particularly for those from anonymous users and major articles are usually on several individuals personal watch lists as well If an anonymous or relatively new user changes a number or a date by a little bit without justifying their edit it is particularly likely to raise a red flag

But Wikipedia cannot be perfect There is almost certainly inaccurate information in it somewhere which has not yet been discovered to be wrong Therefore if you are using Wikipedia for important research or a school project you should always verify the information somewhere else just like you should with all sources

Wikipedia can be an excellent starting place for further research Teachers might ask students what they did to validate the information they learned from Wikipedia Using a comprehensive search engine such as Google students can easily compare Wikipedia content with information from other reputable websites Students can compare information in Wikipedia with information in other encyclopedias or books In addition most of our better articles have sections such as References Sources Notes Further reading or Other web sites which generally contain information about sources

For purposes of establishing authorship and finding more sources students may also find the articles History tabs useful as these detail every contribution the contributor and what he or she contributed All of our registered contributors have Talk pages for leaving them notes and many can be contacted through a form on this website by other registered users including students if they choose to register A toolbox link is also visible on user pages while logged in

Wikipedia is as safe as most interactive online environments Participation in Wikipedia is probably safe for youths who know basic Internet safety practices Wikipedia is not a social organization and provides few opportunities for casual social interaction Because other editors routinely monitor Wikipedia inappropriate activity is quickly noticed and stopped

However Wikipedia is not censored It contains articles on subjects such as racial slurs or sexual acts It also contains pages on political or religious groups and movements which may be seen as controversial by certain people or groups of people Pages which are normally appropriate for children to use are occasionally vandalized with rude words or content which may be offensive Vandalism is normally noticed and removed within short time periods but it is still possible that a person may access a page before this is dealt with Teachers should supervise young children on Wikipedia as they would in any other online environment 

However a childrens charity and the Wikimedia Foundation have produced a static safe selection from Wikipedia aimed at UK School children see 

Open source media is a kind of information produced by open groups of developers in which anybody who wants to can use the information Open source production emerged among software engineers with the production of GNULinux an open source computer operating system MediaWiki is an open source software package that supports an open source encyclopedia

Open source production relies on qualified users to maintain a constantly improving collection whether it is an open collection of computer code or of encyclopedic information Open source collections typically maintain back up resources so if a developer accidentally damages the code or the content it can easily be reverted to an earlier stable version The same backup system provides protection against malicious damage to an open source project 

Few surveys have developed reliable answers to why people contribute to open source works like Wikipedia Some sort of public interest or community spirit is often part of the motive Open source projects offer an opportunity to contribute to something that has lasting value and that will continue to grow Open source publishing allows writers and software developers to apply their skills outside of a strictly business environment Casual writers and editors sometimes participate as a hobby or as a learning experience

Wikipedia is relatively new but chances are always getting better than ever that you have heard of it before Wikipedias rapid growth recently has been reported in many prominent media outlets Wikipedia was established in January 2001 and is now making a place for itself in the worlds collection of knowledge As the encyclopedia grows more people learn about it every day much in the same way Internet use grew in the late 1990s

Many other online encyclopedias simply copy Wikipedia which is allowed because it is Open Source This should be mentioned on the page but the message can be hard to notice So you may have come across a Wikipedia article without knowing it However considering the speed at which Wikipedia develops these are often quite out of date

Wikipedia does not advertise as many new services do so public knowledge of Wikipedia is mostly a result of word of mouth readers discovering the service while browsing online or people learning about the encyclopedia from news reports 

Most young people will likely at some point become involved in interactive online activities For educators youths involvement with Wikipedia provides an opportunity to survey youths understanding of online safety and to teach appropriate practices Educators can use Wikipedia as a way of teaching students to develop hierarchies of credibility that are essential for navigating and conducting research on the Internet

Wikipedia provides an opportunity for teachers to discuss the concept of the public domain Wikipedia is an opportunity to take part in an open community that relies primarily on mutual respect and cooperation but which is not related to familiar authority figures some young people might tend to oppose

Editing in Wikipedia is an opportunity to learn to participate in collective editorial processes Wikipedia presents a ready opportunity for youths to research compile and publish articles for peer review For young people who contribute images selection and production of an image provides opportunities to learn what a market wants from an artist Young people who master skills for accurate writing and drawing about encyclopedic subjects are better equipped to develop their own style in more creative genres

Because all articles in Wikipedia must conform to neutral point of view students taking part in collaborative editing activities on Wikipedia are building experience in detecting and eliminating bias in writing

There are two ways you can give your students access to Wikipedia

This allows students to access and edit Wikipedia without a username This can increase the risk of the IP address being blocked As many schools share the same IP address this would most likely stop every student in the school from editing until the block expires

This gives less control over edits made by students but each students contribution is easily identified Although this will most likely avoid school wide blocks it is difficult to watch all of your students contributions and check for offensive content It is recommended that if this method is used the students all have usernames that can be easily identified as part of the group To prevent spamming there is also a limit on the number of accounts that can be created in one day which is six It is best to request an administrator to create accounts for your group as they can override these limits and alert the others that a school project is in process

Please let the administrators know about the planned date and time of your activity and the usernamesIP you will be using Hopefully admins will then be available to provide assistance to you and your students

  

Make sure all students take the five minute student tutorial This will give them a basic introduction to the concepts of Wikipedia and how to edit

After the tutorial you could let students try out their editing in the sandbox before giving them their project or tasks This helps to cut down on the work for other contributors removing the nonsense that your students will inevitably put on articles to test out their new skills Remember testing is fine vandalism is not

  

You decide There are hundreds of possible projects and tasks students can complete on Wikipedia

  

To check what your students are submitting on a class username click the MediaWikiMycontris link in the upper right corner of your screen This will show all contributions under that username Click next to an item to see what changes have been made

If you find any inappropriate edits by your students you need to revert it as quickly as possible To do this from the revision differences page click the link to the previous version of the page which will probably look something like Revision as of CURRENTTIME CURRENTDAY CURRENTMONTHNAME CURRENTYEAR You will be taken to the older version of the page Click the change this page link Make no changes but place rvt  TEACHER in the edit summary box

When you save the page the edits will be overwritten You can then warn students about vandalism and how it could lead to blocking  ruining the entire classs projects may put off the vandalizing student

  

Most members of Wikipedia will be willing to help you if you ever have any problems just leave a note on their talk page If you require an administrator for more advanced operations such as edit deletion see WikipediaAdministrators

On the error page you see if you try to edit a page you will see the administrator who blocked your usernameIP address You can then appeal to this administrator to be unblocked Remember being a school user does not grant you unlimited rights In other words if your class vandalise a large amount of pages you will be blocked and have no priority for unblocking It is up to you to maintain control of your students  Wikipedia administrators must protect the encyclopedia

Just add deleteUseless page  school user to the top of the page Replace useless page with another reason if you think it is not appropriate This adds the page to the list of pages to be deleted An administrator will then be able to delete this page

A school uniform is a standard set of clothing people wear when they go to school It might have a particular color of trousers or skirt plus a matching shirt and perhaps a jacket or necktie with matching socks and shoes

In some countries like the Netherlands students can wear anything they like when they go to school In other countries like England there is a standard dress code in school This usually means that there is a set of dressing for girls and one for boys The boys and girls need to wear school uniforms when they go to school In many countries such as the United States some schools require wearing a uniform and some do not

Originally school uniforms were introduced to hide the social differences between students but uniforms can also help with safety Using standard uniforms can also save the money needed to buy extra clothes as fashion to impress other people at school The uniforms can reduce the conspicuous consumption of wealthy people who get costly items which show how much more wealth they have than other people

However school uniforms can also help with health and safety by having clothes which have been tested to be safer when worn Some fabrics can cause skin rashes in some people while a uniform can be made of comfortable fabrics Also loose fitting clothes can get caught in machinery or playground equipment which limits what activities children can do safely

There are several types of economic bullying which can be lessened by use of school uniforms When many students are from families with less money sometimes students with more money have been called goody two shoes because they wore newer shoes where neither of the 2 shoes was in poor shape In schools where more students are wealthy the poorer students have been insulted for the old style or tattered clothes they wore

Some children do not like uniforms because they do not have a choice in what they can wear

Primates are a group of mammals that contains all lemurs monkeys and apes including humans There are about 400 species of primates All primates are similar to humans in some ways Primates have hands with five fingers fingernails Primates are split into two groups Strepsirrhini and Haplorrhini Haplorrhini includes monkeys tarsiers and apes including humans Strepsirrhini includes lemurs lorises galagoes and the Aye Aye

The Tropic of Cancer is one of the five major circles of latitude that are often marked on maps of the Earth This is the parallel of latitude that is 23 26 22 north of the Equator

Equinox is when the sun passes directly over the equator There are two equinoxes each year Equinox can also mean either of the two days when this happens On these days the nights are equal in length at latitudes L North and L South The word equinox comes from two Latin words meaning equal and night Around the day of the equinox the length of the day is a little over twelve hours and the length of the night is a little under twelve hours because the sun is not a point in the sky and because the sunlight bends as it comes to earth The exact day and time when this happens depend on how far away from the equator it is being measured They occur on or around March 21 and September 21 Solstices fall around June 21st and December 21st at odd intervals

The equinoxes are the beginning of spring and autumn

The time of daylight is quite easy to measure This was done in many cultures where festivals were celebrated at the equinoxes

The Teufelsbrcke is a bridge over the river Reuss in the Swiss canton of Uri

The valley called Schllenenschlucht is an important access route to the StGotthard alpine pass However the valley is very narrow featuring a dangerous river Reuss 

The first bridge across the river was built in 1230 This was a wooden bridge This meant that due to bad weather it had to be replaced often 

In the 16th century it was replaced by a bridge of stone That stone bridge was heavily damaged in the Napoleonic wars in 1799 Nobody could use the bridge because of the damage Trade with Italy was done over the alpine pass at Splgen

The first bridge was completely destroyed in a stormy night in 1888

Only in 1820 could the order to build a new bridge be given The construction of the bridge took 10 years

In the middle of the 20th century the second bridge was no longer able to handle the traffic A third bridge featuring two lanes one for each direction was built in 1958

Building the first bridge was very hard According to a local myth the first bridge was built by the devil himself The condition attached was that the devil should get the soul of the first to pass over the bridge So when the bridge was finished people chased a goat over the bridge Of course the devil was furious so he went to pick up a large stone He wanted to smash the bridge he just built to pieces On his way to the ridge however he encountered an old believing woman with a cross Scared of the cross he left the stone and fled

The devils stone weighs 220 tons 300000 Swiss Francs were used in 1977 to shift the stone 127 meters to make way for the motorway passing over the StGotthard pass

Popular belief has it that the moving of the stone was the cause of an increased number of accidents on kilometre 16 on the St Gotthard road tunnel

The term grandparent means the parents of a persons parents The term grandparent is used for both male and female genders The male grandparent is a grandfather The female grandparent is a grandmother 

When looking at the relationship from the point of veiw of the grandparent the term grandchild is used A grandchild is the child of a persons child It can also be used based on gender Grandchild is correct for either gender Grandson is male Granddaughter is female

For example Bob has a son That son has 2 children a boy and a girl Bob is the grandfather of both Billy and Mary Billy is the grandson of Bob and Mary is the granddaughter of Bob Bobs wife would be the grandmother of both Mary and Billy 

Leptons are elementary particles with spin 12 that are not affected by strong nuclear force They are a family of particles that are different from the other known family of fermions the quarks

Electrons are a well known example that are found in ordinary matter There are six leptons the electron muon and tau particles and their associated neutrinos The different varieties of the elementary particles are commonly called flavors and the neutrinos here are considered to have distinctly different flavor Of the six leptons three have electrical charge and three do not The best known charged lepton is the electron The other two charged leptons are the muon and the tau which are like electrons but much bigger The charged leptons are all negative 

The superparticle of a lepton is called a slepton

Jersey is an island off the northwest coast of France It is a crown dependency of the British monarchy The territory of Jersey is called a bailiwick because the person who is head of the island is called the Bailiff The Bailiwick of Jersey also includes the islands of the Minquiers and Ecrhous where nobody lives The other islands of the Channel Islands belong to the Bailiwick of Guernsey The country code is JE

Over eighty eight thousand people live on the main island Thirty per cent of them live in its only town Saint Helier

Along with English and French more than two thousand people speak Jrriais a dialectal form of the Norman language

The Bailiwick of Jersey is not a part of the United Kingdom or of the European Union It has its own parliament called the States of Jersey which passes laws for the island

Jersey is divided into 12 parishes which elect their own administration

The Democratic Republic of East Timor or Timor Leste is a country in Southeast Asia It is on the eastern side of the island of Timor and also the smaller islands of Atauro and Jaco and a small area named Oecussi Ambeno inside the west side of Timor That area is an exclave which means it is separated from the main part of the country by part of another country That other country is Indonesia

The capital and largest city Dili is home to one hundred and fifty thousand people

The next largest city is Baucau

East Timor gets its name from the Malay word for east timur

For a long time a European country called Portugal controlled the East Timor and called it The Colony of Portuguese Timor In 1975 the Portuguese army left and East Timor was invaded by the Indonesian army in 1975 The invasion was very violent The army stayed there until 1999 when they gave up control of the territory with the help of the United Nations

At the time the United States government said it did not know Indonesia was going to invade East Timor But secret documents released from 2002 to 2005 show that Henry Kissinger the Secretary of State of the United States did know and supported the invasion

When it got its independence on May 20 2002 it became the first country to become independent in the twenty first century In 2006 when Montenegro became independent East Timor was no longer the newest one

Since then East Timor has not been given much attention in the news Recently the Colombian music artist Shakira made a song named Timor which talks about the country The attention is because there has been fighting in East Timor between gangs security forces Australia a large nearby country sent troops in to make peace

HISTORY

East Timor is a small country located between Australia and Indonesia Before Christ 3000 years ago East Timor was a mountainous island composed of migrant indigenous people from New Guinea Australia and Melanesia 

There were some migrants from Austronesia searching for a new life on this island on developed their skills in areas like Agriculture to develop Some of the people arrived from South China and North Indochina looking for trade because East Timor had enough resources to explore and export like sandalwood honey slaves and wax 

During the Second War World the Japanese occupied the region encountered strong resistance to their attempts to force the population to grow foods for their troops and export At the time 30 of the population died

On April 25th 1974 the Portuguese Armed Forces headed by General Antnio de Spnola organized a Military Coup against SALAZARs Regime called the Revolution of Carnations Since this Revolution Portugal decided to give freedom to the colonized countries

IDD is an abbreviation that could mean

Density is a measurement that compares the amount ratio of matter an object has to its volume An object with a lot of matter in a certain amount of volume has high density An object with a little matter in the same amount of volume has a low density

Temperature has an effect on density When the temperature of a substance increasesthe density decreases When the temperature of a substance of a substance decreases the density increases Many substances follow this rule but there are exceptions Water is one such exception Fresh water is the only liquid with a density of 1

The most common SI units for density are gcm3 and kgm3 When the numerator is much larger than the denominator that means the substance has a higher density When the denominator is much larger than the numerator the substance has a lower density 

Sometimes scientists use the idea of density to talk about other properties instead of mass Theyre trying to describe how much of a property can be found in a specific piece of what they are looking at For example population density is how many people live within the same amount of space The population density in the city is higher than the country side because there are more people living closer to each other in the city In computers storage density is how much data can fit on disks in relation to their physical size A blu ray disc has a higher storage density than a DVD which has a higher storage density a CD even though they all have almost exactly the same volume

A gram is a unit of measure part of the metric system It measures mass or how much matter is in somethingThe symbol g often means the gram

One gram used to be defined as the mass of one cubic centimeter of pure water at 398 degrees Celsius Now one gram is defined as 11000 kilogram

Longitude is a way to say where a place is on the Earth It is measured starting from an imaginary north south line called the Prime Meridian Longitude says how far east or west of the Prime Meridian any place is

Longitude is measured using degrees the same way an angle is The Prime Meridian is 0 and the farthest away is 180 eastward and 180 westward Unlike latitude which has the equator as a natural starting position there is no natural starting position for longitude Other meridians have been used in the past but most scientists now agree to use the Prime Meridian

Longitude as opposed to latitude does not maintain a constant distance between degrees since the primary measurement is time not distance This means if you are near the North Pole you can gain many degrees of longitude West by travelling a relatively short distance

An oil platform is a large structure placed in the sea It is used to drill for oil or natural gas at the bottom of the sea The platform may be attached to the sea flooror it might be movable

In general oil platforms are located on the continental shelf As of 2006 drilling for resources up to 8km away from the platform was possible

A continental shelf is the part of the continent that is under water The shelf was part of the land during the ice ages in the glacial periods but under water in the interglacial periods We are at present in an interglacial period

Every continent is in the sea like an island Most of the island is above the water line and we see it as a continent Some of it though is below the water line Beyond the continental shelf the bottom goes down to much greater depths

The continental shelf is a shallow ocean It varies in depth up to 140 metres deep It varies greatly in its width At the leading edge of a moving continental plate there will be little or no shelf The western edge of the Americas are an example The shelf on a passive edge of a plate will be wide and shallow The widest shelf is the Siberian shelf in the Arctic Ocean it is 1500km in width

There have been at some periods shallow seas inside continents These are called epicontinental seas Much of present day North America was covered by an epicontinental sea called the Sundance Sea during the Jurassic period In the Cretaceous an even larger area was covered by the Western Interior Seaway

Continental seas have the richest life of the oceans more species and greater numbers than anywhere else This is because it has both sunlight and nutrients for photosynthesis This causes microscopic algae and cyanobacteria to bloom and then animals eat the phytoplankton Most of the nutrients in the oceans are washed down from the continents by rivers In particular the continents are almost the only source for some key elements such as iron The lack of nutrients away from continents explains why so much of the Pacific Ocean is almost barren of life and why the shelves are so rich in life

The shelf usually ends at a point of decreasing slope The sea floor below the break is the continental slope The character of the shelf changes dramatically at the shelf break where the continental slope begins With a few exceptions the shelf break is located at a remarkably uniform depth of roughly convert140mftabbronlkoff this is likely a hallmark of past ice ages when sea level was lower than it is nowp43

The Mariana Trench is the deepest known submarine trench It is also the deepest known location on Earth itself It is next to the Mariana Islands and has a depth up to 10971 m The trench is near Guam

The trench is about 2550 kilometres long but has a mean width of only 69 kilometres

The deepest part of the trench is known as the Challenger Deep It is named after the British Royal Navy survey ship HMS Challenger whose expedition of 187276 made the first recordings of its depth

The most recent sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep from the Kilo Moana has found a spot with a depth of convert10971m0abbron The sonar system has an accuracy of better than 02 of water depth

The Challenger Deep has been reached three times by submersibles namely the manned bathyscaphe Trieste on 23 January 1960 and the unmanned robotic deep sea probes Kaiko in 1995 and the Nereus in 2009

The HMS Challenger expedition found radiolaria in the two dredged samples taken when the Challenger Deep was first discovered 

On their 1960 descent the crew of the Trieste noted that the floor consisted of diatomaceous ooze and reported observing some type of flatfish resembling a sole about 1 foot long and 6 inches across lying on the seabed The report has since been questioned with suggestions that it may have been a sea cucumber The video camera on board the Kaiko probe spotted a sea cucumber a scale worm and a shrimp at the bottom At the bottom of the Challenger deep the Nereus probe spotted one polychaete worm about an inch long

An analysis of the sediment samples collected by Kaiko found large numbers of simple organisms at convert10900mftabbron 

The overwhelming majority of the organisms collected were simple soft shelled foraminifera 

Eighty five percent of the specimens were organic soft shelled forams This is unusual compared to samples of sediment from other deep sea environments where the percentage of organic walled foraminifera ranges from 5 to 20 As small organisms with hard calcareous shells have trouble growing at extreme depths because of the high solubility of calcium carbonate in the pressurized water scientists theorize that the preponderance of soft shelled organisms in the Challenger Deep may have resulted from survivors of the biosphere present when the Challenger Deep was shallower than it is now 

The trench is one of the results of a large boundary where two oceanic tectonic plates have converged

At the boundary the western edge of the Pacific Plate is subducted beneath the small Mariana Plate Because the Pacific plate is the largest of all the tectonic plates on Earth crustal material at its western edge has had up to 170 million years to compact and become very dense hence its great height difference relative to the higher riding Mariana Plate at the point where the Pacific Plate crust is subducted This deep area is the Mariana trench proper The movement of these plates is also responsible for the formation of the Mariana Islands

The Mariana Islands are a group of islands made up by the summits of 15 volcanic mountains in the western Pacific Ocean 

They are the southern part of a submerged mountain range that goes on for 1565 miles from Guam to near Japan The Marianas are the northernmost islands of a larger island group called Micronesia The Marianas have a total land area of 396 square miles and are composed of two administrative units

The first European to discover the island group was Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 In 1667 Spain formally claimed them and named them after Spanish Queen Mariana of Austria

Torture is when someone puts another person in pain This pain may be physical or psychological People who have been tortured often suffer from long term physical problems or mental health issues 

The person who is tortured is usually tortured because he or she has some information the other people want Torture has in the past also served as a punishment In 1600 Anton Praetorius fought against torture and against the hunting of witches 

Almost all countries agree that torture is a violation of human rights This has been stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights It is more difficult for people to agree what things are torture and what things are okay to do to prisoners

Torture is a crime in many countries and it was made against the law on December 10th 1948

There is a radio station and a meteorological station on the island The staff at these stations are the only people living on the island

There are many claims and stories about discovery of the island Some claims and possible discoveries are as early as the beginning of the 6th century However the first discovery that is certain was in 1614 The Dutchman Jan Jacobs May van Schellinkhout visited the island then and it is named for him His first mate made maps of some of the coast

It is incorrectly assumed that Henry Hudson discovered the island in 1607 and called it Hudsons Tutches or Touches but there is no evidence for this Thereafter it was allegedly seen several times by navigators who claimed its discovery and renamed it Thus in 1611 or the following year whalers from Hull named it Trinity Island in 1612 Jean Vrolicq a French whaler claimed in 1629 that he had discovered the island and called it le de Richelieu and in 1614 English captain John Clarke named it Isabella cndateDecember 2011

The island has very few residents The Long Range Navigation base has a staff of 14 and a weather services station has a staff of four The staff members of both stations live in Olonkinbyen The island has no native people living on it but is given the ISO 3166 1 country code SJ the Internet country code top level domain no and data code JN Its amateur radio call sign prefix is JX

Atomic mass is a term for the mass of a single atom of a chemical element It includes the weights of the 3 subatomic particles that make up an atom protons electrons and neutrons

Because the electron is so light the atomic mass is frequently expressed as the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom So for example Carbon 14 has 14 particles that are either protons or neutrons and the mass can be worked out from their charge

There are different definitions of price Perhaps the simplest definition is to say that the price is the value of a good or service expressed in another good or service

Lets say Peter raises sheep Sally raises ducks Winter is coming so Sally wants some sheepskin coat to make her feel warm She could now first calculate how much sheepskin she would need for a coat Lets say she needs 2 sheep skins for that coat She would then go to Peter and ask him how much he wants for the two sheep skins she needs Peter would then likely tell a price Alternatively Sally could trade some of her ducks for the sheepskins

Since trading ducks for sheep is rather complicated people introduced something they called money This is simply used for trading So Sally would trade some of her ducks for money Some of this money she could then give to Peter to get the sheepskin 

Doping is either a term to describe drug use or the process of putting certain types of chemical elements in a semiconductor in order to make their characteristics different

In the field of electronics doping is when an impurity is added to a semiconductor This is done to create things that make electricity go in one direction or to make semiconductor switches This allows for computers to exist 

When a element called Boron is added to silicon the Boron dopant is called an acceptor because it likes accepting electrons

When a chemical called Phosphorous is added to silicon the Phosphorous is called a donor because it does not like electrons

When referring to everyday drug use doping can be considered an old term and is not found in common usage Some would say it is a 50s term much like going steady But the use of illegal drugs to help a sportsperson do better is still called doping it is not an old fashioned term in sports

Doping often refers to Marijuana usage as a common alternate name for Marijuana is dope The word referring to drug use was probably derived from dope which means someone who is stupid

The Gaza Strip is a stretch of land along the Mediterranean The main city in the Gaza Strip is called Gaza At the beginning of 2006 the strip is not part of any recognized country It is currently ruled by Hamas

It is one of the most densely populated areas on Earth About 15 million people live on a surface of roughly 493 km

Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 and gave over the territory to Palestinian administration Meanwhile Hamas the Palestinian group which controls the territory has launched rockets at Israel Israel has fought back and bombed Gaza most recently during December of 2008

Most inhabitants are related to the Arabs displaced from their homes during the Israel War of Independence in 1948 They live in cities which they call refugee camps The main problems facing the area are war unemployment poverty and malnutrition In 2010 a large shopping mall opened in Gaza

Unemployment is when a person who is of normal working age does not have a paid job They therefore do not get paid a salary In some parts of the world there are social networks to care for the unemployed

The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people divided by the total population of that age group of a country The unemployment rate is influenced by many things including the government of a country to the average age of a countrys population

A certain amount of unemployment is natural Full employment does not mean no one is out of work Governments now aim to increase the number of jobs rather than cut out all unemployment

A salary is a type of payment a person gets for work done for a job A salary is usually paid for a fixed period of time like a month or a week The other possibly one time payment for work done is called wage or fee

In physics magnetism is a force that can attract or repel things that have a magnetic material like iron inside them

Magnetism can be made by things we call magnets or can also be made by electricity in a wire Magnetic attraction is when magnets are put near to magnetic objects the magnet will attract the magnetic object and pull it towards the magnet until it is as near as it can get or touching it Magnets can also repel other magnets Most objects that are attracted to magnets have iron in them Most other metals such as aluminium are not attracted to magnets 

Magnets have an unseen area around them called a magnetic field Magnetic objects inside this unseen field are attracted to the magnet Magnetic things outside the magnetic field are not attracted to the magnet This is why a magnet must be close to an object to attract it

The ends of a magnet are called magnetic poles This is the part of magnets that attract magnetic things the most All magnets have what is called a magnetic north pole and what is called a magnetic south pole If a piece of string is tied to the middle of the magnet and the string is held so that the magnet is allowed to hang down on its own then the north pole of the magnet will turn and point to the Earths magnetic north pole This can be tested by tying a string to a magnet shaped like a straight stick and then holding the string so that the magnet can turn 

The poles of two magnets will repel or attract each other Different poles attract each other For example if the south pole of one magnet is put near the south pole of another magnet the magnets will repel each other This will also happen with two north poles that are put near each other If a north pole is put near a south pole the magnets will attract each other until they stick to each other and can be hard to pull apart

Magnets have many uses One use was found long ago when explorers found that a magnet could be used as a compass to show the direction of north south

Electromagnets are another kind of magnet They only work when electricity is running through them Often these magnets work by using a coil of wire that makes a magnetic field when there is a current in it In addition to this coil of wire a large piece of metal usually iron is placed inside the coil to increase the magnetic field made Though most large electromagnets employ many solenoids to lift heavy objects smaller solenoids are used in everyday electronics For example they are used to change voltage in a transformer Electromagnets can also be used to make electricity Movement of a magnet back and forth in front of the electromagnet will make an electric current

Electromagnets are used to make many things work like computers televisions and radios

The effect of magnetism on global warming has not yet been researched It is believed that severe climate change can also change the Earths magnetism This it has not been found to be true yet Earth does change its magnetic poles every million years Before a change of magnetic field the Earths magnetic field becomes weaker and moves around like a top would before it falls The earth has already had hundreds of changes Scientists know this as a result of studies of the sea floor near the mid Atlantic ridge The lava slowly moves out of this crevasse and then it cools with its iron molecules all pointing in the new direction of the Earths magnetic field We can look at the history of this magnetic field today to look back at the many flips in the past

The Althing is the national legislature of Iceland It was founded in 930 at ingvellir which is almost 45 kilometers east of Icelands capital Reykjavk When the Althing was formed that was the beginning of Iceland as a country Even after Icelands union with Norway the Althing still held its meetings at ingvellir until 1799 when it was stopped for several years It started meeting again in 1844 and moved to Reykjavk where it has been ever since The parliament building where the Althing meets now is called the Alingishs It was built with Icelandic stone in 1881

Because the Althing was founded more than one thousand years ago Iceland is one of the worlds oldest democratic countries

A character role in a play means one of the people in the play who have a particular character They contrast with the main characters of the play For example there may be two lovers who are the main characters of the story The character roles might be a wicked step mother a kind nurse an old wise man a stupid fool a servant who is very old etc

The blues is a form of music that started in the United States during the start of the 20th century It was started by former African slaves from spirituals praise songs and chants The first blues songs were called Delta blues These songs came from the area near the mouth of the Mississippi River Many afro Americans migrated to the north esp in the northwest of the United States to find work They took the blues with them and developed it into new styles The most important is the Chicago Blues which is played with electric amplified instruments But also in other cities and states a own form of Blues developed from the Delta Blues

Blues is based around a very simple patternand so is twi Blues is easy to play but hard to feel Jimi Hendrix A common form for the blues is a repeating 12 bar form This is put together as 3 phrases or sections each being 4 bars long The basic blues only needs 3 chords one based on the first note of the scale  the tonic chord one based on the fourth note of the scale  the subdominant chord and one based on the fifth note of the scale  the dominant chord The first section or phrase of 4 bars only uses the tonic chord A common variation is to use the subdominant chord in the second bar The second phrase has 2 bars of subdominant chord then 2 bars of tonic chord The third phrase has 1 bar of dominant chord 1 bar of subdominant chord and finishes with 2 bars of tonic chord

In a scale based on the note C the chord pattern of a 12 bar blues would be like this

C C C C C C C C or F F F F C C C C C C C C 

F F F F F F F F C C C C C C C C 

G G G G F F F F C C C C C C C C 

The melody of the simplest blues scales are based on the broken wikt linkminor pentatonicminor pentatonic scale for example C Eflat G A Bflat C with extra notes added like this C Eflat Gflat G A Bflat C Blue notes do not normally fit a scale but they give the music a special feeling

The lyricsare usually about life the bad things in life They are to simple blues songs are also based around the form of 3 phrases The first phrase is set over the first 4 bars of music The second phrase words are a repetition of the first phrase this always happens and emphasises the message The third phrase completes the story and rhymes as the first line This verse from Robert Johnsons Crossroad Blues shows how these phrases work in a song

I went to the crossroads fell down on my knees I went to the crossroads fell down on my knees Asked the Lord above have mercy now save poor Bob if you please

Macroeconomics studies the economic decisions of a large group of people for example a whole countrys economy Many governments use macroeconomics to decide how much tax to collect and what interest rates should be

Macroeconomics also looks at exchange rates For example if a country has a high exchange rate not many people will want to buy its expensive products So the demand will be lower and so will the prices

Game theory uses math to study strategy Game theory studies more than just board games sports and games of luck It also studies things like business and military decisions In game theory people call all of these situations games In other words you can use game theory to study any situation where more than one person makes choices 

The players in a game are not even always people Players can be people companies armies or other things Each player wants something maybe a company wants to make as much money as it can or a country wants to win a war Sometimes the players work together but often they are competing against each other

Game theory is part of economics

One important game is the prisoners dilemma Its an imaginary situation that shows why sometimes people do not cooperate

Imagine this situation the police catch two criminals after they committed a crime The police do not know which person committed the crime and which person just helped They question the two in separate cells Each prisoner can either stay silent or betray the other by blaming the crime on them If both stay silent they only go to jail for 6 months If one betrays and the other stays silent the one that stays silent goes to jail for 10 years and the other one does not go to jail at all If they both betray each other they each go to jail for 2 years No matter what happens the prisoners will never see each other again

If you are a prisoner in this situation and you only care about yourself the way to get the smallest sentence is to betray the other prisoner No matter what you get a shorter sentence when you betray than when you do not If the other prisoner stays silent and does not betray then betraying means you do not go to jail at all instead of going to jail for 6 months If the other prisoner betrays then betraying lets you go to jail for 2 years instead of 10 years In other words its always best for you to betray even though the two of you would be better off if you both stayed silent It is said that betraying the other prisoner is your dominant strategy because it is always the best thing for you to do no matter what the other prisoner does

The prisoners dilemma is like a lot of other situations in the real world For example if two countries are trying to decide whether to make new weapons they are both better off if neither country does But sometimes the countries are in the same situation as the prisoners each country only cares about itself and its better off if it betrays the other country by making weapons

The prisoners dilemma does not have same result if some of the details are different If the prisoners can talk with each other and plan for the future they might both decide to cooperate because they hope that will make the other country help them in the future In game theory this is called a repeated game If the players are altruistic they might be OK with going to jail so they can help the other person

The Taj Mahal is a tomb built in the 17th century by Mughal ruler Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal 

It is in the city of Agra Uttar Pradesh Republic of India Widely thought of as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world it is one of Indias biggest tourist attractions 

It was chosen as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2007 It is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site together with the Agra Fort 25 kilometers away 

The Taj Mahal is an example of Mughal architecture a mixture of building design ideas from Islamic Indian Persian and Muslim arts 

Shah Jahan was going to build an identical black tomb for himself but he died before he even began to build and was entombed in the Taj Mahal with his wife

The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over the world and over 10000 people were used to move building materials It is generally thought that Uhmad Ahmad Lahauri was in charge of the construction The construction was finished in 1653

Many people think it is one of the most beautiful buildings ever built However it is slowly being damaged by acid rain A nearby oil refinery has been blamed for some of the damage In 1996 the Indian Supreme Court said that local industry was harming the Taj Mahal The court set up an area of 10400 square kilometers around the Taj Mahal called the Taj Trapezium Zone Industries within this zone must use natural gas instead of coal

There have also been concerns about the effect of visitors on the site Rajan Kishore a conservationist from Agra has said that visitors walking through are putting too much pressure on the Taj Mahal and suggested that the number of people allowed in be limited

Aryan is the name that an ancient people of Europe Iran and India called themselves Descendants of the Aryans include speakers of Sanskrit and Avestan which are related to the Indo European languages About three thousand and five hundred years ago both Iranians and Indians used the name Aryan to mean their shared ancestors as well as nobles 

The Avestan name Airiianm va Aryan expanse is a reference in the Zoroastrian Avesta to the Aryans mother country and one of Ahura Mazdas sixteen perfect lands Other Avestan names are airyayana the Aryan people and airy daihv the Aryan lands These names were known to old Greek writers as Ariana Also the Sanskrit name ryvarta abode of the Aryans was a region in north of todays India The Middle Persian name of the Sassanian Empire an empire that ruled Persia from the 3rd century to the 7th century was Eran shar meaning the Aryan Empire  Today the name Iran is simply the Persian word for Aryan

In the late 18th century Europeans began using the term Aryan to refer to the original prehistoric Proto Indo Europeans and their descendents up to the present day This was the most common definition of Aryan in the 19th century and early 20th century This was the definition used by HG Wells in his best selling 1920 book The Outline of History Many young people consider this definition obsolete and politically incorrect but it is still used by some older people such as in a 1989 article in Scientific American by Colin Renfrew advocating the Anatolian hypothesis in which he uses the word Aryan in its traditional meaning as a synonym for Indo European 

In the late 19th century some Europeans began to use the name Aryan for only the Nordic peoples of Europe as a pure noble and superior race they claimed were descended from the original Aryans

The theory that the Aryans first came from Europe became especially accepted in Germany It was widely believed that the Vedic Aryans were the same people as the Goths Vandals and other ancient Germanic peoples who brought the Western Roman Empire to an end This idea was often mixed with anti Semitic ideas The Master Race theory became a main idea for Nazis After the Nazis took power in Germany in 1933 these ideas led to horrible persecutions of the Jews which culminated in the Holocaust

The idea of racism that the Nazi theory means has been totally put aside by modern scientists some of whom also disagree with the idea that the original Aryans ever lived in Europe Most other scientists do maintain that the original Proto Indo Europeans did live about 5000 years ago in the area in Europe east of Ukraine and north of the Caucasus Mountains and that the original Aryans did migrate east to Iran and India from there and the original ancestors of the modern European peoples did migrate west from there This is called the Kurgan hypothesis

The belief in witchcraft is in many cultures worldwide Witches have often been seen outside accepted cultures and faith As a consequences people often made witches feel unwanted in their societies 

In the Bible the punishment for witchcraft is death Witch in the Bible means summoner of spirits so it might really mean warlock In Europe in the early modern period broken wikt linkpersecutionpersecution of witches took place Many Christians were scared of witches and witchcraft at that time As a result about sixty thousand people Citation neededdateJanuary 2012 were tried for witchcraft and executed Most were hanged Some were burned at the stake Especially in the early modern period this punishment was often applied

The Salem trials were among these trials Gilles Corey was one of the people accused of witchcraft Because he knew that he had done no wrong Corey simply refused to speak He was pressed to death 

Women were burned at the stake for simply sweeping their porches on Sundays Citation neededdateJanuary 2012 or putting herbs in a soup 

Among those punished were people who did not live peacefully with their rulers like Joan of Arc Queen Anne Boleyn was accused of being a witch and was said to have had a large mole on her neck and a sixth finger though this was likely invented by her ennemies 

There were some men who protested against torture and against the chase of witches

During the early Modern Age the Church developed a whole set of teachings and beliefs about witches These beliefs were centered around the following

People believed that a witch had certain things that clearly identified her as a witch Some of these were

People believed that witches had a pact with the devil The diabolical mark was a token left on the skin of the witch 

Most of the time this was believed to be a mole or birthmark It was said that since this was a sign of the devil touching it would not hurt the person People also though that this mark could not bleed

This soon developed into a safe test for witchcraft Most often special techniques were used by those doing the test so that the pricked spot would not bleed or hurt Some needles were also found that were special When touching the skin the needle would go into its shaft In that way it could not be felt and did of course not bleed Many innocent people were wrongfully convicted because of this test

In the 20th century a new attempt has been made at understanding witchcraft Many people say that witches were in fact wise women who were hunted down by the church This has led to a new movement Some of it is known as Wicca Some of it is known as Shamanism Often women understand this as a way to express themselves Sometimes feminists have also spoken about it Some of the rites have also been used as a form of protest

All of the following persons were real people

The West Bank is a piece of land in the Middle East It touches the Dead Sea and the River Jordan The lanscape is mostly hills or desert The weather in the summer is hot and dry it is cooler and rainy in the winter Right now the area is under the control of Israel Some Israelis and other nations disagree on whose it really is

Right now talks between the Israeli government and the Palestinian National Authority which leads Palestine are taking place These talks are about what will happen in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the future Most people on the West Bank are Palestinians but there also many Jewish settlers in settlements There has been some controversy about these settlements

Jan HusJohn Huss born circa 1369 in Husinec Bohemia was a Bohemian religious thinker and reformer He started a religious movement based on the ideas of John Wyclif His followers became known as Hussites The Roman Catholic Church has not tolerated such heresies Hus was excommunicated in 1411 condemned by the Council of Constance and burned at the stake on July 6 1415 in Konstanz Germany

Many of his teachings were later taken up by Martin Luther who also published some of the things he wrote in prison 

Konstanz is a university town with a population of around 80000 on the shore of Lake Constance in the south west corner of Germany bordering Switzerland The history of the city goes back to Ancient Rome In the 15th century the Council of Constance was held there This ended the Western Schism Jan Hus was burned as a heretic at the council

Instant messaging is a form of communication between two or more people based on typed text The text is delivered via computers connected over a network such as the Internet

Instant messaging requires an instant messaging client that connects to an instant messaging service Instant messaging is different from e mail in that conversations happen in real time A multiprotocol instant messaging application allows one client to connect to multiple IM networks

America Online is a US based online service provider and Internet service provider It has been in business since 1985

AOL Instant Messenger is a service which allows to communicate with any user currently online AIM has millions of users worldwide There are also other computer programs that can be used to talk with your AIM account for example Trillian Pidgin Digsby and AIM 

Other AOL products are AOL Spyware Protection AOL Safety and Security Center ICQ AOl Computer Check Up AOL ExplorerAOL TopSpeed AOL Dialer AOL One Click Fixes and AOL Openride

A mailman or mail carrier is a person who brings people their postal mail Normally he works for the post office of the respective country Of course there are also women doing this job They are called mailwomen For a layman this occupation is called letter carriers 

Mailmen are traditionally shown as acting unusually relating mainly to dogs They are deathly afraid of the animals even to the point of shock

The Chinese postman problem is a mathematical problem of Graph theory It is also known as route inspection problem Suppose there is a mailman who needs to deliver mail to a certain neighborhood That mailman is lazy so he wants to find the shortest route through the neighborhood that meets the following criteria

If the graph traveled has an Eulerian Circuit this circuit is the ideal solution

Alan Goldman of the US National Bureau of Standards first coined the name Chinese Postman Problem for this problem as it was originally studied by the Chinese mathematician Mei Ku Kuan in 1962

The four color theorem is a theorem of mathematics It says that in any plane surface with regions in it the regions can be colored with no more than four colors Two regions that have a common border must not get the same color They are called adjacent if they share a segment of the border not just a point

This was the first theorem to be proved by a computer in a proof by exhaustion In proof by exhaustion the conclusion is established by dividing it into cases and proving each one separately The number of cases sometimes may be very large For example the first proof of the four color theorem was a proof by exhaustion with 1936 cases This proof was controversial because most of the cases were checked by a computer program not by hand The shortest known proof of the four colour theorem today still has over 600 cases

It is quite obvious that there are maps that cannot be colored in this way with only three colors On the other hand four colors are enough for every map

A theorem is a proven idea in mathematics Theorems are proved using logic and other theorems that have already been proved A theorem that someone must prove so that heshe can prove another theorem is called a lemma Theorems are made of two parts there are hypotheses and conclusions 

Theorems use deduction in contrast to theories which are empirical

Some theorems are trivial they directly follow from the propositions Other theorems are called deep their proof is long and difficult Sometimes such proofs involve other areas of matematics or show connections between different areas A theorem might be simple to state and yet be deep An excellent example is Fermats Last Theorem and there are many other examples of simple yet deep theorems in number theory and combinatorics among other areas 

There are other theorems for which a proof is known but it cannot easily be written down Among the best examples are the four color theorem and the Kepler conjecture Both of these theorems are only known to be true by reducing them to a computational search which is then verified by a computer program At first many mathematicians did not accept this form of proof but it has become more widely accepted in recent years The mathematician Doron Zeilberger has even gone so far as to claim that these are possibly the only nontrivial results that mathematicians have ever proved Many mathematical theorems can be reduced to more straightforward computation including polynomial identities trigonometric identities and hypergeometric identities

Triceratops was a herbivorous dinosaur genus from the latest Cretaceous Its name came from having three horns on their they They were mainly found in North America They were about 9 m long and probably weighed around 5400 kg

The Border between two regions is the thin line where one region is next to the other If the regions are countries the border can only be crossed at certain points To cross the border a passport or a visa might be necessary Such as the Wagah boder between Pakistan and the Republic of India

A Genus is a group of living things that are similar Grouping creatures in a scientific way is a kind of taxonomy When scientists talk about one genus of animals or plants they mean several species of those animals or plants that are closely related to each other

The word changes differently from other English words because it comes from Latin Genus is the singular for only one group and genera is the plural form of the word for two or more groups Several genera make up a family 

When writing a scientific name of an organism you need to write the name with the genus in front For example Felis silvestris catus Felis is the genus The genus must always begin with a capital letter

Some people use a special rhyme or sentence called a mnemonic to help remember something difficult like a list In one mnemonic to remember biological taxonomy genus is the word glass Here is one example Kings play chess on folding glass stools to remember Kingdom phylum class order family genus species

The Cretaceous period is the longest period in the Phanerozoic eon lasting from 145 to 65 million years ago a total of 80 million years It is the last period in the Mesozoic era It followed the Jurassic period and was followed by the Cainozoic era 

Though famous for its land fauna the Cretaceous sea level rose much higher than today so that North America was partly covered by an epicontinental sea and half of Britain was under water In the Upper Cretaceous chalk a type of limestone was laid down in warm shallow seas Chalk is 95 to 99 made up of coccoliths the calcium carbonate plates which tiny single celled algae produce

At its end came the famous meteorite strike which with the volcanic flood basalts spewed out in the Deccan ended so many of the dominant life forms see KT extinction event

The Cretaceous period has just two very long epochs

The Lower Cretaceous at 47 million years is the longest epoch in the Phanerozoic eon

A whole number usually means an ordinary number like 0 1 2 3 4 5 and so on Fractions decimals and negative numbers are not whole numbers

What is confusing is that some people say that zero is not a whole number And some people say that negative numbers are whole numbers So the real answer to what is a whole number is that it depends on which book you are reading or which teacher you have That is why some people say non negative integers instead of whole numbers so everybody will know that they are including zero and not including negative numbers

A textbook is a book someone uses to learn It is usually supplied in classrooms form primary school to post secondary school People use it to learn from it about a certain subject They might also teach other people about that subject

A workbook is a form of textbook but it allows the person to do exercises and practices on it

An Axiom is a statement of logic that is not proved within the discussion of a problem 

Logic can be used to deduce other theorems from the axioms

Euclid of Alexandria was a Greek mathematician Around the year 300BC he made a list of axioms

When philosophers speak about paradigms or theolgians about dogmas they mean similar things

A set is an idea from mathematics A set can hold zero or more things A set cannot hold a particular item more than once either that item is in the set or it is not Multisets or bags are like sets in quite a few ways but can hold a certain type of item more than once

Most mathematicians use uppercase italic letters to write about sets The things that are seen as elements of sets are usually written with lowercase Roman letters

Usually when things are put into a bag all the things that are put in have something in common If someone else needs to get the same set there are different options on how to tell them

Like a bag a set can also be empty The empty set is like an empty bag it has no things in it

Sometimes cardinality is not a number Sometimes a set has infinite cardinality The set of integers is a set with infinite cardinality Some sets with infinite cardinality are bigger than others There are more real numbers than there are natural numbers for example That means we cannot pair up the set of integers and the set of real numbers even if we worked forever If a set has the same cardinality as the set of integers it is called a countable set But if a set has the same cardinality as the real numbers it is called an uncountable set

Example Every Chevrolet is an American car So the set of all Chevrolets is contained in the set of all American cars

A mathematician called Bertrand Russell found that there are problems with this theory of sets He stated this in a paradox called Russells paradox An easier to understand version closer to real life is called the Barber paradox

There is a small town somewhere In that town there is a barber All the men in the town do not like beards so they either shave themselves or they go to the barber shop to be shaved by the barber

We can therefore make a statement about the barber himself The barber shaves all men that do not shave themselves He only shaves those men

This of course raises the question What does the barber do each morning to look clean shaven This is the paradox

The following are books about sets They may not be easy to read though

The Maldives are a group of islands in the Indian Ocean They are southwest of India They are made up of the Maldive and Suadive archipelagos with over 1200 islands These islands are a part of 26 atolls People live on about 200 of the islands It has more than 1126 coral reefs It is the flattest country in the world The highest point in the Maldives is only convert2mft0lkonabbron high above the level of the sea

Mal is the capital with a population of 81000 people The main language spoken there is Dhivehi There are many dialects such as Addu

The Prime Minister of Australia is the leader of the Australian government He or she has the most powerful political office in the Commonwealth of Australia

The current Prime Minister of Australia since 24 June 2010 is Julia Gillard who is the first woman in the post after Kevin Rudd resigned from office

 Structure is a fundamental concept of the modern science which means arrangement of parts of organs or of constituent particles in a substance or body

A structure may refer to buildings machines and similar things made by people as well as to a rock or a mineral atoms or sentences

Hardcore punk is a style of punk music that usually sounds louder faster and more angry than earlier punk rock music from the 1970s Hardcore began in the 1980s in North America Some of the important bands of the genre are Bad Brains Black Flag DOA Minor Threat Cro Mags and other important youth crew and hardcore bands such as Gorilla Biscuits and Youth Of Today Hardcore songs often have more political lyrics than songs from 1970s punk rock

Hardcore band singers often sing by shouting the words of the song Hardcore songs often sound like the singer is angry Hardcore bands use electric guitars electric bass guitar drums and a singer The electric guitars in hardcore bands are distorted and noisy because the people in the band have changed the guitar strings so they play notes that are lower than those a normal guitar can play

Limestone is a chemical sedimentary rock made up mostly of the mineral calcite When it is heated at a very high temperature it becomes the metamorphic rock marble They are fairly dense relatively easy to cut or be shaped into blocks and some forms are white in color 

Limestone is easy to work with so it is used for building and the bases of roads Limestone became most popular in the 19th and 20th centuries for building things such as churches banks and houses It is used to make glass and cement It can be used like chalk as it is mostly calcium so you can actually draw with the stone People use it as decorations sometimes as pebbles It is also used to make iron in a blast furnace to remove impurities from the iron ore

The roots of a plant is the part that is usually buried in the soil Roots are not always under the soil thoughsometimes roots can be above the ground This is called an aerial root 

Also stems can sometimes be under the soil Roots do not have leaves and are different from stems inside

Plants need their roots especially for three reasons The roots take water and nutrients a sort of food from the soil They also often store this food And they fix the plants to the ground 

However most plant roots do not work at their best unless they have help from fungi The symbiosis between roots and fungus is known as mycorrhiza

There are two sorts of root systems

Some roots go very deep into the ground One root that was found in Arizona USA was 60 m below the surface

Roots are also very strong Some tree roots can destroy stonesRoots are not green because the cells have no chlorophyll

Roots grow through the whole life of the plant They grow longer from the tip adding cells to the end of each root The root adds cells to their tips and they grow fatter as they add cells around their tube like bodies

At the tip of each root there is a small group of tough dead hard cells called the root cap The root cap is the strongest part of the root tip and its job is to push its way through the dirt to look for moisture and nutrients and protect the plant

Roots are usually found underground but in some cases this is not so In the rainforest the air is warm and humid Some rainforest plants known as epiphytes grow right on trees Their roots hang down in the air or running into the moss growing on the trees They do not even need the soil they have all they need floating around in the air or in the moss

Some trees have roots that are above the ground and underground Mangrove trees have aerial roots They exchange gases with the atmosphere just as leaves do They are an adaptation to the poor level of oxygen in the waterlogged soil of the mangrove swamp

The banyan tree has a root system that is underground but it also has roots that start in its branches and grow down towards the ground These roots not only take in water and nutrients from the soil but they also help to support the long branches of the banyan tree Because of this extra support banyan tree branches can be really long A banyantree in Lahaina Maui which was planted in 1873 by a man named William Owen Smith has branches that are so long that this single tree covers a full square block in the city

There are two main kinds of roots systems taproot systems and fibrous root systems A taproot system has one thick main root growing down from the plants stem and lots of smaller secondary roots branching off from this A taproot system is usually deeper than it is wide Often we eat taproots like carrots and turnips

A fibrous root system has lots of roots growing in many directions There is not one main root A fibrous root system is usually wider than deep

Demo may mean one of the following

Piero Gobetti was a young journalist intellectual and radical liberal person He was a very active critic during the years of crisis in Italy after the First World War and during the early years of Fascist rule He had to leave Italy and settled down in Paris where he soon died He died because his health was bad after the Fascists had terrorized him

Manama is the capital city of Bahrain It is also the largest city in Bahrain having almost 150000 residents 

Manama has been a city since at least the 1300s when it was mentioned in Islamic books It was owned by Portugal from 1521 to 1602 by Persia from 1602 to 1783 and by the Al Khalifa family for a long time after that In 1971 Manama became the capital city of Bahrain

The city is divided into a few parts 

Protists are single celled eukaryotes which are a type of organism Some autotrophic and others are heterotrophic

Most protists are very small They are made up of one or a few cells at best they are broken wikt linkmicroscopicmicroscopic and therefore usually invisible to the naked eye Some algae are protists if they are single celled Many protists are part of the plankton and are very important for the ecosystem The cells found in protists may be extremely complex and are often little understood It is now possible to do DNA sequencing and a number of protists have been analysed The results show that the Protista is not a monophyletic group It is paraphyletic and not a single clade The taxonomy of the Protista is therefore rather confused 

Some protists cause diseases Plasmodium falciparum causes malaria sleeping sickness is also caused by a protist

An example of a single celled organism in the protist kingdom is the Paramecium or slipper animalcule The Paramecium moves using its small hair like fibers called cilia and eats using the cilia to sweep the food into its food vacuole Other protists can be amoebas which move by extending pseudopods and flowing into them or flowing around food particles and engulfing them

Protists are not a monophyletic clade The term is a convenient holdall for about 20 different kinds of single celled eukaryotes They differ in their cell organelles specialised units which carry out well defined functions like mitochondria and plastids This proves they have made the transition from prokaryotes in different ways It is fairly clear now that all or most of these organelles have their origin in once independent prokaryotes and that the eukaryote cell is a community of micro organisms working together in a marriage of convenience Admittedly the Protista is a collection of disparate single celled forms but while a more sophisticated taxonomy is in flux Protista is still a useful term

The Apple Dumpling Gang is a Disney movie from 1975 in which three orphan children find gold during Californias Gold Rush Tim Conway and Don Knotts also star in it as two gangsters

The movie is based on the book of the same name by Jack Bickham

The 0s are the first decade in the 1st century and 1st millennium It is unusual because it has only 9 years Normally a decade has 10 years however the year zero does not exist The decade started at 1 AD and ended at 9 AD Because the year zero does not exist the first year of this decade was preceded by 1 BC

Those people had significant influence on things in this decade

1001 was a common year that started on Wednesday when the Julian calendar was used It was the first year of the 2nd millennium and the 11th century

1009 was a common year when the Julian calendar was used It was the ninth year of the 2nd millennium and the 11th century

1024 was a common year when the Julian calendar was used It was the twenty fourth year of the 2nd millennium and the 11th century

Quentin Tarantino is an American filmmaker He was born in Knoxville Tennessee Tarantino is an independent movie maker He wrote directed and acted in Pulp Fiction Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill as well as others Pulp Fiction Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill are all very violent but are also funny He won an Academy Award in 1994 for Pulp Fiction

The Leander class frigate or Type 12M is a type of ship that was used by the Royal Navy

The class became well known through the Warship BBC television drama series

A spacecraft is a vessel that can safely move people and cargo outside the Earths atmosphere through space to other planetary bodies space stations or orbits Spacecraft which are launched from the surface of a planet are called launch vehicles and usually take off from launch pads at spaceports 

Most spacecraft today are propelled by rocket motors which shoot hot gases and fire opposite to the direction of travel Other forms of propulsion are used when appropriate Spacecraft which do not need to escape from strong gravity may use ion thrusters or other more efficient methods 

Because of the very large amount of energy needed to leave the Earths gravity spacecraft are usually very expensive to build launch and operate Plans for future spacecraft often focus on reducing these costs so more people can participate in space But today costs are still very high and until recently most spacecraft were sponsored by wealthy national governments 

Most expensive of all is to send people in to space due to their needs for food water air living space safety and control People participating in this way have special names Americans call themselves astronauts Russians call themselves cosmonauts Chinese call themselves taikonauts

Acoustics is the study of sound

Public finance is the study of how the government raises funds and spends its money and their economic effect

A budget is an account of the estimated revenue and estimated expenditure within a fiscal year

There are three types of budgets

An indirect tax is a tax that is paid as part of a product Many countries tax gasoline or cigarettes but they do so indirectly Because of the tax the product will be more expensive In turn the shops will then pay the tax for the number of packets of cigarettes they sold or for the amount of gasoline This is opposed to a direct tax which is directly paid by the consumer

Erode is a city in Tamil Nadu India It is the capital of the Erode district About 500000 people live in the city Erode District in Tamil Nadu State is very important market centre for Turmeric Turmeric is received not only from Erode district but also from the other parts of Tamil Nadu and adjoining district like Mysore in Karnataka State 

Erode is well known for marketing of textile products of Handloom Powerloom and Readymade Garments The Handloom and Powerloom products such as Cotton Sarees Bed Spreads Carpets Lungies Printed Fabrics Towels Dhotis are marketed here in bulk

Kangeyam is famous for Bulls and Oil Mills Kangeyam cows are not noted for their yield but their availability in large numbers has helped the district to make a mark in the field of dairy development

Rhetoric is the art of persuading people by speaking and by writing People can be trained in this skill It is the art or the technique of persuasion used by orators Its origin was in Ancient Greece of the 5th century BC They made their decisions by speaking for or against proposals in a public place Also speeches were made when a person was accused of a serious crime before the magistrates

The Romans who were much influenced by the ancient Greeks also used the same methods for decision making Cicero was one of their famous orators In their case the debates did not involve all citizens just the Roman Senate or the courts

Because rhetoric was so important to them the Greeks and Romans wrote about how to be a good rhetorician This is sometimes called secondary rhetoric It is a technique which can be taught and used in writing An early example is Plato who wrote his works in the form of dialogues Each question raised is discussed between two characters One character is called Socrates and the other was some other philosopher This idea is well known now and has been copied many times

In mediaeval universities rhetoric was taught as part of the curriculum Rhetoric dialectic and grammar form the trivium which with the quadrivium make up the seven liberal arts of Western culture During Antiquity and the Middle Ages rhetoric was used for persuasion in public and political arenas and also in the courts of justice Several hundred rhetorical figures were recognised by classical rhetoricians Some of these are still in use such as metaphor simile and paradox

The words rhetoric or sophism are often used with a negative meaning of disinformation or propaganda They are also used to describe a speech with doubtful or slanted arguments Some very witty things have been said against orators and their rhetoric

As the art of persuasion the rhetoric continues to be important in present day public life This includes the following

According to Aristotle rhetoric has three methods of persuasion

A skill or technique is a learned ability to do something It could be playing a musical instrument or playing a kind of sport or even doing something simple like using a corkscrew Someone who is trying to do something but not succeeding may be using the wrong technique Skill does not always have to be something physical it may refer to the way a person approaches a problem

Examples of skills are

Hamas is a Palestinian Islamist Sunni organisation It was started in 1987 during the First Intifada by Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz al Rantissi as the Gaza branch of the Muslim Brotherhood organziation in Egypt In the 2006 Palestinian election Hamas got 74 of 132 seats in parliament and controls the Gaza Strip The group wants to build a Palestinian state based on Islamic ideas in the area that is now Israel the West Bank and Gaza Strip Hamas does not recognize the State of Israel

Hamas is an acronym of the Arabic phrase  or Harakat al Muqawama al Islamiyya or Islamic Resistance Movement

Hamas is known for its military wing the Izz ad Din al Qassam Brigades which plans and carries out attacks on Israel Because of numerous suicide bombings and rocket attacks on Israel the United States European Union and other countries call it a terrorist organisation The country of Jordan has made the group illegal However a lot of the international press including the Israeli English language daily newspaper Haaretz call Hamas members by the more neutral term militants

In early 2006 Hamas won a clear victory in the vote for the Palestinian parliament Voters saw Hamas as an alternative to exchange the long ruling Fatah party the main part of the PLO Fatah had not improved the Palestinian peoples conditions and reached statehood and was thought to be corrupt

Hamas has shown its organizational ability by building health education and social services to help the population in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip where there is much poverty Such efforts have increased its support In the first half of 2007 Hamas gained political control of the Gaza Strip while Fatah keeps its headquarters in the West Bank

Hamas is also associated in some way with Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine headed by Ahmed Jibril

A suicide attack is an attack where the attacker plans on killing people while also dying in the process In a suicide attack the attacker dies as a result of the attack for example in an explosion or a crash

Nowadays suicide attacks are often done with a vehicle or an explosive material such as a bomb or sometimes both If everything goes according to plan the attacker is killed as soon as their attack is complete

Suicide attacks are often done in a crowded place so that as many people as possible are killed They are common in the Middle East Most attacks on Israel carried out by Hamas or other Palestinian terrorist groups are suicide bombings

A Laser is a machine that makes an amplified single colour source of light This source of light acts like light from a tiny point If you put special lenses in front of it you can make laser light into a very narrow beam A laser uses mirrors to turn the light into a single colour and make the light act as if it is from a tiny point It uses gases to make the light amplified like in a fluorescent light bulb LASER is actually an acronym that stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation

A laser creates light by a very specific mechanism involving an optical gain medium Basically the mechanism is to take advantage of the amount of time an optical gain medium will spend in an excited state First the medium is excited by a separate pumping source raising the energy in the medium to the level of an excited state for example as in Figure 1 However the energy is not emitted all at once but rather a fast transition due to the excited state having a shorter lifetime from an excited state to the metastable state occurs Next a slow transition because the metastable state has a longer lifetime from metastable state back down to the ground state is observed which is the actual laser radiation This amplification is due to the fast pace of putting the medium into the metastable state which releases its energy at a slower rate than the faster process of putting the medium into the metastable state Thus there is spends most of its time in the metastable state ready to emit radiation This process of maintaining an energy level is called saturation and creates a very intense continuous beam of light at a very narrow wavelength which we would identify as a laser beam1

The flash light provides the pumping energy to the optical medium in this case a crystal of ruby As described above the radiation saturates the medium in a higher energy level which emits light when it returns to a lower energy level This light now moves through the medium between the two mirrors that reflect the light back and forth between them One of the mirrors however only partially reflects the light allowing some to escape The escaping light makes up the laser beam 1

This is a simple design the type of medium used usually defines the type of laser which is not always a crystal Crystals used for lasers include ruby as well as a garnet crystal made of yttrium and aluminum with the rare earth metal mixed in Gases can be used for laser by using helium nitrogen carbon dioxide neon or others Finally the smallest lasers using semiconductor diodes to produce the light 1

Albert Einstein was the first to put forward the idea of stimulated emission that could produce a laser From that point many years were spent confirming the presence of the phenomenon but it was not until 1959 that the term laser was coined by Gordon Gould in a research paper The first working laser was put together and operated by Theodore Maiman at the Hughes Research Laboratories in 1960 using a solid ruby laser such as the one in Figure 2 2

Lasers have found many uses in everyday life as well as in industry Lasers are found in CD and DVD players where they read the code from the disk that gets translated into a song or movie A laser is also used to read the bar code on items being purchased allowing quick identification of a product Lasers are used in the medicine particularly in LASIK eye surgery where the laser is used to repair the shape of the cornea A very important application of lasers is as a light source of spectroscopic studies in chemistry A laser is even used to measure the distance of the Moon from Earth by reflecting off a large reflector left by the Apollo missions and measuring the time it takes for the light to travel to the Moon and back again

NBC whose letters once stood for The National Broadcasting Company is an American television network that started in 1926 as a radio station It is owned by movie studio Universal and appliance company General Electric General Electric is currently in a deal to sell 51 of the company to Comcast

It is called the Peacock Network because of the title animal in its logo

The network is also famous for its three note chimes and the Must See TV phrase

Thiruvananthapuram is the capital city of the Indian state of Kerala The city used to be known by the name of Trivandrum It is on the west coast of India near the far south of the mainland With 889191 people as of 2001 it is the biggest city in Kerala in terms of size and number of people

The city is the state capital and houses many national and state government offices organizations and companies It is also a major center of learning and is home to several schools and colleges including Kerala University and to many scientific institutions the most prominent being the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre Sree Chitra Tirunal Instiute for Medical Sciences and Technology Technopark Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology and Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology

Thiruvananthapuram literally means City of Lord Anantha in Malayalam The name derives from the god of the Hindu temple at the centre of the city Anantha is the serpent Shesha on whom Padmanabhan or Vishnu lies The temple of Vishnu lying on Anantha the Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple is the most recognizable landmark of the city The city was officially known as Trivandrum in English until 1991 when the government decided to change the citys name back to the original name Thiruvananthapuram in all languages However the city is still widely referred to as Trivandrum

The city is fully electrified by the Kerala State Electricity Board The district is divided in to three circles Transmission circle Thiruvananthapuram city and Kattakkada Domestic users account for 43 of the total power usage or 90 million units per month Thiruvananthapuram district has one 220 kV nine 110 kV and six 66 kV electrical substations A 400 kV substation has just been commissioned by the Power Grid Corporation and will ensure high quality power supply to the city 

The water supply schemes cover 100 within the city limits It is 84 of the urban and 69 of the rural population when the district is considered Peppara and Aruvikkara dams are the main sources of water for distribution in the capital city The new project plan for improving the water supply with Japan aid covers Thiruvananthapuram city and six suburban panchayats having urban characteristics 

The sewerage system in the city was implemented at the time of the Travancore Kingdom and modernised in 1938 This scheme for the disposal of sullage and sewage is an underground system The whole system is controlled by Kerala Water Authority now The city area is divided in to seven blocks for the execution of the sewerage system two commissioned in the 1990s and two after 2000 The sewerage is pumped to a stilling chamber at the Sewerage Treatment Plant at Valiyathura and is disposed through sewage farming Diary Development Department maintains this sewage farm and fodder cultivation is done here There is no revenue generation from this scheme and the sewerage system in the city is a service provided to the residents

Apart from being the capital of Indias most literate and socially developed state Thiruvananthapuram is a strategically important city in Southern India Being the largest city in Indias deep south it is important for both military logistics and civil aviation in the southern part of the country It is the headquarters of the Southern Air Command of the Indian Air Force The city is very close to the international shipping route and East West shipping axis Also it falls under the international air route Due to the strategic importance of the city the Indian Air Force authorities have planned to make an aerospace command in SAC The plan for setting up a new Tri Service Command which will integrate all the three forces under a single command is also in the pipeline

Being the Indian city with the closest air link to the small island country of Maldives and also Sri Lanka the citys medical and health infrastructure caters to patients from both countries especially Maldives Exports of perishables and medicines from Trivandrum International Airport run to full capacity on everyday flights to Maldives and Sri Lanka because of this nearness Thiruvananthapuram also provides a key link in movement of goods and passengers to and from southern Tamilnadu into Kerala the state border being just 30 km away The city is also important for people from around the world seeking help through Ayurveda medicine and therapy Ayurveda resorts are coming up at a rapid pace along the International Beach of Kovalam and Varkala coast

Animal Farm is a short political fable by George Orwell based on Joseph Stalins betrayal of the Russian Revolution Orwell wrote it because he wished to destroy what he called the Soviet myth Like Nineteen Eighty Four the story is one of the most famous political allegories in the world It is about a group of animals who rebel against the humans from the farm they live on and run it themselves with hopes of being equal free and happy In the end however the new rule becomes a cruel tyranny of its own led by the pigs Written during World War II and published in 1945 it was not well received at first but is widely accepted as a classic today

The animals of the Manor Farm live in cruel condition of exploitation under the sway of Mr Jones a bad and always drunken man One day the Old Major an old pig convened a meeting of all the animals and told them about a dream that he had the previous night He had dreamed about an old song that incited to rebellion against the human beings Everyone was very excited and about three months later they revolted against Mr Jones and they took possession of the farm The rebellion was led by the pigs that were the most intelligent animals of the farm The purpose of the revolution was to create a fair society made only by animals based on seven commandments that could be summed up with the maxim Four legs good two legs bad In a short time among the pigs there was tension because Snowball an inventive and vivacious pig wanted to build a windmill but Napoleon a big and fierce looking pig was skeptical So the animals formed two parties In the meantime Mr Jones wanted to regain the farm but the animals succeeded in the battle and Mr Jones was forced to run away One day Napoleon arrived in the farm with nine big and ferocious dogs that incited against Snowball that ran away bleeding From that day Napoleon was the real dictator of the farm if someone was not agreed with him he was eaten up by his dogs and if something did not work like the building of the windmill it was all Snowballs fault Napoleon had pity on nobody when Boxer the strongest horse in the farm lost his power because of the old age he unexpectedly led him to slaughter Now Napoleon and the pigs were like Mr Jones they exploited the other animals they took advantage of the foolishness of some animals and they came into contact with human beings for business although they established it was forbidden In the end they became like human beings they started to walk on their hind legs and they changed the old maxim with a new one Four legs good two legs better Nothing was changed and the rebellion had been useless

Orwell who was a socialist wrote in the introduction of the 1947 Ukranian translation of Animal Farm that he got the idea from seeing a young boy whipping a large cart horse He explained It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat

There are many characters in the book who are based on real people They are grouped into pigs horses humans and other animals 

Animalism is a system of beliefs shared by the farm animals of Manor Farm The purpose is to ensure the farm animals behave like actual animals and not follow the footsteps of humans beings Therefore any human behavior is considered contrary to the spirit of Animalism

In the story this song was sung by animals of England once upon a time It is named Beasts of England with a stirring tune a cross between Clementine and Cucuracha This song became popular among the animals of England after Old Major recited it to the farm animals of Manor Farm It serves as the 1st national anthem of Animal Farm

These are the original commandments laid down by the pigs

Four legs good two legs bad

Miso is a thick paste It is similar to the Korean doenjang It is made by fermenting soy beans with sea salt and kji Kji is the product of fermenting rice barley or soybeans with a mold culture kji kin Often grains such as barley or rice and sometimes other ingredients are added Miso is high in protein and rich in vitamins and minerals Miso tastes salty and depending on the grains used and fermentation time may also be sweet Miso is used to make miso soup

Miso is a very important part of Japanese food However some Japanese people are eating less miso because they are trying to be healthy by eating less saltcn There are different kinds of miso Kome miso is made from rice and beans Mame miso is made from beans Mugi miso is made from barley and beans Tyougo miso is a mix of these misos

Miso first came to Japan from China or the Korean peninsula Ancient Chinese jan is the origin of miso Jan is an ancient fermented seasoning According to classical scholars jan was called hishio or kuki in the Edo era In China jan was written about in the Shurai an ancient Chinese 

Miso existed in the Jomon era in Japan Jan is the Japanese original seasoning In the Nara era jan was found in Nishi city Heiankyo Miso was used for seasoning porridge made of rice and vegetables In the sengoku period Miso was important to preserved food 

Many Japanese used to make miso in their own homes This was called Temae miso In the Muromachi era it was used as a food preservative and as a seasoning Miso was an important source of nutrient for solders In the Edo era industrial mass production method of miso was began Temae miso became less common

Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup It is made from a stock called dashi into which softened miso is dissolved Various solid ingredients like wakame seaweed tofu from soybeans and mushrooms are then added to make the finished soup The soup is usually served in lacquer bowls with lids and drunk directly from the bowl Solid ingredients are eaten with chopsticks Different types of miso produce distinctive soups

Wakame is a type of edible kelp Its scientific name is Undaria pinnatifida

It is distributed either dried or salted It is often used in miso soup and salads In Korea it is called miyeok It is used in salads or as the main ingredient in miyeok soup In China it is called qundaicai Chinese production is concentrated around Dalian

In New Zealand Undaria pinnatifida is a very serious weed and is one of the 100 worst invasive species in the world It was first discovered in Wellington Harbour in 1987 It probably arrived accidentally in the late 1980s via shipping from Asia in ballast water Native to cold temperate coastal areas of Japan Korea and China in recent decades it has also established in France Britain Spain Italy Argentina and Australia

Undaria is now found around much of south eastern New Zealand and as far north as Auckland It spreads in two ways Naturally through the millions of microscopic spores released by each fertile plant and attached to vessel hulls and marine farming equipment

Undaria is a highly successful and fertile species which makes it a serious invader However its impacts are not well understood and are likely to vary depending on the location

Kelp is a type of marine seaweed It is a brown alga There are many different kinds of kelp Kelp grow in large forests usually near the surface of the water Some kelps grow very fast Kelp can reach a length of up to 60 m The blades are kept afloat by gas filled bladders

Kelp plays an important role as food and habitat for fish and other forms It may be eaten as a vegetable

Tofu sometimes also called doufu or bean curd is a food made by coagulating soy milk and then pressing the resulting curds into blocks The making of tofu from soy milk is similar to the technique of making cheese from milk Wheat gluten or seitan in its steamed and fried forms is often mistakenly called tofu in Asian or vegetarian dishes

In Japan tofu is a common food used in miso soup or as a hot dish

China has more kinds of tofu than Japan and various tofu foods

In America tofu is becoming more popular since Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke on the effect of tofu on the TV Today Americans buy tofu at the grocery store The word tofu takes root in common use

In Korea Vietnam Cambodia Thailand Myanmar and Indonesia tofu is daily food

Tofu is rich in textured vegetable protein Calorie is relatively low Dietary fiber is a little for process More and more American and European use it as health food

Soy milk is a milk like product made from soybeans

Soy milk originated in Eastern Asia China a region where the soybean was native It was used as food long before the existence of written records Later on the soybean and soybean foods were moved to Japan 

Dashi is a simple soup stock used in Japanese cooking The most common form of dashi is a simple broth or stock made by heating kombu and katsuobushi in water and then straining the resultant liquid Dashi is the base for miso soup Japanese noodle broth and many Japanese simmering liquids Fresh dashi made from kelp and katsuobushi is rare today even in Japan Most people use granulated or liquid instant substitutes

Other kinds of dashi stock are made by soaking kelp shiitake or niboshi in water for many hours or heating them in water nearly to boiling and then straining the resultant broth Kelp stock or konbu dashi is made by soaking kelp or sea tangle in water Shiitake dashi stock is made by soaking dried shiitake mushrooms in water Niboshi dashi stock is made by soaking small dried sardines in water

Other important Japanese flavors include shoyu mirin rice vinegar miso and sake

The shiitake mushroom also known as Chinese black mushroom or black forest mushroom is an edible mushroom typically grown on the shii tree Two Chinese variant names for high grades of shiitake are dngg and hug both are produced at colder temperatures

Soy sauce or soya sauce is a fermented sauce made from soy beans roasted grain water and salt It is commonly used in Asian cuisine and appears in some Western cuisine dishes especially as an ingredient in Worcestershire sauce Real soy sauces are fermented with kji and other related microorganisms Almost all soy sauce has some alcohol added during bottling This acts as a preservative to protect it from going bad For this reason soy sauce should always be kept in the fridge It should also not be put in direct light An opened bottle of soy sauce that has been left unrefrigerated could become slightly bitter

Although there are many types of soy sauce all are salty and earthy tasting brownish liquids used to season food while cooking or at the table What some westerners can only describe as a flavorful kind of sweet taste is a distinct basic taste called umami by the Japanese and xian wei by the Chinese

Although this seasoning was first used in China it is used several cuisines across Asia and is a particularly important flavoring in Japanese cuisine However Chinese and Japanese soy sauces are different and it is not really possible to use one instead of another

A bowl is a container for food It can hold liquids such as soups and solids like popcorn People also prepare salads in it A bowl is like a ball cut in half Bowls are usually made from glass ceramic wood or plastic 

The Oktoberfest is a German festival that takes place on the Theresienwiese a public place in the center of Munich It is every year from the end of September to the beginning of October It is a big social event There is lots of eating and drinking It is on for sixteen days ending on the first Sunday in October If this is the first or the second the festival is extended to the end on 3 October the Day of German Unity This is the day when East Germany and West Germany joined into one country again in 1990

The first Oktoberfest was on 12 October 1810 The feast was for the wedding of King Ludwig I of Bavaria and Therese of Sachsen Hildeburghausen The feast lasted for 5 days There was music and you could eat and drink At the end of it there was a big horse race The next years they organized this horse race and the feast again because the people had liked it so much

Today the Oktoberfest is the worlds largest fair and it has become very famous and popular About six million people visit it every year Many people and tourists from all over the world come to Munich for Oktoberfest Other cities all over the world have even copied the Oktoberfest and now they also hold feasts that are similar to the Oktoberfest

One of the famous attractions is a big dipper called the Wilde Maus which means Wild mouse in English

There are 14 main tents at the Oktoberfest

 A hot dog is a type of food It may have first came from England but is now well known in the United States In the United States hot dogs are very popular in areas with large numbers of European immigrants such as Chicago Brooklyn and Detroit The word hot dog refers to the belief that many people thought hot dogs had actual dog meat In a few places hot dogs are also called red hots

A hot dog is made of the remains of the pig after other parts are cut off and sold as bacon sausage patties and ham However many people across the world eat hot dogs and enjoy them very much Hot dogs can be boiled grilled or fried The word frankfurter comes from Frankfurt Germany This is where pork sausages that were like hot dogs first came from This sausage is usually served in a bun or another type of bread The most common type of hot dogs are made from beef sometimes mixed with pork Chicken and vegetarian hot dogs are popular as well Animal parts are used in most hot dogs and may include skin lips pig snouts organs fat and other parts of animal bodies Hot dogs and other sausage products were first developed as a way to sell these parts that people would not normally eat Nearly 20 of the weight of a hot dog is usually non meat ingredients including water sugar and spices Some legal categories of hot dogs such as frankfurters can contain up to 35 of non meat fillers as well such as corn meal

To add to the taste various toppings and sauces are often added The most common sauces in the United States are ketchup mustard and pickle relish Onions chopped pickles peppers hot sauce and cheese are also sometimes added to the food Onions cooked in tomato sauce and Sauerkraut are popular toppings as is chili 

In the United States there are many different types of hot dogs with different combinations of chili cheese onions mustard and other products One of the most popular types of hot dogs is a chili dog There are many different types of chili dogs One of the most well known is a Coney Island dog a dog topped with a blend of chili cheese mustard and onions that is originally from Michigan  Other types of chili dogs include Michigan dogs which are from upstate New York and Texas dogs which are from Pennsylvania  Both Michigan and Texas dogs are spicy the Texas dog has spicy sauce and the Michigan dog has a spicy weiner Chili dogs are also popular in the Southwestern United States Another type of hot dog is a Chicago dog which is a Vienna beef weiner topped with mustard onion neon green pickle relish peppers tomatoes and a pickle

A type of hot dog called a kosher hot dog is very common in parts of the United States and overseas It is similar to most hot dogs except that it is always made of beef has more salt and spice added to it and is made with help from a Rabbi Halal hot dogs are also made

Though hot dogs are most popular in the United States they are served in many places around the world People in Japan eat a lot of hot dogs and the worlds largest hot dog ever was made there In some countries hot dog is the name of a completely different sausage dish for example in New Zealand it is used to mean corn dog and hot dogs are called American hot dogs instead

Constipation is when it is very hard to get rid of digested food waste Constipation can be caused by many things One is eating or drinking too much dairy products that use cow milk To solve this problem many people use a laxative Another possible cause could be an obstruction somewhere along the digestive tract

When a person is constipated their lower stomach and intestinal area will be blocked People can usually conquer constipation by eating natural laxatives such a fruits fruit juice and dietary supplements Liquid will help get rid of constipation Constipation can occur by eating hard food

A kernel is the central part of an operating system It manages the tasks of the computer and the hardware  most notably memory and CPU time

There are two types of kernels

The kernel is the most fundamental part of an operating system It can be thought of as the program which controls all other programs on the computer It is responsible for the creation and destruction of memory space which allows software to run It provides services so that programs can request the use of the network driver the disk or any other piece of hardware manages the file system and sets interrupts for the CPU to enable multitasking Many kernels are also responsible for ensuring that faulty programs do not interfere with the operation of others by denying access to memory that has not been allocated to them and restricting the amount of CPU time they can consume

All of the operating systems commonly used use Monolithic kernels In Linux for example drivers are often implemented as part of kernel When a device is needed its extension is loaded and joined onto the kernel  in other words making the kernel larger Monolithic kernels are problematic in that if one of these device drivers is faulty then because it is part of the kernel it often overrides the mechanisms put in place to deal with faulty programs This can mean that the kernel  and thus the entire computer  can cease to function If there are too many devices the kernel can also run out of memory  causing a system crash or making the computer very slow

Microkernels are a way of solving this problem In a microkernel operating system the kernel deals only with critical activities  such as controlling the memory and CPU  and nothing else Drivers and other functions that monolithic kernels would normally do within the kernel are moved outside the kernel where they are under control Instead of being an uncontrollable part of the kernel the beta driver is therefore no more unlikely to cause a crash as a beta web browser  that is that if a driver goes wrong it can simply be restarted by the kernel Unfortunately creating microkernel based operating systems is very difficult and there are no operating systems like these that are commonly used Minix is a microkernel operating system

People say a country is landlocked if it does not have access to any oceans or seas As an example Austria is landlocked France is not landlocked because it has access to the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean A sea is also landlocked if does not have access to an ocean As an example the Caspian Sea is landlocked The Gulf of Mexico is not landlocked because it has access to the Atlantic Ocean

Kyrgyzstan formally the Kyrgyz Republic and sometimes known as Kirghizia is a country in Central Asia The country is landlocked and mountainous It has borders with China Kazakhstan Tajikistan and Uzbekistan Its capital is Bishkek It was a Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union but became independent in 1991 The country was peaceful in the 1990s Its president Askar Akayev showed an autocratic and authoritarian character 

In 2005 there was an unexpected revolution after the elections of parliament in March President Akayev resigned on April 4 of that year Opposition leaders formed a coalition and a new government was formed led by President Kurmanbek Bakiyev and Prime Minister Feliks Kulov

Kebab means grilled meat in Persian and Turkish Kebab is usually made of lamb and beef Sometimes chicken and fish are used for some styles Pork is never used by Muslims but is sometimes used by non Muslim sellers Muslims are not allowed to eat pork for religious reasons 

There are many varieties of kebab and the term means different things in different countries The generic term kebab usually refers to doner kebab or dner kebap in Europe and to shish kebab in the United States though its meaning can vary 

Perhaps the earliest recipe is in the tenth century Kitab al Tabeekh  by Ibn Sayyar al Warraq of Baghdad His recipe for Kebab Khalis uses thin slices of lean meat salted and grilled in an ungreased frying pan

Halaal is an Islamic Arabic term meaning permissible It has both a general and specific meaning

Humanism is a philosophy or way of thinking about the world Humanism is set of ethics or ideas about how people should live and act People who hold this set of ethics are called Humanists 

Humanist ideas were first discussed in Ancient Greece Among the important Humanist philosophers were Plato and Aristotle 

The writings of the ancient Greeks were studied in the 1400s during the Renaissance There were many Humanist thinkers at this time There was an important Humanist academy set up in Florence by Lorenzo Medici Some of the philosophers writers and poets who were at the academy were Marsilio Ficino Pico della Mirandola Cristoforo Landino and Angolo Poliziano 

Humanist ethics affected peoples thinking in many ways Many philosophers began to discuss the church government education and human rights in different ways Because of this the period of European history from 1600 until 1800 is called The Age of Reason Some of the important philosophers were Desiderius Erasmus Francis Bacon Ren Descartes Blaise Pascal Isaac Newton Galileo Galilei John Milton 

The Guardian is a British newspaper It is published every day except on Sunday The Sunday edition is known as The Observer

The newspaper was founded in 1821 It was founded by textile traders and merchants The Guardian was seen as an organ of the middle class or in the words of CP Scotts son Ted a paper that will remain bourgeois to the last  I write for the Guardian said Sir Max Hastings in 2005 because it is read by the new establishment reflecting the papers growing influence 

Three of the four people who wrote leaders for the Guardian joined the Social Democratic Party on its foundation in 1982 The paper supported Tony Blair when he wanted to lead the Labour Party and to become Prime Minister

The Observer is the Sunday edition of The Guardian mostly the same except with a different name

Those who read it have a centre left political orientation The Guardian is considered British centre left

Algae is the name for certain plant like living things that can make food from sunlight The study of algae is called phycology or algology

Algae are a large and diverse group of simple typically autotrophic organisms ranging from unicellular to multicellular forms The largest and most complex marine forms are called seaweeds They are like plants and simple because they lack the many distinct organs found in land plants For that reason they are not classified as plants

Though the prokaryotic Cyanobacteria were included as Algae in older textbooks this is outdated The term Algae is now used for eukaryotic organisms All true algae therefore have a nucleus enclosed within a membrane and chloroplasts bound in one or more membranes However algae are definitely not a monophyletic group as they do not all descend from a common algal ancestor Modern taxonomists propose splitting them up into monophyletic groups but there is at present no consensus as to the details

Algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants such as leaves roots and other organs that are found in plants Nearly all algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from the cyanobacteria and so produce oxygen as a by product of photosynthesis unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green bacteria Some unicellular species rely entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus

Fossilized filamentous algae from the Vindhya basin have been dated back to 16 to 17 billion years ago

Algae are usually found in damp places or water and are common on land as well as water However terrestrial algae are usually rather inconspicuous and are far more common in moist tropical regions than dry ones Algae lack vascular tissues and other adaptations to live on land but they can endure dryness and other conditions in symbiosis with a fungus as lichen

The various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology Microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column are called phytoplankton They provide the food base for most marine food chains Kelp grows mostly in shallow marine waters Some are used as human food or harvested for agar or fertilizer Kelp can grow in large stands called kelp forests These forests prevent some of the damage from waves Many different species live in them including sea urchins sea otters and abalone 

Some algae may harm other species Some algae may reproduce a lot and make an algal bloom These algae may produce protective toxins which can kill fish in the water Dinoflagellates secrete a compound that turns the flesh of fish into slime The algae then consume this nutritious liquid

Algae have evolved a number of symbiotic partnerships with other organisms The most famous is the plant like lichen which are each formed by a fungus with an alga It is a highly successful life form and twenty thousand species are known In all cases the lichen are quite different in appearance and life style from either constituent it is possibly the most complete symbiosis known Both constituents gain from their access to niches with low nutrient value which is where lichen are found

Less well known are the algal relationships with animals Reef building corals are basically social Cnidarian polyps Corals are dependent on light because the algae are important partners and they require light Corals have evolved structures often tree like which offer the algae maximum access to light The coral weakens the algal cell walls and digests about 80 of the food synthesised by the algae The corals waste products provide nutrients for the algae so as with lichen both partners gain from the association The algae are golden brown flagellate algae often of the genus Symbiodinium A curious feature of the partnership is that the coral may eject the algae in hard times and regain them later The ejection of the algal partner is called bleaching because the coral loses its colourp200

Other types of Cnideria such as sea anemones and jellyfish also contain algae Jellyfish with algae behave so that their partners get the best light during the day and descend to depths at night where the water is rich in nitrates and brown with decay Sea slugs and clams are also well known for harbouring algae Both groups are molluscs The sea slugs graze on coral and are the same colour as the coral they graze They are able to separate the algae from the polyp tissues they digest The algal cells are moved to its tentacles where they continue to live The otherwise defenceless slug gains both camouflage and nutritionp204 The giant clam keeps algae in its mantle which is revealed when the clam is open The coloured mantle has places where the skin is transparent and acts like a lens to concentrate light on the algae beneath When the algae get too numerous the clam digests themp203

Various other marine invertebrate groups have members which symbiont with algae Flatworms and Polychaete worms are two such groups

Kelp forests are a type of marine ecosystem that is present around colonies of kelp they contain rich biodiversity Kelp can stretch 2 30 meters or more from their anchors on the sea floor to the surface It provides a vertical infrastructure that is home to many fish and invertebrate species Kelp forests also often attract mammalian visitors including whales sea lions sea otters and SCUBA diving humans

Kelp forests draw their name from an analogy to forests on land

Symbiosis means living together It describes close and long term relationships between different species The term was coined by Anton de Bary in 1879 after the nature of lichen was discovered

A symbiont is an organism living in a relationship with another species in which one or both get benefits When one species lives inside another species or a microscopic symbiont lives inside the cells of a host it is called an endosymbiont

The relevance of symbiosis is its frequency and its evolutionary significance There appear to be no higher plants or animals without symbionts Those symbionts are of great importance to the larger organisms who in most cases would be unable to live as they do without their symbionts Mycorrhiza in higher plants and gut flora in insects and vertebrates are examples Humans are no exception

Furthermore most of these associations are between organisms not just from different species but from different kingdoms And lastly the cells of all eukaryotes contain organelles which are descendents of symbiotic relationships which began at least a billion years ago Mitochondria and plastids are examples The conclusion must be that symbiosis has been highly significant in the evolution of life

The definition of symbiosis is controversial among scientists Some believe symbiosis should only refer to persistent mutualisms while others believe it should apply to all kinds of persistent biological interactions

The widest definition includes parasitism mutualism commensalism and competition  

The various forms of symbiosis include

Symbiosis does not always benefit both partners This is what may happen

This kind of symbiosis is called endosymbiosis Examples are

Almost for certain this happened to form the eukaryote cell Thats the type of cell all animals and plants are made of The organelles inside the cell such as mitochondria and chloroplasts contain some DNA This DNA is the remnant of a once separate bacterium The theory is that the eukaryote cell evolved by the fusion of several bacteria or archaea organisms

Al Ain is a city in the United Arab Emirates The city name literally means the spring or the eye in Arabic This name come from the water sources in the area The city is in the emirate of Abu Dhabi right next to the border with Oman It is often called the Garden City of the Persian Gulf because of the many parks tree lined avenues and decorative roundabouts within the city Al Ain Abu Dhabi and Dubai form a kind of geographic triangle in the center of the country Each city is around 150 kilometers from the other two 

Al Ain is the fourth largest metropolitan area by population in the Emirates with a population of 348000 There are more Emirati nationals in Al Ain than other places in the country but most who live there are people who left other countries particularly from the Indian sub continent There are fewer Western people than in the larger centers of Abu Dhabi and Dubai This gives Al Ain a more Arabic look and feel compared to the larger cities of the Emirates

The area has been lived in for more than 4000 years and Al Ain is central to the cultural heritage of the country There are many underground water springs in the area This explains why people wanted to live there Traces of its past remain including camel racing and breeding The ancient falaj system of irrigation is still in use in some areas The system brings underground water to people by a network of tunnels that come out into open channels The flow of water in the channels can be controlled

Al Ain is becoming a place that tourists visit with attractions such as Jebel Hafeet a 1340 metre high mountain that dominates the surrounding area Many tourists like to visit the mineral springs at the base and drive to the top of this mountain for sunset Al Ain regularly records the highest summer temperatures in the country but the dry desert air makes it a welcome escape from the coastal humidity of the larger cities Other attractions include the Al Ain Oasis in the city centre and other oases around the area cool places to escape the summer heat a zoo amusement park named Fun City many well kept parks popular with families in the summer evenings a heritage village as well as malls and other modern sites Important buildings include United Arab Emirates University Higher Colleges of Technology well equipped medical facilities including the teaching hospital at Tawam military training areas and Al Ain International Airport

The city is home to the successful association football club Al Ain FC

Jutland is a peninsula in northern Europe It forms the mainland part of Denmark and a northern part of Germany It separates the North Sea from the Baltic Sea Its terrain is relatively flat with low hills and peat bogs It has an area of 29775 km and a population of 2491852

The northern two thirds of the peninsula are occupied by the westernmost portion of the Kingdom of Denmark There is no separate name for the Danish portion of the peninsula so it is simply called the same name The northernmost part of Jutland became an island following a flood in 1825 the Limfjord now separates it from the mainland This island is called Nrrejydske and is still commonly reckoned as part of the peninsula it is also partly coterminous with the county and future region called North Jutland 

The southern third is made up of the German Bundesland of Schleswig Holstein with the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein Both duchies have passed back and forth between the Danes and various German rulers In the last border movement Denmark regained North Schleswig by plebiscite in 1920 Southern Schleswig remained German

The River Elbe forms the southern border of Jutland with the city of Hamburg on its shore The Danish Wadden Sea Islands and the North Frisian Islands stretch along the southwest coast of Jutland in the German Bight

The largest cities on the Jutland Peninsula are

A referendum sometimes called a plebiscite  is a vote by all the people about a political issue 

There are two types of referendum result

It usually depends on the countrys history and constitution what sort of referendum is used In Switzerland referenda are usually mandatory because the people are seen as the source of the governments mandate to govern In the United Kingdom referenda have only been advisory because the government say that the people elected parliament to make decisions

An example of a recent plebiscite was the controversial decision by Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou to let the Greek people vote on whether or not the heavily indebted nation would accept a 130 billion bailout package from the European Union The referendum sent a shockwave throughout euro zone nations as a no vote could mean Greece defaulting on its national debt losing its membership in the European Union and consequently losing the euro as its national currency

Another example was the voting on the European Constitution in 2005 The vote took place in some countries France and The Netherlands had a referendum on the subject In both states the voters said no to the proposal Referenda are an integral part of both indirect democracy and more so direct democracy

The separate simultaneous referenda held on 24 April 2004 in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the Republic of Cyprus on the comprehensive settlement plan of the UN Secretary General provides yet another example of such a vote The Plan was approved in the Turkish Cypriot referendum by 65 while it was rejected in the Greek Cypriot referendum by 75 

Problems with using Referendums

Many political problems can be solved by asking the people their opinion because the supporters of the argument will be forced to accept the decision of the people

However

 It is feared that the electorate do not have sufficient political knowledge in order to truly understand what they are voting for

 Philosophers Plato and Madison put forward the argument that voters are too easily persuaded by their own internal feelings of a matter instead of focusing on the good of the nation

Dubai or Dubayy in English refers to either 

The ruler of Dubai was the late HH Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum who was also the Vice President of the United Arab Emirates The new Ruler who is also the Vice President and the Prime Minister of the UAE is HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum who was earlier the crown prince of Dubai is one of the Sheikhs younger brothers

Dubai is the second largest emirate in the UAE after Abu Dhabi which is the capital The emirate is located on the Persian Gulf southwest of Sharjah and northeast of Abu Dhabi The town of Hatta is an exclave of the emirate of Dubai and borders nearby Oman 

Dubai is different from other members of the UAE because income from oil is only 6 of its gross domestic product Most of the emirates income is from the Jebel Ali Free Zone and now even more from tourism

There are records of the town of Dubai from 1799 Earlier in the 18th century the Al Abu Falasa line of Bani Yas clan established itself in Dubai The city was a dependent of Abu Dhabi until 1833 

On 8 January 1820 the sheikh of Dubai was one of the people who signed the British sponsored General Treaty of Peace

In 1833 the Al Maktoum dynasty of the Bani Yas tribe left Abu Dhabi and took over Dubai without resistance From that point on Dubai a newly independent emirate was always struggling with the emirate of Abu Dhabi An attempt by the Qawasim pirates to take over Dubai was stopped In 1835 Dubai and the rest of the Trucial States signed a maritime truce with Britain and a Perpetual Maritime Truce about twenty years later Dubai came under the protection of the United Kingdom by the Exclusive Agreement of 1892 Like four of its neighbours Abu Dhabi Ras al Khaimah Sharjah and Umm al Qaiwain its being on the way to India made it an important place

In March 1892 the Trucial States were created 

The town of Dubai was an important port of call for foreign tradesmen who settled in the town Until the 1930s the town was known for its pearls

After the Gulf Rupee lost value in 1966 Dubai joined the newly independent state of Qatar to set up a new monetary unit the QatarDubai riyal Oil was discovered 120 kilometres off the coast of Dubai after which the town granted oil concessions 

On 2 December 1971 Dubai formed the United Arab Emirates together with Abu Dhabi and five other emirates This was done after former protector Britain left the Persian Gulf in 1971 In 1973 Dubai joined the other emirates to adopt a single uniform currency the UAE dirham

Oil supply in Dubai are less than 120 that of the emirate of Abu Dhabi and oil money is now only a small part of the citys total money Dubai and its twin across the Dubai creek Deira became important ports of call for Western manufacturers Most of the new citys banking and financial centers were in this area Dubai kept its importance as a trade route through the 1970s and 1980s The city of Dubai has a free trade in gold and till the 1990s was the center of a brisk smuggling trade of gold ingots to India where gold import was restricted 

Today Dubai is an important place for tourists and port but also increasingly becoming a center for service industries such as IT and finance with the new Dubai International Financial Centre Transport links are helped by its rapidly expanding Emirates Airline made by the government in 1985 and still state owned The airline is based at Dubai International Airport and carries over 12 million passengers every year The government has set up industry specific free zones throughout the city Dubai Internet City now combined with Dubai Media City as part of TECOM is one such enclave whose members include IT firms such as EMC Corporation Oracle Microsoft and IBM and media organisations such as MBC CNN Reuters ARY and AP Dubai Marina is a master plan development by EMAAR which will be the worlds largest marina when complete Dubai Knowledge Village is an education and training hub is also set up to complement the Free Zones other two clusters Dubai Internet city and Dubai Media City by providing the facilities to train the clusters future knowledge workers

Dubai had a property boom when they announced freehold property resulting in large capital investments With the global recession property prices have fallen dramatically

An exclave is strip of land that belongs to a political entity but that is not connected to it by land The strip of land is surrounded by other political entities A good example is Kaliningrad Oblast It belongs to the Russian Federation but is separated from the rest of that country by territory belonging to Lithuania and Poland

Although both meanings are close an exclave might not be an enclave An enclave is completely surrounded by one other country  For example Kaliningrad is surrounded not by one state but by two Lithuania and Poland It also borders the Baltic Sea It is not an enclave On the other hand the Spanish exclave of Llivia is an enclave in France

Many exclaves today have some sort of idea to become independent especially if the exclave is far away from the Mainland

A much more obscure use means in medical discussion a detached part of an organ as of the pancreas thyroid or other gland

The lists below are of various types of exclaves that are not enclaves

Some territories are not geographically detached from their motherland Nevertheless they are more easily reached by entering a foreign country Very often this is because of their location in a hilly area It may also be because the only road enters that foreign place before coming back to the mother country These territories may be called practical exclaves pene exclaves or quasi exclaves and can be found along many borders particularly those that are not heavily defended They will only be attached to the motherland via an extremely small or thin slice of land

later became part of Poland and Russia

In general use an enclave can be any special area of a bigger area of land such as a part of a city that has different taxes than the rest of the city

In political geography an enclave is a piece of land which has a different country totally arounded it If another country has sovereignty over it it is also called an exclave of that other country

Exclaves can also exist within a country This is when some administrative regions have holes in them

The word enclave is a relatively new word in the language of diplomacy Diplomats are used to speaking French The word comes from late Latin inclavatus which can be translated as shut in locked up The word got in the English language in the year 1868 exclave followed 3 decades later

Enclaves may be created for a variety of historical political or geographical reasons Some areas have been left as enclaves simply because a river changed its course

Since living in an enclave can be very inconvenient and many agreements have to be found by both countries over mail addresses power supply or passage rights enclaves tend to be eliminated and many cases that existed before have now been removed Sometimes it is the case that enclaves are traded for one another

In English Church history subnational enclaves were known as peculiars

Some enclaves are countries that are not part of any other country and therefore not exclaves Three such countries exist

See also List of countries that border only one other country

A panhandle is a word used in geography What people mean when they talk about panhandles is a narrow strip of land that is surrounded on all sides except one by one or more countries or regions The strip of land is connected to the country or region it belongs to on one side only This looks like the handle of a frying pan 

Panhandles include

A new town planned community or planned city is a kind of city that is designed by architects and engineers before it is built Most cities and towns just develop over the years without a clear plan Planned community neighborhoods are designed with separate districts of the city for parks stores homes and offices Planned communities have a transportation system for commuters

A park is an open place in a city or town for nature There are often trees benches statues and ponds in a park Some parks built in big cities are very large These can have fountains or picnic areas

Sometimes countries or regions set up national parks These are usually large areas of land Those areas are made to protect the habitats of animals Very often a special permit is necessary to enter Building things in the park is usually forbidden or needs a special permit

An example of a national park is Yellowstone National Park

A pond is a body of water smaller than a lake Ponds support a very wide range of wildlife ducks turtles swans small fish and frogs can live in a pond Usually in most ponds sunlight can reach to bottom In some cases ponds do not last all year round This type of pond is called a vernal pond or ephemeral seasonal or temporary wetlands These types of ponds do not have any fish

A swan is a kind of water bird from the genera Cygnus and Coscoroba They are in the subfamily Anserinae in the family Anatidae which also includes geese and ducks

Many swans live in colder places such as northern Europe Asia and North America They live on water They swim on top of the water and eat plants off the bottom of ponds lakes or oceans They also eat insects and other small animals Swans can also fly

A baby swan is called a Cygnet The name of the constellation Cygnus is from the Latin word for swan

The swans are some of the largest flying birds They are large in size and have large feet and long necks The males are usually bigger and heavier than females The Mute Swan Trumpeter Swan and Whooper Swan are the largest swans They can be over 15m long They can weigh over 15kg Their wingspans can be almost 3m 

Most swans are white These swan are found in the Northern Hemisphere This means they are found in Europe Asia and North America However the Black Swan is black with a red beak It lives in Australia The Black Necked Swan is white but it has a black neck It lives in South America They also have a small area of skin between the eyes and beak that has no feathers This area can be different colors such as yellow or orange

The Coscoroba Swan is different to the other swans Some scientists think it is more like a duck or a goose It is the smaller than the other swans This swan lives in South America

A pupa is part of becoming an adult for some insects like some butterflies moths beetles flies and bees The pupal stage comes after being a larva the next stage is adulthood

The pupa stage of a butterfly called a chrysalis is a well known example of a pupa because they are often found in the open

Paul is a common male name Some men who were called Paul are

Goose is the general English name for a large number of long necked birds belonging to the family Anatidae 

This family also includes the swans which are mostly larger than geese and the ducks which are smaller and have short necks

Geese migrate in groups in the spring and fall flying together in a V shape

A male goose is called a gander and a baby goose is called a gosling A group of geese is called a gaggle

Ovaries are organs found in female organisms Ovaries are part of the reproductive system needed to reproduce sexually 

Most vertebrates have ovaries Usually animals have two ovaries Birds usually have only one working ovary snakes have one ovary in front of the other The ovaries are similar to testicles in men

Ovaries are shaped like eggs and are around 3 cm by 15 cm by 15 cm The ovary is found in the side walls of the pelvis 

Each ovary is attached to the Fallopian tube Usually each ovary takes turns releasing eggs every month

Ovaries have two purposes

During menstruation a ovum is released from the ovary to be fertilised Ovaries have a certain number of eggs in them so when eggs stop being released this is the start of the menopause During this time female hormones stop being produced

Axe is an ancient tool used to shape split and cut wood

In the past axes were used as weapons by soldiers Today axes are usually related to woodcutters and firemen Axes are simple machines They are in the category of wedges They are usually made of some sort of metal mainly steel or iron They can have a metal or wooden handle 

A rhinoceros is any of five living species of mammals in the family Rhinocerotidae of the order Perissodactyla

All five rhinoceros species are native to Africa or Asia The two species in Africa are the White Rhinoceros and the Black Rhinoceros The three species in Asia are the Javan Rhinoceros Sumatran Rhinoceros and Indian Rhinoceros

The rhinoceros is an herbivore

Rhinoceroses have a large horn on the nose Their horns are not like those of other horned mammals the rhinoceros horn is made of keratin packed together very tightly 

Only the White Rhinoceros is not in critical danger of becoming extinct because of humans killing them even though it is illegal and the White Rhino in some danger of becoming extinct Loss of habitat is also a danger to all rhinos Rhinos are becoming extinct because people are still killing them for money even though the government made logging their habitat and poaching illegal Rhinoceros horns are used in Asian medicine and for dagger handles in Yemen and Oman which is leading to extinction of these animals

Alcoholic proof is a measure of how much ethanol there is in an alcoholic drink It is commonly used in the United States where it is about double the percentage of alcohol by volume

This system was introduced in the 18th century It might have been earlier when spirits were tested with gunpowder a mixture of water and alcohol proved itself when it could be poured on a small amount of gunpowder and still light up the wet powder If the powder did not ignite the mixture had too much water in it and the proof was considered low This process led to the nickname firewater given by Native Americans

A proven solution was defined as 100 degrees proof People have found out that this takes 5715 ethanol This value is still used as the British definition A simpler ratio to remember is seven to four 70 proof is 40 alcohol by volume

A hydrometer can be used to measure the precise proof of a spirit This test has gone through many formal changes

The European Union member nations have broadly adopted the recommendation of the International Organization of Legal Metrology which measures percentage of alcohol by volume at 20C

In Britain this replaced the Sikes hydrometer system which was used since 1816 although officially the Customs and Excise Act of 1952 defined spirits of proof strength

Previously Clarkes hydrometer had been used since the 1740s when Customs and Excise and London brewers and distillers began to use Clarkes hydrometer

In the definition of the United States the proof number is twice the percentage of the alcohol content measured by volume at a temperature of 60F Therefore 80 proof is 40 alcohol by volume If an 150 proof beverage is mixed half and half with water the drink is 75 proof

US Federal regulation requires that liquor labels state the percentage alcohol by volume The regulations permit a statement of the degrees proof as long as it is right next to the percentage alcohol by volume 

Alcohol is produced by yeast during the process of fermentation The other product of fermentation is carbon dioxide which is the gas that can make beer bottles explode or blow their tops off The amount of alcohol in the finished liquid depends on how much sugar there was at the beginning for the yeast to convert into alcohol In beer the alcohol is generally 3 to 12 and usually about 4 to 6 Depending on the strain of yeast wines top out at about 14 to 16 because that is the point in the fermentation process where the alcohol concentration denatures the yeast Since the 1990s a few alcohol tolerant superyeast strains have become commercially available which can ferment up to 20 

Very few microorganisms can live in alcoholic solutions The main three are yeast Brettanomyces and Acetobacter In what is essentially disinfection yeast keeps multiplying as long as there is sugar to eat gradually increasing the alcoholic content of the solution and killing off all other microorganisms and eventually themselves There are fortified wines with a higher alcohol concentration than that because stronger alcohol has been mixed with them

Stronger liquors are distilled after fermentation is complete to separate the alcoholic liquid from the remains of the grain fruit or whatever it was made from The idea of distillation is that a mixture of liquids is heated the one with the lowest boiling point will evaporate first and then the one with the next lowest boiling point and so on The catch is that water and alcohol form a mixture that has a lower boiling point than either one of them so what distills off first is that mixture that is 95 alcohol and 5 water Thus a distilled liquor cannot be stronger than 95 there are other techniques for separating liquids that can produce 100 ethanol but they are used only for scientific or industrial purposes 100 ethanol does not stay 100 for very long because it is hygroscopic and absorbs water out of the atmosphere

Acetobacter is a kind of bacteria These bacteria are known by their ability to change alcohol to acetic acid in the presence of air There are several species within this genus and there are other bacteria that can form acetic acid under different conditions but all of the Acetobacer are known by this ability

Acetobacter are important to people because

Sometimes Acetobacter is not wanted It can be killed by adding preservatives like Sulfur dioxides or by getting rid of the air when the wine is stored 

The Archbishop of Canterbury is the spiritual leader of the Church of England and the Anglican Communion He is the head of the Church and lives in the English city of Canterbury The Archbishop is chosen by the English monarch under guidance from senior bishops 

The office of Archbishop of Canterbury began in the year 597 In that year Saint Augustine came to England to the area called Kent He had been sent by the Pope to convince the local people to become Christians The people accepted him and Christianity when their King became a Christian Since then there has been an Archbishop at Canterbury in Kent

The Archbishop of Canterbury used to be head of the Roman Catholic Church in England but in the 1500s the English church broke away from the Roman church The new church called itself the Church of England and now the Archbishop is the leader of that church The current Archbishop is Rowan Williams the church however does not really speak ou much and is not really involved in the infasturucture of the uk

Ethanol also known as ethyl alcohol or grain alcohol is a flammable colorless chemical compound one of the alcohols that is most often found in alcoholic drinks When people talk about it they often name it simply as alcohol Its chemical formula is C2H5OH also written as C2H6O It is used as a solvent because it can dissolve many other chemicals and is not very toxic

Ethanol fuel can be used instead of gasoline in cars and other engines Engines can use pure ethanol or ethanol mixed with gasoline

In Brazil ethanol fuel made from sugar cane provides 18 percent of the countrys fuel for cars Because of this Brazil does not have to buy oil from other countries To do this Brazil cut down much of the rain forests to grow more sugar cane which is then fermented into Ethanol

Most cars in the US can run on fuels that have of up to 10 ethanol in them Car makers like Ford DaimlerChrysler and GM also make vehicles run that run higher ethanol blends Some of their engines can run on up to 85 ethanol By mid 2006 there were about six million E85 compatible vehicles on US roads

The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the substance boils or enters a state of rapid evaporation For water this is 100 Celsius or 212 Fahrenheit

One can change the boiling point of liquids by adding an inhibitor The change in boiling point can be found about right from

TBPKbm 

where TBP change in boiling point Kb a constant and m molality of the solute

The boiling point of a liquid also depends on the pressure of the surrounding air An increase in air pressure increases the boiling point a decrease decreases the boiling point In the low pressure environment at the top of Mt Everest for example water boils at only 69 C It can also be defined in terms of vapour pressure as the temperature at which vapour pressure of liquid becomes equal to atmospheric pressure

If you add sugar salt or any other impurities to the water it will usually make the boiling point higher An exception is alcohol which will have a lower boiling point

The following Platonic solids exist there are only 5

The shapes are often used to make dice because dice of these shapes can be made fair 6 sided dice are very common but the other numbers are commonly used in role playing games Such dice are commonly referred to as D followed by the number of faces

The tetrahedron cube and octahedron are found naturally in crystal structures The dodecahedron is combinatorially identical to the pyritohedron which is one of the possible crystal structures of pyrite However the pyritohedron is not a regular dodecahedron but rather has the same symmetry as the cube

In meteorology and climatology global numerical models of atmospheric flow are of increasing interest which use grids that are based on an icosahedron instead of the more commonly used longitudelatitude grid This has the advantage of better spatial resolution without singularities at the expense of somewhat greater numerical difficulty

Geometry of space frames is often based on platonic solids 

The Euclidean algorithm is an algorithm It can be used to find the biggest number that divides two other numbers

Euclid solved the problem graphically He said

Start out with two integers a and b Let m have the same value as a and n have the same value as b

A eukaryote is an organism with complex cells or a single cell with a complex structure 

In these cells the genetic material is organized into chromosomes in membrane bound nuclei 

Animals plants algae and fungi are all eukaryotes There are also eukaryotes amongst the protists 

In contrast simpler organisms such as bacteria and archaea do not have nuclei and other complex cell structures Such organisms are called prokaryotes 

The eukaryotes are often treated as a superkingdom or domain 

The oldest known eukaryote is Grypania a coiled unbranched filament up to 30mm long It was found in strata 21 billion years old Another ancient group is the acritarchs believed to be the cysts or reproductive stages of algal plankton They are found 1400 million years ago in the Proterozoic eonp57

Eukaryotic cells are usually much bigger than prokaryotes They can be up to 10 times bigger Eukaryote cells have many different internal membranes and structures called organelles They also have a cytoskeleton The cytoskeleton is made up of microtubules and microfilaments Those parts are very important in the cells shape Eukaryotic DNA is put in bundles called chromosomes which are separated by a microtubular spindle during cell division Most eukaryotes have some sort of sexual reproduction through fertilisation which prokaryotes do not use 

Prokayotes do not have sexes but they can pass DNA to other bacteria Their cell division is asexual Bacterial conjugation is when bacteria give each each DNA by touching each other or making something like a bridge to go between them 

Eukaryotes have sets of linear chromosomes located in the nucleus and the number of chromosomes is usually typical for each species

In eukaryotic cells there are many things with membranes around them All of them together are called the endomembrane system Simple bags called vesicles or vacuoles are sometimes made by budding off other membranes just like how children make bubbles with their toys Many cells take in food and other things using something called endocytosis In endocytosis the membrane closest to the outside bends inwards and then pinches off to make a vesicle Many other organelles that have membranes probably started off as vesicles

The nucleus is surrounded by two membranes membrane that has holes in it so things can go in and out The nuclear envelope has things sticking out of it that look like tubes and sheets These are called the endoplasmic reticulum which is often shortened to ER The ER is works with moving proteins around and allowing them to mature 

The ER has two parts the rough ER and the smooth ER The rough ER has ribosomes attached to it The proteins made by the ribosomes attached to the rough ER go to the inside the rough ER called the lumen After that they usually go into vesicles which grow and pinch off from the smooth ER In most eukaryotes the vesicles with proteins inside fuse with piles of flattened vesicles called the Golgi bodies where the proteins inside are changed again

Vesicles are sometimes changed so they can do one thing very well This is called specialization or differentiation For example lysosomes have enzymes inside them that break down the food the comes from food vacuoles and peroxisomes have enzymes that break down peroxide a poison so it is not poisonous anymore 

Many protozoa have contractile vacuoles which are vacuoles that can fuse or pinch off from the outer membrane Contractile vesicles are often used to get and get rid of unneeded water Extrusomes shoot out stuff that make predators go away or catch food In multicellular organisms hormones are often made in vesicles In the complicated plants most of the inside of a plant cell is taken up by a central vacuole That central vacuole is the main thing that keeps osmotic pressure so the cell can hold its shape

Because the cell organelles of eukaryotes have different origins the question arises as to whether the group is a unified clade or not It is certain that the protists are not Cell organelles are specialised units which carry out well defined functions like mitochondria and plastids It is fairly clear now that all or most of these organelles have their origin in once independent prokaryotes and that the eukaryote cell is a community of micro organisms working together in a marriage of convenience The first such events took place between ancient bacteria to produce the double membrane class known as gram negative bacteria Since the gram negative bacteria include the cyanobacteria this was the first of several such events in the history of the eukaryotes

Protista is a group of different single celled organisms More accurate taxonomies have been proposed but scientists are still discussing them For this reason Protista is still useful for talking about these organisms One modern scheme for the classification of the Eukarya is as follows 

The implication of this might be that the Eukarya are only unified in the fact that the cells are a community derived from bacteria and archaea but the derivations vary The conclusion may be that like the Protista the Eukarya is a polyphyletic assembly though a useful one However as mentioned above all branches of the Eukarya have sexual reproduction That and the general organisation of the nucleus are defining features It is on this that the issue of monophyletic origin rests

Unicellular organisms are organisms that have one cell They are divided into two quite different types from different classification kingdoms 

The differences between the prokaryota and eukaryota are significant Eukaryotes possess a nucleus while prokaryotes lack it and eukaryotes possess a range of subcellular organs called organelles which prokaryotes do not

You can observe the larger unicellular organisms balal by using a compound microscope Bacteria just appear as dark dots To gather unicellular organisms for observation one can place a cover slip on the surface of pond water and leave it overnight By the next morning numerous unicellular organisms will have grown entire colonies on the bottom of the slip piskeyys are sms replicate fast colonies can double their size in between 30 minutes and a few hours

Unicellular organisms can be found everywhere The oldest forms of life unicellular organisms existed 38 billion years ago if not longer They pursue a variety of strategies for survival photosynthesis chemotrophy and heterotrophy Some unicellular organisms have flagella little tails they use for locomotion or lobopods extensions of the cellular skeleton which appear as bloblike arms The flagella of our unicellular ancestors is retained all the way up into the animals where it makes an appearance as flagellated sperm

Of all the six eukaryote supergroups four are exclusively composed of unicellular organisms Unicellular organisms vary in size with the smallest bacteria measuring only a third of a micron across ranging up to the titantic plasmodial slime molds which can grow to 20 cm across The largest unicellular organisms may have millions of nuclei scattered throughout the cellular envelope To observe some of the smallest unicellular organisms requires an electron microscope while the very largest can be seen with a microscope or anything that enhances images meh

Multicellular organisms are organisms with more than one cell This is the case for most animals and plants that can be seen 

In such organisms cells are usually specialised All the cells with the same function group together Such a group of cells is then called a tissue

Multicellular organisms have a set of cells that specialize in reproduction Reproduction in such organisms is usually sexual The sex cells are either sperm or ovum cells If they are sperm cells the organism is male if they are egg cells it is female If both are present the organism is a hermaphrodite

We know from their cell structure that multicellularity has evolved independently many times in Earth history for example in plants and animals However the earliest forms of life in the fossil record are cyanobacteria from the Archaean era at 35 billion years ago They grew as single cells but lived in colonies as stromatolites 

The first multicellular fossils have been found in 21 billion years old Palaeoproterozoic rocks from the Gabon in Africa These are eukaryotic cells which live colonially The fossils are visible to the naked eye and hence much larger than bacteria The authors comment that one advantage of multicellularity is larger size and that an adequate level of oxygen is required to support this kind of life 

The authors interpretation of this discovery will be tested by other scientists

In order to reproduce true multicellular organisms must solve the problem of regenerating a whole organism from germ cells an issue that is studied in developmental biology 

Multicellular organisms especially long living animals also face the challenge of cancer which occurs when cells fail to regulate their growth within the normal program of development Changes in tissue morphology can be observed during this process

Kazan State University is a university in Kazan Tatarstan Russia It was founded in 1804 The famous Russian mathematician Lobachevsky was its rector from 1827 till 1846 The current rector is Myakzyum Salakhov

Kazan University is also known as the birthplace of organic chemistry because of the works of Aleksandr Butlerov Vladimir Markovnikov Aleksandr Arbuzov and others

Louis Pasteur was a French microbiologist and chemist He and also his wife Marie are best known for their experiments supporting the Germ theory of disease and he is also known for his vaccinations most notably the first vaccine against rabies He made many discoveries in the field of chemistry most notably the asymmetry of crystals He is also well known for his way of keeping milk and wine from going sour for longer That process is called pasteurization

Pasteurs later work on diseases included work on chicken cholera During this work Pasteur noticed how a culture of the responsible bacteria had spoiled and it failed to induce the disease in some chickens which he was infecting with the disease

Louis Pasteur was born on December 27 1822 in Dole in the Jura region of France into the family of a poor tanner Louis grew up in the town of Arbois He gained degrees in Letters and in Mathematical Sciences before entering the cole Normale Suprieure an elite college After serving briefly as professor of physics at Dijon Lyce in 1848 he became professor of chemistry at the University of Strasbourg where he met and courted Marie Laurent daughter of the universitys rector in 1849

Louis Pasteur and Marie were married on May 29 1849 and together had five children Only two survived to adulthood his other three children had died of typhoid fever These personal tragedies inspired Pasteur to try to find cures for diseases such as typhoid

Akrotiri and Dhekelia are two areas on the island of Cyprus that are used as military bases of the United Kingdom The bases were kept by the UK after Cyprus changed from being a colony in the British Empire to being an independent republic The United Kingdom kept them because of the important location of Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea

Kurw is a village in south eastern Poland near Puawy and Lublin on the Kurwka River It is the main village of a gmina within the Lublin Voivodship and has 2826 people living there The village was built before 1185 and made bigger between 1431 and 1442 with city rights based on the Magdeburg Law The former President of Poland Wojciech Jaruzelski was born in Kurw in 1923

Scorpions are eight legged venomous arachnids They have a long body with an extended tail with a sting The average adult scorpion reaches approximately 3 inches in length The longest scorpion on earth is the African Scorpion which can reach a total length of 9 inches There are over 1300 species of scorpions worldwide

Scorpions have developed many ways to survive in the desert They have developed the ability to slow down their metabolism This allows them to survive on as little as one insect per year This ability also allows them to shelter from the sun and heat for extended periods of time using only little amounts of oxygen Many people also believe that their claws or pincers were once front legs that have turned into what they now are by going through evolution Nevertheless the scorpions claws play a crucial part in their hunting and mating rituals Scorpions also possess a special feather like pair of organs called pectines that they use to sense even the smallest of movements around them This allows them to effectively track down and hunt their prey either above or below the surface This also warns them of possible dangers such as other bigger hunters The scorpions most feared and recognized feature is its sting The sting contains a neurotoxin which the scorpion uses to paralyze the victim so it would be easier to kill and eat They also stay hidden under rocks and that makes their body temperature cool

The scorpions body is divided into two parts the prosoma and the abdomen which is further divided into the mesosoma and the metasoma which are both surrounded by the cuticle

This is the scorpions head the carapace the eyes the mouthparts the claws and four legs 

The front half of the abdomen is made up of six segments The first segment contains the sexual organs and the other organs which are used in the scorpions mating ritual The second segment contains the feather like pectines which are used to sense movement in the air and ground The final four segments each contain a pair of book lungs which are the lungs found in arachnids the mesosoma is armored by an extra layer This extra layer is made up of chitinous plates which are the plates usually found in the cell walls of fungi and the exoskeletons of insects and arachnids

This is the scorpions tail and the second half of its abdomen A scorpions sting is made up of six segments ending in the telson or the sting The telson itself holds the vesicle which is the gland containing the scorpions venom The scorpions venom is classified as neurotoxic in nature This means that it can be used to either kill or paralyze the victim The general rule is that the smaller the claws of the scorpion the more deadly the venom is as scorpions with deadly venoms do not need their claws while those with not so deadly venom need to rely on their claws more so they are bigger and stronger

This is the scorpions tough exterior It is partially covered by hairs that help the scorpion keep balance The cuticle is also covered by hyaline layer which makes them fluoresce green when exposed to ultraviolet light This layer does not appear on newly molted scorpions appearing only on hardened and matured cuticles This hyaline layer can be found intact inside fossils that are millions of years old

The mating ritual of scorpions begins when the male and female connect claws After this they verify that the other scorpion is of the same species and is the opposite gender After this the male leads the female around until it finds a suitable spot to deposit its spermatophore Once the male has found a suitable spot he guides the female over it where it enters her and fertilizes her The mating ritual can take anywhere between 1 and 26 hours depending on the males ability to find a suitable spot Only a scorpion that has reached maturity may go through the mating ritual A scorpion reaches maturity after it has gone through 5 to 7 moults

Computability theory is part of computer science Scientists want to know what can be computed and what can not 

There is a model of a computer that is used for this It is called the Turing machine A Turing machine basically is a special typewriter with an endless ribbon The machine is named after the mathematician Alan Turing

A problem is computable if it can be expressed in such a way that a Turing machine can solve it 

One of the best known examples is the Halting problem The task is to write a program which says for all programs whether they will finally stop This is impossible to decide Mathematicians say the problem is undecidable

Nocturnal animals are animals that are mainly active during the night They hunt or feed during the night and sleep during the day Diurnal animals do it the other way around

Scientists sometimes use the word crepuscular to describe nocturnal animals that are not active when it is very dark at night they are mostly active near dawn dusk and sometimes when the moon makes a lot of light 

Nocturnal animals also have a high sensitivity to their eyes and when flashed really brightly with lights appear red orange amber or topaz

Censorship is when certain facts changed or left out on purpose It is the suppression of speech or deletion of communicative material which may be considered objectionable harmful sensitive or inconvenient to the government or media organizations as determined by a censor This can be done for different reasons Most often things are censored for one or more of the following reasons

A censor is a person whose job is to look at all types of media and remove material There are many reasons to censor something like protecting military secrets stopping immoral or anti religious works or keeping political power Censorship is almost always used as an insult and there is much debate over what censorship is and when it is okay

When there is freedom of speech and freedom of the press most information can published However even in developed countries with much freedom of the press there are some things that cannot be published For example journalists are usually not allowed to publish many secrets about the military like where troops will be sent on a mission Pornography is censored in some countries because it is seen as not moral For these reasons the government might arrest anyone who publishes it 

There is much debate about when censorship should be allowed For example US President Richard Nixon censored the New York Times when they tried to publish articles about the Pentagon Papers a group of classified military documents that showed that Nixon and the military lied about the Vietnam War The Supreme Court in New York Times Co v United States overturned the censorship saying that Nixon had not shown it would be dangerous to the military just embarrassing In other countries journalists and bloggers are sometimes arrested for saying bad things about the government In Egypt Kareem Amer was famously arrested for insulting Islam and calling the president of Egypt Hosni Mubarak a dictator 

Governments are not the only ones who censor information For example when the history department at Middlebury College did not allow professors to accept Wikipedia as a source in papers some said it was censorship This was because the department was telling professors what works they should and should not accept Sometimes a group or a website will not allow some facts articles and pictures that they do not think should be seen There is much debate over the difference between censorship and editing that is deciding what should or should not be published

Volleyball is a sport with six players on each team separated by a net Each team is allowed six substitution players The game starts when the captain from each team decides which side of the court they will play on by the toss of a coin which also determines who will serve the ball first The point of the game is to keep the ball in the air The ball can be played with any part of the body with a maximum of three strokes a team

In 1895 William G Morgan invented a new game called Mintonette However when an observer named Alfred Halstead saw the game being played he couldnt help but notice the volleying action used to get the ball over the net so he decided to change the name to volleyball 

A player cannot hit the ball twice A point is gained when a team plays the ball in the oppositions court and the ball is not defended therefore it lands within the court The ball must be served from outside the court otherwise it will be regarded as a foul The game is played in sets of 25 points The team that reaches 25 points first wins the set Each game consists of 3 5 sets The fifth set is played until 15 points A player usually wears kneepads to protect their knees from becoming bruised during dives for the volleyball In order to win the game you must be ahead by two points or the game goes on until you win by 2 points

The sports governing body is the FIVBDigging is the ability to prevent the ball from touching ones court after a spike or attack particularly a ball that is nearly touching the ground Usually the player is diving to be the barrier to block the ball from hitting the courtIn many aspects this skill is similar to passing or bumping overhand dig and bump are also used to distinguish between defensive actions taken with fingertips or with joined arms Some specific techniques are more common in digging than in passing A player may sometimes perform a dive ie throw his or her body in the air with a forward movement in an attempt to save the ball and land on his or her chest When the player also slides his or her hand under a ball that is almost touching the court this is called a pancake The pancake is frequently used in indoor volleyball Besides being one of the best known sports in the world and being a favorite to millions of people it is in the Olympics

The Great Depression was the great economic crisis that is said to have been started because of the US stock market crash in 1929 The prices on the Wall Street stock market fell a lot from October 24 to October 29 1929 Many people lost their jobs By 1932 2530 of people lost their jobs They became homeless and poor This ended the wealth of the Roaring Twenties Many people think that the Great Depression started on Black Tuesday but Black Tuesday was just an underlying problem that would help cause the Depression

From 1929 1932 the depression worsened Many suspect that increased taxes on American citizens and the increased tariffs worsened it Economist Milton Friedman said that the Great Depression was worsened because the Federal Reserve printed out less money than usual

When the Great Depression started Herbert Hoover was the president of the United States and as a result he was blamed for it People voted for a new president in 1932 His name was Franklin D Roosevelt Roosevelt got the government to pass many new laws and programs to help people who were hurt by the Great Depression These programs were called the New Deal One of these programs was the Civilian Conservation Corps or CCC The CCC put many young men to work in the outdoors The men were paid 1 dollar a week to work and they got free food and shelter Another one of these programs was called Social Security Social Security gave old people a small income so they had money for things they needed The Great Depression was really bad but with everyones help it would get better Between 1939 and 1944 more people had jobs again because of World War II and the Great Depression came to an end

An important reason for the Great Depression was the Treaty of Versailles The Treaty of Versailles made the United States very rich Britain and France both gave large amounts of money to the US and Germany had to pay a great amount of money for the damage they had done in World War I However it was this wealth that began the stock market crash

Even after the Wall Street Crash of 1929 people still had hope John D Rockefeller said that These are days when many are discouraged In the 93 years of my life depressions have come and gone Prosperity has always returned and will again But soon the bad effects of the depression grew worse and worse People lost jobs money and homes There were reports that in Germany and the United States there was great hunger disease and even starvation And everuone died of poorness because they were poor and they wernt happy because they couldnt get money out of thier bank accounts and they hated the government

In previous depressions farmers were usually safe from the severe effects of a depression because they could at least feed themselves Unfortunately during the Great Depression the Great Plains were hit hard with both a drought and horrendous dust storms

Years and years of overgrazing combined with the effects of a drought caused the grass to disappear With just topsoil exposed high winds picked up the loose dirt and whirled it for miles The dust storms destroyed everything in their paths leaving farmers without their crops

Small farmers were hit especially hard Even before the dust storms hit the invention of the tractor drastically cut the need for manpower on farms These small farmers were usually already in debt borrowing money for seed and paying it back when their crops came in When the dust storms damaged the crops not only could the small farmer not feed himself and his family he could not pay back his debt Banks would then foreclose on the small farms and the farmers family would be both homeless and unemployed

The clitoris is a female genital organ that includes erectile tissue glands muscles and ligaments nerves and blood vessels Although the parts are placed differently the clitoris is matching to the male penis The clitoris functions to cause sexual pleasure and create orgasms as well as make a woman aroused

During sexual arousal the clitoris grows as its erectile tissue fills with blood until orgasm happens Also during arousal touching the clitoris and other sensitive areas of the female genitals makes a womans vagina change shape and release a lubricant The lubricant and change of shape makes it easier for a man to enter a woman and for sex to occur Most of the clitoris is hidden inside the body and only a small part can be seen from the outside Adding the outside and inside parts the clitoris is similar in size to the penis The clitoris and penis grow out of the same tissue in the womb They share many similar parts

The parts of the clitoris that can be seen from the outside stretch from the clitoral junction the point where the outer lips meet at the base of the pubic mound to the fork where the lower edges of the inner lips meet below the vaginal opening The outside parts include

The Berlin Wall separated the city of Berlin in Germany from 1961 to 1989 It separated the eastern half from the western half Many people thought it was a symbol of the Cold War The Berlin Wall was taken down on November 9 1989 The Berlin Wall was about 168 km long It was built to prevent people from escaping from the eastern half of Berlin

After World War II ended Germany was divided into four zones one zone for each of the main Allied countries France the United Kingdom the United States and the Soviet Union Its capital Berlin was also divided into four zones so that it was like an island inside the Soviet zone In May 1949 the French United Kingdom and US zones were made into West Germany The Soviet zone was made into East Germany in retaliation for the Western powers splitting Germany East Germany German Democratic Republic was founded on October 7 1949

Austria was also divided into four zones In 1955 a treaty was signed The treaty said that the Allied forces must leave Austria In return the Austrian government promised to do certain things like not form a territorial union with Germany recognise certain minorities amongst others The whole of Europe was separated into a Soviet Union zone in the East and a US dominated zone in the West The splitting of Europe Germany and especially Berlin into two political blocks was part of the Cold War between the United States of America and other western countries on one side and the Soviet Union and its allies on the other The wartime Allied Forces split after their common enemy Nazi Germany was defeated in May 1945

After Germany split into West and East Germany in 1949 26 million East Germans left to go to West Germany In Berlin alone 16 million people fled to the west To stop this on August 13 1961 the Communist government of East Germany built a wall separating East and West Berlin

The wall was built to keep the countrys people in But the Soviets and East German government said it was to keep capitalism out They said that West Germany refused to recognize East Germany as an independent country because they wanted to take over North East Germany just like Hitler took over Poland

People still tried to escape even though the Berlin Wall was there They used many methods to get around the guards and barbed wire on the Berlin Wall

In the late 1980s Mikhail Gorbachev said that the Soviet Union would not stop the people of Eastern and Middle Europe from changing their government by using military force After he said that several countries began to change the way they governed their people Hungary opened its border and people from East Germany began moving to the west through Hungary In October 1989 mass demonstrations against the government in East Germany began The long time leader Erich Honecker resigned and was replaced by Egon Krenz a few days later Honecker had predicted in January 1989 that the wall would stand for a hundred more years if the conditions which had caused its construction did not change This did not turn out to be true

In November 1989 the Central Committee of East Germany decided to make it easier for East Germans to pass through the wall A mistake by the press officer meant the border was opened several hours before it should have been Millions of East German citizens celebrated the opening of the wall Many collected souvenirs with chisels and some television stations filmed people hitting the wall with sledge hammers

This image of people in West Berlin hitting the wall is often said to be East Berliners breaking out This is not true The eastern side of the wall had no graffiti on it All pictures of people chipping away at the wall show people hitting graffiti covered walls Less than one year after the Berlin Wall was broken down Germany again became one country ImageBerlin satellite image with Berlin walljpgSatellite image of Berlin The yellow line is where the Wall was ImageKarte berliner mauer enjpgWhere the Berlin Wall was inside Berlin ImageBerlinleavingjpgPanel at the border of the sector boundary in Berlin ImageBerlin enteringjpgSame panel other side 

In the 28 years of its existence between 125 and 206 people were killed when trying to cross the Berlin Wall At least 800 more people were killed outside Berlin trying to cross from East Germany to the west

The East Germans did not record all of the deaths so the real number of how many people died may never be known

Those people who were caught alive in an attempt to flee had to go to jail for at least five years The first victim of the Wall was Ida Siekmann She was fatally injured after jumping out of the window of her apartment She fell onto the pavement on the west side The first victim of the Wall to be shot at was Gnter Litfin He was 24 years old and was shot by police near the railway station of Berlin Friedrichstrasse when he tried to get into the West This was on 24 August 1961 only eleven days after the border had been closed

Peter Fechter bled to death in the death strip on 17 August 1962 This led to a public outcry American troops watched him but could not help him The East German border policemen who had wounded him did not help him either

In 1966 two children aged ten and thirteen years were killed in the border strip This is unusual because the East German border police had orders to not shoot on pregnant women children or mentally ill people

The last death took place on 6 February 1989 when Chris Gueffroy died trying to escape into West Berlin

The wall was changed and added to several times It was not really a wall but a collection of walls and fences and other devices This is what the border fence was made of starting from the east going west

The whole was done in an a zone of between 30 and 500 m wide The official began before the first fence Entering the installation required a special permit The real border was about one or two metres in front of the concrete wall so that the whole of the wall complex was inside East Germany

The border between East Germany and West Germany was also heavily defended with fences and mines East Germans needed a special permit to live close to the border

The East Berlin people who guarded the wall had the order to shoot if this was necessary to stop people fleeing East German leaders such as Egon Krenz were arrested after German Reunification because guards were ordered to shoot to kill

However after the Wall was built many people were no longer able to leave East Berlin using normal border posts The only way they could do so was to race through the Wall or try to dig a tunnel underneath

After the unification of Germany border guards who had shot people were convicted by West German Courts The judges said that some of the laws of the border police were against human rights They therefore should have refused to shoot

The same was of course applied to those people who had shot border police on their flight

Border guards who did shoot and stop someone from fleeing could get a reward of up to 500 Marks Some of those guards were sentenced after the unification

The other choice was to not shoot or to miss badly Such guards risked losing their well paid jobs

Another strip of land was given to West Berlin This strip was only the width of a road which joined West Berlin with a tiny exclave

Nutmeg is a genus of an evergreen trees They are found in tropical Southeast Asia and Australia From the fruit of the tree two spices are made

Pulau Run is an island in Indonesia It is one of the smallest Islands of the Banda Islands It is about 3 km long and less than 1 km wide

It used to be of great importance because of the value of the spices nutmeg and mace Both spices are from the same tree The trees were only grown on the Banda Islands During the history of the spice trade sailors of the British East India Company of the second expedition of James Lancaster John Davis and John Middleton who stayed in Bantam on Java first reached the Island in 1603 They made good contacts with the people who lived there

Two wars were fought over the extremely costly spices 

The Treaty of Westminster ended the First Anglo Dutch War of 16521654 According to the treaty Run should have been returned to England The first attempt in 1660 failed due to formal constraints by the Dutch after the second in 1665 the English traders were expelled in the same year and the Dutch destroyed the nutmeg trees

After the second Anglo Dutch War of 16651667 England and the United Provinces of the Netherlands agreed in the Treaty of Breda to the status quo The English kept the island of Manhattan which the Duke of York had occupied illegally in 1664 and renamed from New Amsterdam to New York and Run was officially given to the Dutch Even though the Dutch monopoly on nutmeg and mace was destroyed by the transfer of nutmeg trees to Ceylon Singapore and other British colonies in 1817 after the capture of the main Island Bandalontor in 1810 by Captain Cole leading to the decline of the Dutch supremacy in the spice trade there are still nutmeg trees growing on Run today

A hierarchy is a way of ranking and organizing things or people Beneath the top of the hierarchy each part of it is below some other part

This turns out to be like a pyramid There is a single person or thing at the top level 

An example with people would be the structure of a company There is the top manager and there are a few levels of middle and lower management At the bottom are the common workers Another example would be an army that might have a general followed by colonels corporals and sergeants then privates 

In these examples people who are higher up have more authority and power than people below them

The Finnish language is a Finno Ugric language a group of languages belonging to the Uralic language family It is one of the two official languages of Finland It is also an official minority language in Sweden Finnish is one of the four national languages of Europe that is not an Indo European language The other three are Estonian and Hungarian which are also Uralic languages and Basque

The Finnish grammar and most Finnish words are very different from those in other European languages because Finnish is not an Indo European language The two other national languages that are Uralic languages as Finnish are Estonian and Hungarian Estonian and Finnish are very close to each other and Estonians and Finns usually may understand each other Even though Finnish and Hungarian are related languages they do not look or sound similar The Finnish and Hungarian languages separated a long time ago and each language developed its own vocabulary People who can speak Finnish cannot understand Hungarian without extra study and Hungarians cannot understand Finnish However there are some basic words that are very similar for example hand to go fish Finnish kala vs Hungarian hal

Finnish is a synthetic and an agglutinative language This means that words in Finnish have a stem called body and many parts inside them that make up meaning Finnish is similar in this respect as Japanese language and Turkish language and Latin language In Finnish there are 15 cases A case is an ending added to a word that helps describe its purpose in the sentence

Sleep is a state of rest which happens in animals including humans Animals that sleep are in an unconscious state or mostly so Most of the muscles that animals can control on purpose are inactive Animals that are asleep do not react to stimuli as fast as those that are awake They can wake up from sleep more easily than from hibernation or coma All mammals and birds and many reptiles amphibians and fish sleep In humans other mammals and most other animals that were studied sleeping regularly is essential for survival

The purpose of sleep is not fully known and it is still studied today We do know for sure though that sleep is necessary to most animals for survival Not having enough sleep can even be used for torture

A person sleeps when he or she is not awake Usually this is during the night During the day most people are awake They work go to school or university or do other things Many people sleep for a short time in the early afternoon for a quick rest This is called a nap

The word sleep comes from the old Old Germanic verbs for sleep In Old and Middle High German it was called SLAF The original meaning of the word was to slap which was related to the word for flabby

Many words related to sleep have very different meanings though For example sleep was also used to mean death so that putting an animal to sleep meant to kill the animal without pain Sleep with someone can also have a sexual meaning

Generally the reason for sleep is that the brain has work to do during sleep The details are not fully understood but it is important to get enough sleep for the body and the brain to be healthy and work properly Usually animals sleep at periodic intervals such as once a day Certain animals send out signals to the others that they will soon go to sleep Yawning is such a signal

Both humans and many animals sleep about once a day Some animals such as cats sleep many times a day for short periods

When people sleep they often have dreams Probably some animals do too

Not only people sleep all mammals and birds and most fish reptiles and other animals do too

In mammals and birds sleep can be divided into two categories In one of them the eyes move rapidly It is called REM sleep Most dreams take place in this phase REM sleep occurs normally at intervals throughout the night and the periods of REM sleep increase in length in the second half of the night REM sleep was first discovered in 1952 53

The other category where this movement of the eyes does not happen is called NREM sleep Usually dreams do not occur during this time There are three or four stages of NREM sleep Stage I is just barely sleeping or dozing Stage II is also light sleep Normally in adult humans about half of the time spent asleep is spent in light sleep Stages III and IV are called deep sleep Deep sleep is necessary for growth and healing It can be quite difficult to awaken someone who is in stage III or stage IV sleep Sometimes stages III and IV are combined and called stage III

Adult humans normally sleep in cycles of 90 to 110 minutes each The nights sleep can be 4 or 5 of these cycles Each cycle includes in this order stage I stage II stage III stage II and REM

The timing of sleep and the amount of it are both important Both are different for different people Some adults sleep best from 2200 to 0500 or 0600 or 0700 Some sleep best from midnight to seven or eight These variations are normal

How much sleep is enough also depends on age Children need more sleep than adults Newborn babies sleep about 18 hours per day Small babies sleep many times a day human babies do not develop circadian rhythms before they are 3  4 months old At the age of 1 year they sleep for about 14 hours 

A nine year old should sleep about 9 10 hours per day and teenagers too need that much sleep Adults who sleep less than about 8 hours a day perform worse than those who sleep that long 

People may have trouble going to sleep staying asleep or getting enough sleep This usually means that they are too sleepy in the daytime

There are many things that influence sleep Also some substances called stimulants  coffee is such an example  can cause poor sleep When people have just eaten something the body is busy digesting This can cause poor sleep too Worrying and stress can cause poor sleep 

There are many diseases that cause poor sleep Fever can lead to bad dreams Poor sleep can be a side effect of some medications 

Sleep disorders directly influence how a person sleeps Examples of sleep disorders are narcolepsy sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep disorders

Flash memory is a memory storage device for computers and electronics It is most often used in devices like digital cameras USB flash drives and video games It is quite similar to EEPROM

Flash memory is different from RAM because RAM is volatile When power is turned off RAM loses all its data Flash can keep its data intact with no power at all A hard drive also is permanent storage but it is bulky and fragile Flash memory is much slower than RAM or hard drives But it is great for small electronics because it is small and it has no moving parts

The main weakness of flash memory is the number of times that data can be written to it Data can be read from flash as many times as desired but after a certain number of write operations it will stop working Most flash devices are designed for about 100000  1000000 write operations

EEPROM has the same limitation that flash does it can only survive about 100000 write cycles But it is more expensive than flash so it is usually not used for storage greater than 128kB The main difference between EEPROM and flash memory is that EEPROM can write to any byte of memory at any time Flash memory can only write to an entire chunk or sector of memory at a time That means that if the user wants to change only one byte flash must also re write all the bytes in that sector This means that flash memory can wear out faster than EEPROM

Sren Aabye Kierkegaard a 19th century Danish philosopher and theologian is usually thought of as the first existentialist philosopher 

He wrote many philosophical books about faith existence emotions and feelings He disliked people who tried to make Christianity political and people who tried to limit the single individual in favour of groups of many people Many people have found his works interesting and have said that they were great works of philosophy Ludwig Wittgenstein a 20th century philosopher thought Kierkegaard was by far the most profound thinker of the nineteenth century

He was born in Copenhagen Denmark He attended Copenhagen University and earned his masters degree in 1841 During this time he met and fell in love with Regine Olsen in 1837 Although they were engaged for a time Kierkegaard ended the engagement in 1841

After breaking up with Regine he spent much of his time writing book after book in a highly dramatic yet subtle way He also wrote some of his works using pen names or pseudonyms Although his works were not very popular during his lifetime after his death his works grew in popularity and became highly influential in the 20th and 21st centuries

Ketchup is a kind of thick liquid sauce It is made from tomatoes so it is sometimes called tomato sauce Usually it is used to add flavour to food Some people like to eat sausages burgers hotdogs or fishsticks with ketchup Ketchup tastes very unlike the real tomato

Although todays ketchup is tomato based it did not appear until about a century after other types By 1801 a recipe for tomato ketchup was created by Sandy Addison It was later printed in an American cookbook the Sugar House Book James Mease published another recipe in 1812 In 1824 a ketchup recipe using tomatoes appeared in The Virginia Housewife This was an important 19th century cookbook written by Mary Randolph Thomas Jeffersons cousin

As the century went on tomato ketchup became more popular in the United States More Americans began to like tomatoes Tomato ketchup was sold locally by farmers A man named Jonas Yerks is believed to have been the first man to make tomato ketchup a national phenomenon By 1837 he had produced and distributed the condiment nationally Shortly after that other companies did the same F J Heinz created their tomato ketchup in 1876 Heinz tomato ketchup was advertised Blessed relief for Mother and the other women in the household

The Websters Dictionary of 1913 defined catchup as a table sauce made from mushrooms tomatoes walnuts etc Written also ketchup

Modern ketchup emerged in the early years of the 20th century This came from a debate over the use of sodium benzoate as a preservative in condiments Harvey W Wiley challenged the safety of benzoate In response business owners particularly Henry J Heinz pursued a different recipe that did not use that preservative

Prior to Heinz commercial tomato ketchups of that time were watery and thin This was due to the use of unripe tomatoes Those tomatoes were low in pectin They were less vinegary than modern ketchups By pickling ripe tomatoes the need for benzoate was eliminated There was also no spoiled ketchup or loss in flavor The changes also helped make it an important American condiment according to some experts

Until Heinz most commercial ketchups appealed to two of the basic tastes bitterness and saltiness But the switch to ripe tomatoes and more tomato solids added a stronger umami taste The major increase in the concentration of vinegar added sourness and pungency to the range of sensations experienced while eating it 

In the past ketchup was produced from fresh tomatoes after harvesting Vacuum evaporation made it possible to turn tomatoes into a very thick tomato paste This made it easy to store at room temperature This allows a factory to produce ketchup throughout the year

In fast food chains ketchup is often put in small packets that hold ketchup inside Users tear the side or top of the packet They then squeeze the ketchup out of the ketchup packets In 2010 Heinz is offering an alternate squeeze and dip cup This is meant to offer a cleaner method of dispensing the product

In an earlier approach some fast food outlets dispense ketchup from pumps into paper cups Some restaurants still use this method

In October 2000 Heinz introduced colored ketchup products called EZ Squirt They included green purple pink orange teal and blue colored ketchup These products were made by adding food coloring to the traditional ketchup As of2006altAs of January 2006 these products have been discontinued

Carnival is a public celebration which takes place in many cities and towns in many countries around the world in February or March each year Carnival can sometimes last for several weeks In some places there is only one day of celebration There are often street parades bands costumes and many people wear masks Carnival is linked to religious traditions in the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches and it is also linked to the folk traditions in every different place where it happens 

Many Christian churches have a 40 day season of fasting called Lent in which Christians prepare for Easter which is one of the two most important feasts in the Christian year Easter is in late March or April Lent always begins on a Wednesday which is called Ash Wednesday in February or March On that day many people go to church and have some ash smeared on their forehead as a sign of sorrow for their sins Then for 40 days they try to work hard on improving themselves and thinking about the teachings of Jesus It is usual for people to give up something for Lent They might stop smoking or stop watching TV so they can spend more time reading the Bible or talking with the family Many people give up all their favourite foods and have no cake wine beer chocolate icecream or other luxury foods 

The name carnivale comes from Italian and means putting aside the flesh This means that during Lent people were not to think about their flesh but do things that were good for their souls The word flesh also means meat so many people would eat no meat during Lent

Mardi Gras means Fat Tuesday This was the day just before Lent The first day of Lent was called Mecredi Meagre meaning Mean Wednesday

During the Middle Ages in Europe it was normal for people to have a big feast on the Tuesday before the Lenten fast started In many towns this developed into a big public party with entertainment in the town square There is a famous painting by Pieter Bruegel dating from the 1550s and showing the Battle of Carnival and Lent 

About Pieter Bruegels famous painting 

In this picture by Pieter Bruegel a man representing Carnival is pushed on a barrel by people in costumes and masks He is about to do battle with Lent His weapon is a skewer covered with pieces of roast meat He balances a blackbird pie on his head Lent who is very skinny fights him with two little fish on a bread board The person at the front wears a mask and plays a very noisy instrument called a rummelpott

Nowadays many cities and towns around the world celebrate Carnival for a week or more The final day of the celebration is Mardi Gras when there is often a parade In some cities the Mardi Gras parade is held on the weekend before Lent begins rather than on the Tuesday so as not to disturb the business and traffic of the town 

In some towns such as the Belgian town of Binche the preparations for the Carnival are complex and start many weeks before Carnival takes place with most of the towns people taking part in some way The Carnival of Binche is listed with UNESCO as an event of great historic importance because it has been held there in almost the same way for more than 500 years 

Carnival is celebrated differently around the world but there are some things that are similar 

In the Carneval of Rio de Janeiro which is one of the biggest and most famous in the world a major feature is the glamorous costumes as both men and women wear bright colours and wonderful headdresses to dance down the street to the sound of many bands In Rio there are many very large and expensive decorated floats

In New Orleans the bands are one of the most important parts of the Carnival celebrations In Dsseldorf in Germany one of the features of the Carnival parades are the enormous models of politicians and other well known people In Sydney the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardis Gras which started out as a parade for Sydneys homosexual community now includes exhibitions live theatre and competitions and stretches over two weeks 

In Venice the Carnival was celebrated from December 26 until Lent began During that time people were allowed to disguise themselves by wearing masks in the street In the 1930s this was forbidden by the Italian Government but in 1980 a mask makers shop was set up in Venice again Soon the old tradition was brought back and now many people dress in costume and wear masks for two weeks before Lent begins 

In Brussels in Belgium the main Carnival procession is held in the Grande Place the town square in front of the Gothic Town Hall with its huge tower Every part of the procession is ruled by a tradition but some of the traditions are so old that no one remembers what they mean anymore At the beginning of the procession is a large group of people dressed in beautiful costumes of silk and velvet who act out an historic scene of the coming of the King of Spain and his royal court to Brussels 500 years ago When they have taken their seats there comes an amazing procession which includes stilt walkers fire eaters Goldilocks with a dancing bear a mad camel a wizard lots of men in huge feathery headdresses and the Archangel Michael whose job is to frighten the Devil These characters are traditional to Brussels In every city the characters that take part are different

Although the word carnival still has its old meaning it is often used to mean public entertainments of different kinds Some towns have carnivals that have nothing to do with Lent and are at different times of year Nowadays there are all sorts of different carnivals Some of these carnivals like the Notting Hill Carnival in London and the Melbourne Cup Racing Carnival in Australia are very famous 

The word carnival is now used for festivals parades and competitions of all sorts There are school sports carnivals folk carnivals multi cultural carnivals horse racing carnivals wine and food carnivals and boating carnivals 

Fasting is a kind of abstinence It is when someone does not eat or drink for some specified period of time It is only the case if the person does so of his or her own will It may also be that the person only eats and drinks certain kinds of food Most often fasting is done for religious reasons Depending on the tradition fasting practices may forbid sexual intercourse masturbation as well as refraining from eating certain types or groups of food

Fasting for religious and spiritual reasons has been a part of human custom since pre history It is mentioned in the Quran in the Mahabharata in the Upanishads and in the Bible in both the Old and New Testament

In almost all cases there are exceptions for observing the fasting These are made for the following groups of people

Walpurgis Night arodjnice in Czech is a holiday celebrated on April 30 or May 1 in Finland Sweden Bohemia Estonia Latvia and Germany

The festival is named after Saint Walburga born in Wessex in 710 a niece of Saint Boniface According to legend she was a daughter to the Saxon prince St Richard Together with her brothers she travelled to Wrttemberg Germany where she became a nun and lived in the convent of Heidenheim which was founded by her brother Wunibald Walburga died on 25 February 779 and that day still carries her name in the Catholic calendar However she was not made a saint until 1 May in the same year and that day carries her name in the Swedish calendar

Historically the Walpurgisnacht is derived from Pagan spring customs where the arrival of spring was celebrated with bonfires at night Viking fertility celebrations took place around April 30 and due to Walburga being declared a saint at that time of year her name became associated with the celebrations Walburga was worshipped in the same way that Vikings had celebrated spring and as they spread throughout Europe the two dates became mixed together and created the Walpurgis Night celebration

In Germany Walpurgisnacht the night from April 30 to May 1 is the night when allegedly the witches hold a large celebration on the Blocksberg and await the arrival of Spring When the travel to that mountain is too far they may also chose another hill in the region they live  Walpurgis Night the night of April 30 when witches meet on the Brocken mountain and hold revels with their Gods 

Brocken the highest of the Harz Mountains of north central Germany It is noted for the phenomenon of the Brocken spectre and for witches revels which reputably took place there on Walpurgis night The Brocken Spectre is a magnified shadow of an observer typically surrounded by rainbow like bands thrown onto a bank of cloud in high mountain areas when the sun is low The phenomenon was first reported on the Brocken 

Taken from Oxford Phrase Fable 

Bird flu is an illness caused by a virus The virus called influenza A or type A usually lives in birds but sometimes infects mammals including humans It is called influenza when it infects humans

There are many types of influenza A which was first found in a bird in Italy in 1878 Most types have weak symptoms such as breathing problems similar to the common cold

But some types kill birds and a few kill humans and other mammals One type of bird flu called Spanish flu killed 50 to 100 million people in 19181919 Another type called Asian Flu killed one million in 1957 and another one called Hong Kong Flu also killed one million people in 1968

A subtype called H5N1 killed six people in Hong Kong in 1997 but did not kill again until 2003 this time in China Until the middle of 2005 it was primarily found in southeast Asia but since then has spread to parts of Africa and Europe It has killed tens of millions of birds and resulted in the slaughter of hundreds of millions of other birds to limit its spread So far it is mostly a bird disease and rarely infects humans The concern about H5N1 is that it is constantly evolving at a very fast rate and could create a human flu pandemic that could kill many millions of people Governments around the world are spending billions of dollars to deal with this problem studying H5N1 creating vaccines conducting pandemic practice exercises stockpiling useful flu medication and many other important activities

The Jyllands Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy is a controversy about a series of cartoons They were first published in a Danish newspaper The publication led to an outcry and sparked violent protests in the islamic world with many people dying 

The crisis began after cartoons depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad were published in the Danish newspaper Jyllands Posten on September 30 2005 Danish Muslim organizations staged protests in response As the controversy has grown some or all of the cartoons have been reprinted in newspapers in more than fifty other countries The protests got worse when fake cartoons were released

One of the cartoons showed Muhammad with a bomb in his turban Some people thought this was saying that all Muslims are terrorists But other cartoons made fun of the Jyllands Posten newspaper One insulted the editors of the newspaper by using the language Farsi 

Critics claims that the cartoons are culturally insulting Islamophobic blasphemous and intended to humiliate a marginalized minority However supporters of the cartoons claim they illustrate an important issue and their publication exercises the right of free speech They have also claimed that similar cartoons are made relative to other religions arguing that Islam and its followers have not been targeted in a discriminatory way 

Blasphemy is a word that means speaking badly about a religion or insulting a god In many countries blasphemy is a crime

Brie is a type of soft cheese with a yellowish interior and a white layer on the outside of the cheese Like other cheeses Brie is a dairy product made from milk In some countries Brie cheese is served with fruit as a dessert at the end of a meal 

Originally Brie was a French cheese but now there are also Brie style cheeses from outside of France The cheese is produced in the region of the same name It is made of the milk of cows 

The milk of soft cheeses is not heated during the production of the cheese Talleyrand said about this kind of cheese that it was the king of cheeses He said that in the 19th century This kind of cheese has been made for at least 1000 years though

In Europe this cheese is usually not treated chemically It might therefore change in consistency or color It will go bad if it is not kept in the refrigerator In most countries Brie style cheeses are made with Pasteurized milk

The following kinds of Brie exist

Other French Bries are

Bries from outside France

Cheeses are made into round loaves of about 36 cm in diameter The cheeses then weight about 25 kilograms It is best tasted from April to October after a ripening period of 8 to 10 weeks About 2 of the production occurs on farms

The Brie de Melun is smaller than the Brie de Meaux but more salt is added to it The ripening period is 10 weeks It is best consumed April to September but it can be found March to November in some locations About 5 of production occurs on farms

When people buy Brie they should make sure that it has the following traits

Charles Maurice de Talleyrand Prigord was a French diplomat He worked successfully from the regime of Louis XVI through the French Revolution and then under Napoleon I Louis XVIII and Louis Philippe Since the turn of the 19th century he was known simply as Talleyrand He is widely seen as one of the most versatile and influential diplomats in European history although he was known to accept bribes from other European powers especially while serving under Napoleon

Pasteurization is a process of making foods stay fresh It is named after Louis Pasteur He was the first person to learn how to do it The first pasteurization was done by Louis Pasteur and Claude Bernard on April 20 1862

People pasteurize food to kill any harmful microbes This makes food safe to eat 

Unlike sterilization pasteurization is not intended to kill all microorganisms in the food as compared to appertization invented by Nicolas Franois Appert Instead pasteurization wants to get a log reduction in the number of viable organisms It wants to bring their number down so they are unlikely to cause disease Commercial scale sterilization of food is not common because it adversely affects the taste and quality of the product

Pasteurization is usually done to milk which was first suggested by Franz von Soxhlet in 1886 There are two popular ways to pasteurize milk First high temperatureshort time and second ultra high temperature HTST is the most common method Milk only labeled pasteurized is usually treated with the HTST method whereas milk labelled ultra pasteurized or UHT must be treated with the UHT method HTST is when the milk is at a temperature of 1615 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 15 seconds UHT is when the milk is at a temperature of 280 F or 138 C for at least two seconds 

Pasteurization rules are usually set by national food safety agencies These agencies say milk has to be HTST pasteurized to have the pasteurized label There are different rules for different dairy products depending on the fat content and what they will be used for For example the pasteurization rules for cream are different than the rules for fluid milk and the standards for pasteurizing cheese are designed to keep the phosphatase enzyme fresh which helps in making the cheese

HTST pasteurized milk normally has a refrigerated shelf life of two or three weeks but ultra pasteurized milk can last much longer when refrigerated sometimes two or three months When UHT pasteurization is mixed with safe handling and container technology it can even be stored unrefrigerated for even longer periods of time

In addition to the standard HTST and UHT pasteurization standards there are other lesser known pasteurization techniques The first technique called batch pasteurization involves heating large batches of milk to a lower temperature typically 155 F The other technique is called higher heatshorter time and it lies somewhere between HTST and UHT in terms of time and temperature Pasteurization causes some irreversible and some temporary denaturization of the proteins in milk

In most legislations double pasteurization is not allowed A heat treatment at a lower temperature or for a shorter time is sometimes performed Possibly such milk could be called raw milk or confusingly unpasteurized milk It cannot be called pasteurized even though a significant number of pathogens are destroyed during the process

In recent years there has been some consumer interest in raw milk products due to perceived health benefits Advocates of raw milk maintain correctly that some components survive in milk that has not been pasteurized Specifically raw milk contains immunoglobulins and the enzymes lipase and phosphatase which are inactivated by heat Raw milk also contains vitamin B6 of which up to 20 may be lost on heat treatment It is also claimed to contain beneficial bacteria which aid digestion and boost immunity 

Commercial distribution of packaged raw milk is not allowed in most US states

Some doctors acknowledge that certain people should not drink raw milk including pregnant or breast feeding mothers those undergoing immunosuppression treatment for cancer organ transplant or autoimmune diseases and those who are immunocompromised due to diseases like AIDS

In fact some doctors suggest that babies and breast feeding mothers avoid all but UHT pasteurized dairy products 

In Africa it is common to boil milk whenever it is harvested This intense heating greatly changes the flavor of milk which the people in Africa are accustomed to

Milk pasteurization standards have been subject to increasing scrutiny in recent years due to the discovery of pathogens that are both widespread and heat resistant Researchers have developed more sensitive diagnostics such as real time PCR and improved culture methods that have enabled them to identify pathogens in pasteurized milk

Note The following paragraphs in this section discuss controversial ongoing research

One bacterium in particular the organism Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis which causes Johnes disease in cattle and is suspected of causing at least some Crohns disease in humans has been found to survive pasteurization in retail milk in the US the UK Greece and the Czech Republic The food safety authorities in the UK have decided to re evaluate pasteurization standards in light of the MAP results and other evidence of harmful pasteurization resistant pathogens

The USDA has not re evaluated their position on pasteurization adequacy They do not dispute the studies which are at this point accepted by the scientific community but maintain that the presence of MAP in retail pasteurized milk must be due to post pasteurization contamination However some researchers within the FDA which is responsible for food safety in the US have begun pushing for a re evaluation of these results There is a small but growing body of criticism directed at these agencies by Crohns disease sufferers scientists and doctors Some have suggested that the US dairy industry has been successful in suppressing the agencies response to a potential health crisis for fear of consumer panic which would lead to a decrease in milk consumption It is worth noting that while MAP has not been definitely proven to be harmful in humans all other mycobacteria are pathogenic and it has been definitively shown to cause disease in cattle and other ruminants

A newer method called flash pasteurization involves shorter exposure to higher temperatures and is claimed to be better for preserving color and taste in some products

The term cold pasteurization is used sometimes for the use of ionizing radiation or other means to kill bacteria in food Food irradiation is also sometimes called electronic pasteurization

Products that can be pasteurized

Soft cheese is cheese that does not get heated during production

A cult is a religious group of people It is often a small newly started religious movement Cults have beliefs or practices that many people think of as being odd or that have practices that most people in the world do not practice 

Whether a religious group is or is not a cult is a difficult problem Personal opinions may change over time What is at one point in time considered a cult may later be accepted as a religion and what at one point of time is considered an accepted religion may later become a cult

In order to determine therefore whether a specific religious group is as a cult an absolute criteria for truth needs to be used to measure the doctrines and beliefs of the group against those of a known standard to eastablish a link for measurement to compare against and juxtapose so as to enable an accurate and fair representation of the current notch at which the complements and differences are held

The Cult is a English rock band They formed in 1982 under the name Death Cult and later renamed to Southern Death Cult in 1983 then was again renamed to their current name The Cult

1028 was a common year when the Julian calendar was used It was the twenty eighth year of the 2nd millennium and the 11th century

James Albert Michener was an American writer He wrote such books as Tales of the South Pacific Hawaii The Drifters Texas and Poland Most of his 40 books are very large sagas They are about the lives of many generations in a particular place His non fiction writings include the 1992 book The World is My Home and Sports in America

Michener wrote that he did not know who his parents were or exactly when and where he was born He was raised by an adoptive mother Mabel Michener in Doylestown Pennsylvania Some have argued that Mabel was his birth mother He graduated from Swarthmore College where he played basketball in 1929 He later studied at the Colorado State Teachers College He taught there for several years He also taught at Harvard University 

His writing career began during World War II He was assigned to the South Pacific Ocean as a naval historian He used his time there as the basis for Tales of the South Pacific his first book This book was the basis for the musical South Pacific

Michener met his wife Mari while in Japan His novel Sayonara is autobiographical

On January 10 1977 he was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Gerald R Ford

In his final years he lived in Austin Texas

The War of 1812 was fought between the British Empire and the United States from 1812 to 1814 on land in North America and at sea More than half of the British forces were made up of Canadian militia because British soldiers had to fight Napoleon in Europe The British defeated the attacking American forces In the beginning the war increased levels of nationalism in both Canada and the United States 

The Americans declared war against Great Britain because the British began taking American ships by force and they were kidnapping American sailors and forcing them to serve in the British navy The fighting began when the United States started to attack the Canadian provinces in 1812 and 1813 but the borders were successfully defended by the British In 1813 British and American ships fought in Lake Erie in a battle known as the Battle of Lake Erie Americans under Oliver Hazard Perry lost 

In 1814 British soldiers landed in the United States They burned Washington DC to the ground and also attacked Baltimore It was during this battle that a poem was written by an American soldier Francis Scott Key The poem was later used to give the words to a new national anthem for the United States The Star Spangled Banner The final battle of the war took place in January of 1815 The British attacked New Orleans and lost against the Americans and General Andrew Jackson The battle took place after the peace treaty had been signed

Chandigarh also called The Beautiful City is a city in India It is a union territory because it is the capital of two states Punjab and Haryana As a territory it does not belong to either state 

Sikh nationalists want the city as a future capital of Khalistan It is well known for its mixed cultural background and its fast development in the field of Information Technology It has outlets of many famous multinational companies established here and is emerging as a hub for business development The territory covers an area of 44 mi or 114 km it is bigger than Montserrat but smaller than Jersey

A convection current is caused by the expansion of a liquid or gas due to its rise in temperature The material becomes less dense and rises As it gets colder it starts to fall or sink This starts the cycle of a convection current This only happens to fluids that are near an energy source that causes it to expand For example the movement of water in a pan is driven by a localized heat source When cool water goes to an edge of a pie pan the water is dense It flows around and back to the center As the water nears the hot metal it warms again and rises as steam to repeat the cycle The hot fluid becomes less dense and rises so molecules are carried to a new location Energy in hot fluid transfers away fluid contracts becoming more dense and the fluid flows downward again Another example are the clouds and the earth The precipitation goes down and the heat source makes it rise into the clouds again which becomes a continuous cycle The mass of fluid flowing in a circle is a convection cell This is known as convection Convection is the movement of water from a heat energy source and density changes because the fluids heat changes from the heat energy causing it to rise and sink Heat from within the earth creates convection currents which cause the plates to move perhaps by a few centimeters a year Plates may either move away from towards or sideways past neighboring plates It is also the transformation of water to vapor due to the Earths crust 

After the liquidgas has expanded it becomes cooler and cooler and it reaches a point where it just turns to water vapour and the particles of the liquid in the fluid becomes a gas Most of the information about heat is usually related to the particle theory so you may keep that in mind

A good example is a central heating system The heat will rise if it is less dense and will fall if it is cold and more dense

A chipmunk is a small squirrel like rodent About twenty three species fall under this title with one species in northeastern Asia one in the eastern portions of Canada and the US and all the rest native to the western part of North America

The name may have originally been spelled chitmunk However the earliest form comes from the Oxford English Dictionary as chipmonk Other early forms include chipmuck and chipminck

Chip n Dale two Disney cartoon characters are famous chipmunks in pop culture Another such trio is Alvin Simon and Theodore

Montevideo is the capital and the largest city in Uruguay it was founded by the Portuguese in 1717 Its best neighbourhood is called Carrasco This neighbourhood is very exclusive due to its architectural styles

Esther is the name of a book in the Tanakh and the Old Testament and also its title heroine It is the basis for the Jewish celebration Purim

Although it is never said who wrote the book of Esther from inside evidence it is possible to make some guesses about the author and when it was written The author was a Jew because he broken wikt linkemphasizeemphasizes where the Jewish festival came from and from the Jewish broken wikt linknationalismnationalism inside the story The author probably lived in a Persian city because he knew Persian customs well and does not say anything about the land of Judah or Jerusalem The earliest date of the book would be a little while after the events were told for instance about 460 BC It is also thought that the festival of Purim had been celebrated some time before this book was written

The authors main purpose was to write about how the yearly festival of Purim started and to make people remember the saving of the Jewish people during King Xerxes reign The book shows both the start of the festival and why it should continue to be celebrated

In the book the author repeatedly talks about the conflict between Israel and the Amalekites a conflict that began during the exodus and continued through Israels history The author of Esther views them as the symbol of all the powers of the world against Gods people Now that Israel has been released from broken wikt linkcaptivitycaptivity Hamans dangerous broken wikt linkedictedict is the final try in the Old Testament time to get rid of them When Haman is defeated Israel enjoys a time of rest

Feasting is another important theme in Esther as seen in the picture on the left Banquets are the setting for important parts of the story There are ten banquets 

Repeating is one of the main features of the style of the book of Esther The three groups of banquets come in pairs there are two lists of the kings servants two reports that Esther hid who she was two gatherings of women two houses for the women two fasts two talks of Haman with his wife and friends two sudden visits to the king by Esther two coverings of Hamans face two royal commands two cooling of the kings anger two days for the Jews to protect themselves and take broken wikt linkvengeancevengeance and two letters about how Purim started

Another important feature of this book that has been often wondered at is that it never directly talks about God worship prayer or sacrifice This has made some people think the book is not as religious as other books However it is possible that the author purposefully did not say anything about God or anything religious to show more clearly that it is God who controls all the unimportant broken wikt linkcoincidencecoincidences that are in the story and end in saving the Jews

The Book of Esther is about a Jewish girl adopted by her uncle Mordecai after her parents had died Xerxes the Persian king who rejected his other wife fell in love with Esther in the beauty contest He took in Esther as the new Persian Queen not knowing she was an Israelite

Meanwhile Haman the kings prime minister creates a grudge against Esthers uncle Mordecai because he does not bow down to him and only to the God of Israel He despises Mordecai because he is a Jew and tries to trick the king into making a law to kill all of the Jews He too does not know that the Queen is a Jew herself

Later Queen Esther finds out the plot by Mordecai and tries to stop it She goes to the king and invites him to dine with her and with Haman so that she may tell him But when he comesshe loses bravery and does not tell him Later she invites him and Haman again and this time she tells him The king furious storms out and Haman asks Esther for mercy When the king comes back in he mistakes Haman for molesting his Queen and hangs him on the gallows that Haman had prepared for Mordecai 

Then Mordecai comes into the presence of the king and receives the signet ring of the king The King then changes the law and saves the Jews because of Esthers pleas

Clay is a fine grained mineral made of aluminium silicate When wet clay has a plastic quality and can be used to made pottery

Clay often contains some water because the water molecules stick to the tiny grains There may also be some organic materials in the clay

The rifle is a gun with a stock to brace against the shoulder and a barrel with twisting grooves The grooves are called rifling and make bullets spin as they fly through the air

Rifles are made to shoot many different sizes of bullets and different amounts of gun powder Rifles are usually made to be able to hit targets far away from the shooter

Modern rifles are made for many different purposes Some are made for hunting animals Some are made for soldiers to use in war Some are made for police to have in case they need them Some are made for target shooting 

Rifles can work in different ways Some rifles have what is called a bolt action where a small handle is used to move a part of the rifle letting the shooter put a bullet in ready for firing and taking that bullet to the right place in the rifle The rifle in the picture above is a bolt action Some are semi automatics where several bullets are put in at once When the trigger is pulled the bullet is fired and the next one is brought into place Some are fully automatic which work like semi automatics but allow the shooter to fire more than one bullet at a time by holding down the trigger

Deuterocanonical books means second canon in Greek It usually means the parts of the Bible that are only used by some Christian churches The books have originally been written in Greek language and they date to era of some 250 150 years before Christ

The books are not part of the Jewish Tanakh since their original language is Greek and not Hebrew Some books considered deuterocanonical by Catholics are

The Book of Daniel and the Book of Esther are longer in Catholic Bibles than in Protestant Bibles because they have more stories

Most Protestant Christian churches do not think that the deuterocanonical books were inspired by God They call these books Apocrypha Martin Luther considered these book very good and useful reading John Calvin considered them as work of Satan

A sidekick is someone who regularly travels with and helps another person In fiction the other person is often a crimefighter or superhero such as Batman and his sidekick Robin Some people consider Sancho Panza Don Quixotes ever faithful companion to be a type of sidekick even though the book was written long before the word sidekick was invented

The Nicobar Islands are an island chain in the eastern Indian Ocean They are part of India

The Nicobar islands include 22 islands of different sizes The largest one is Great Nicobar The total land area of the chain is 1841 km The highest point on the Nicobars is Mount Thullier at 642 m The population of the islands was 42026 in 2001 roughly 65 of whom are indigenous peoples and 35 migrants from India and Sri Lanka

The Nicobars are located southeast of the Indian subcontinentThey are separated form the subcontinent by the Bay of Bengal by about 1300 km and are separated from the Andaman Islands to the north by the 150 km wide Ten Degree Channel and are 189 km from the Indonesian island of Sumatra to the southeast The Andaman and Nicobar islands separate the Bay of Bengal from the Andaman Sea Until the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Indira Point south of Great Nicobar was the southernmost point in India

The islands cluster into three groups The northern group includes Car Nicobar and uninhabited Batti Malv The central group includes Chowra Teressa Poahat Katchal Camorta Nancowry and Trinket the Isle of Man and Tillangchong are uninhabited Tillangchong is a wildlife sanctuary The southern group includes Great Nicobar Little Nicobar Kondul and Pulomilo the islets of Meroe Trak Treis Menchal Cubra Pigeon and Megapod are uninhabited Megapod is a wildlife sanctuary

Administratively the Islands are part of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands a Union territory of India The capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands territory is Port Blair on South Andaman The Union Territory is divided into two districts Andaman district and Nicobar district The Indian Government presently restricts access to the Nicobars by special permit and in general non Indian citizens are forbidden from visiting the Nicobar Islands

The Andaman and Nicobar Islands is a union territory of India The name is often shortened to A N Islands or ANI It is in the Indian Ocean in the southern part of the Bay of Bengal It is made of two island groups  the Andaman Islands and the Nicobar Islands  separating the Andaman Sea to the east from the Indian Ocean These two groups are separated by the 10 N parallel the Andamans lying to the north of this latitude and the Nicobars to the south The capital of this territory is the Andamanese town of Port Blair

The territorys population in the last Census of India was 356152 Added together the total land area of the territory is around 6496 km or 2508 mi it is larger than the Palestinian territories but smaller than Georgia territory of Abkhazia

Kazan is the capital city of Tatarstan and one of Russias largest cities It is a major industrial commercial and cultural center and remains the most important center of Tatar culture Kazan lies at the confluence of the Volga and Kazanka rivers in central European Russia 

The origin of the name is unclear The literal translation of Tatar qazan is a boiler or cauldron Alternately it may have been derived from qazan Tatar for dug ditch

Qazan is originally a name for a special cooking pan a variant of a wok but more solid and heavier It was believed that the city of Kazan is named after this object because of its geographical similarity with a qazan pan namely the city is situated in a U  shape lowland 

Another a more romantic legend tells a story of a Tatar princess Syembik who dropped a golden dish in to the river on which the city is located while washing it

Nevertheless Chuvash legends refer to Bulgarian prince Khusan and Chuvashes call this city after the name of this prince

A tornado is a tube of violently spinning air that touches the ground Wind inside the tornado spins fast but the actual circle of wind around them is massive This makes tornadoes very dangerous Tornadoes are especially dangerous to people in cars or mobile homes

Tornadoes mostly happen during strong thunderstorms called supercell storms They cause a lot of damage to anything in the path Tornadoes are ranked on the Fujita scale from F0 to F5 The F0 has the lowest wind speed and the F5 has the highest one

Tornadoes can happen in nearly any part of the world In the United States a tornado has been created in all states The middle part of the United States is nicknamed Tornado Alley for the large amount of tornadoes created there

A tornado does not necessarily need to be visible however the extremely low pressure caused by the high wind speeds and rapid rotation usually causes water vapor in the air to condense into a visible condensation funnel The tornado is the vortex of wind not the condensation cloud

A single storm may produce multiple tornadoes and mesocyclones Tornadoes produced from the same storm are referred to as a tornado family Sometimes multiple tornadoes from distinct mesocyclones occur at the same time

Occasionally several tornadoes are spawned from the same very large storm If there is no break in their activity this is considered a tornado outbreak although there are various definitions A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area is a tornado outbreak sequence occasionally called an extended tornado outbreak

Sometimes tornadoes happen in groups 148 tornadoes struck on the same day in April 1974 Many towns in midwestern America and Canada were destroyed More than 300 people died They were hit by flying wrecks buried under houses and thrown by powerful winds That day students in Xenia Ohio were practicing for a play in the auditorium stage One girl looked out the window and saw the tornado The students ran into the hall covering their heads A few seconds later all the school buses flew right onto the stage

A man in another town hid under the couch in his living room He held onto one couch leg The tornado struck his house and winds blew around him When the tornado left he was outside There was no house The couch had disappeared and he was only holding onto one couch leg

A tornado watch is given when the weather conditions look like a tornado could form A PDS watch is given when a likely tornado outbreak is to start many strong tornadoes will form in the area or an ongoing tornado outbreak is in the works in the area A tornado warning is given if someobdy has actually seen a tornado or if a tornado signiture has shown up on radar Tornado Emergencies are a special weather statement saying that a powerful tornado is about to hit an area with a lot of people in it a tornado has been spotted and the tornado is expected to cause deaths

To keep safe in a tornado here are some tips you can follow

A hard disk drive hard disk or hard drive is something used by computers to store information Hard disks use magnetic recording to store information on rotating circular platters The capacity of a hard drive is usually measured in gigabytes A gigabyte is one thousand megabytes and a megabyte is one million bytes which means that a gigabyte is one billion bytes Some hard drives are so large that their capacity is measured in terabytes where one terabyte is a thousand gigabytes Very early Consumer Grade hard drives were measured in Megabytes

Over the years there have been many disk interface types though all used the same rotating platter recording technology Differences were in how the data was encoded to binary data integrity data transfer speeds cabling requirements and of course costs Some once common but now virtually obsolete types of hard drive interfaces are

Hard disks use different interfaces and ports An interface usually has two parts First there is the specification of how the signals are transmitted This includes what cables to use what length the cables can be and so on The second part of the interface definition is the language to use This speaks about what the signals mean

As there are different kinds of hard disks there are also different kinds of interfaces In 2009 it was common to attach a hard disk using a Serial ATA connection The connection that came before that was called IDE and is called Parallel ATA today In large data centers Fibre Channel is often used

For servers the SCSI interface is very popular There are several types and versions of SCSI interface like parallel and Serial Attached SCSI each stepping up in terms of speed and price Within servers several SCSI drives are often used in conjunction with each other in order to safeguard against data loss or corruption

A magnet is a very special metal When a magnet goes near a special kind of metal or other magnets and the poles touching are opposite it will pull or attract the other metal or magnet closer Also if the two poles are the same the two magnets will push away or repel from each other This is called magnetism Magnets can make some other metals into magnets when they are rubbed together A soft or impermanent magnet is one which loses its memory of previous magnetizations Soft magnetic materials are often used in electromagnets to enhance the magnetic field of a wire that carries an electrical current and is wrapped around the magnet the field of the soft magnet increases with the current Permanent magnets occur naturally in some rocks particularly lodestone but are now more commonly manufactured A magnets magnetism decreases when it is heated and increases when it is cooled It has to be heated at around 1000 degrees Celsius Naturalpermanent magnets are not artificial and is made from a kind of rock called lodestone or magnetite Like poles will repel each other while unlike poles will attract each other

Magnets are only attracted to special metals Metals that have iron and steel attract magnets well Metals like brass copper zinc and aluminum are not attracted to magnets Also non magnetic materials such as wood and glass are not attracted to magnets as they do not have the right particles inside them like magnetic materials do

A compass uses the Earths magnetic field and will always point to the North Pole A north side of the magnet is attracted to the south side of another magnet However the north side of the compass points to the north pole this can only mean that the north pole is really the magnetic south and the south pole is really the magnetic north

The first people to discover magnetic rocks were the Chinese They called it the loving stone because the stones love metal the way parents love children At first the Chinese used the stones to preform fortune telling and magic tricks Later on they used the loving stones to invent the compass

A mebibyte is a unit of measure It represents 1024 1024 bytes 

A mebibyte is a unit of information or computer storage abbreviated MiB

The mebibyte is closely related to the megabyte This can either be a synonym for mebibyte or refer to 106 bytes 1000000 bytes depending on context The two numbers are relatively close together but mistaking the two has nevertheless occasionally led to problems 

The unit was defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission in December 1998 Use of mebibyte and related units is strongly endorsed by IEEE and CIPM and is slowly becoming more common

One mebibyte equals 1024 kibibytes and 1024 mebibytes equal one gibibyte

Mibibyte is a common misspelling presumably from the i in the abbreviation or confusion about how the surrounding prefixes were actually formed The i is actually from the end of the prefix Tebi and pebi are similarly abbreviated Ti and Pi but they are not usually misspelled as storage sizes currently are only this large in specialized situations

The roller coaster is a kind of amusement ride A roller coaster is like a train It has a number of carriages that travel on a set of tracks This track has hills and valleys and sometimes has other features that will turn the train upside down The track can be made from wood or steel Some roller coasters are made for children so they do not travel very fast Other roller coasters are made very tall and they travel very fast Riders are generally restrained in place with a bar a belt or something similar

A roller coaster works because of gravity a force that pulls things down to the ground Most roller coaster trains are pulled to the top of a hill with a machine The train will slide down the track which has a number of hills and valleys As it slides down a hill it will travel faster

In the United States LaMarcus Adna Thompson patented the first roller coaster on January 20 1865 He named his ride the Switchback Railway and workers pulled the carriage to the top of the track The first modern steel roller coaster was the Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland It opened in 1959

The Zimbabwe dollar was a currency for Zimbabwe from 1980 to 2009 Zimbabwe had the highest rate of inflation in the world The rate of inflation grew to 23115088887 in July 2008

Because of hyperinflation or inflation that is out of control the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe had to print banknotes with higher values to cope with the rising cost of living In January 2009 Zimbabwe released a banknote for one hundred trillion dollars or 100000000000000

The Zimbabwe dollar had to be revalued three times due to the rising cost of living in August 2006 August 2008 and February 2009 In August 2006 the first revaluation dollar was violent and too quick meaning that many people lost their savings because they were unable to convert it into the new currency without fear of violence and corruption

Since 12 April 2009 Zimbabwe stopped using the Zimbabwean dollar and adopted currencies from other countries such as the United States Dollar

Bahia is a state in the northeast area of Brazil on the Atlantic Ocean coast

The capital city of Bahia is Salvador Other cities where many people live are Feira de Santana Vitria da Conquista Itabuna Ilhus and Juazeiro Almost all of Bahia is 200 m above the sea level The So Francisco River is the longest river in Bahia Salvador was the capital of Brazil from 1549 until 1763

Bahia is the sixth richest Brazilian state The economy of Bahia is based on industry agriculture animal husbandry tourism mining and services

Body modification is when a person changes their body in a way that lasts forever or for a long time There are many different kinds of body modification like piercing circumcision or tattoos Almost all cultures do some kind of body modification

People who do not like body modification sometimes call it disfigurement or mutilation They believe that if someone changes their body it is wrong and they are doing something dangerous or unethical

Body modification is done for different reasons Religions might tell people that they should change their bodies to look a certain way Other people with body modifications might just like the way the body modifications look or how they feel good during sex

A serial killer is someone who murders several people at different times The victims are usually people the serial killer does not know and the killer commits his crimes to get a certain kind of excitement or other feeling He usually has no practical motive such as robbery or revenge

Serial killer first became a commonly used phrase for this kind of killers in the 1970s This was the result of the crimes of people like Ted Bundy and David Berkowitz Jack the Ripper is thought by many to be one of the first serial killers that many people knew about even though his victims were killed long before the phrase was invented

A serial killers crimes are nearly always alike in some ways The killer may only attack a certain type of person for instance women of a certain age or appearance He may always use the same kind of weapon to kill his victims or may treat them in a certain manner such as tying them up with the same kind of rope or adhesive tape Some serial killers have had very strange habits which leave evidence of their work at each crime for instance Albert de Salvo the Boston Strangler would tie the cord with which he had strangled a woman around her neck in a special bow To law enforcement officers a serial killers habits are known as his signature and they are always valuable leads in detecting who he is and capturing him

Some of the worst serial killers have been doctors Harold Shipman a British general practitioner is thought to have killed up to 250 of his patients John Bodkin Adams also British is thought to have killed 163 patients

The World Wide Fund for Nature is an international environmental organization based in Switzerland Their mascot is the Giant Panda It is the worlds largest independent conservation organization with over 5 million supporters worldwide working in more than 90 countries supporting 15000 conservation and environmental projects around the world It is a charity with approximately 90 of its funding coming from voluntary donations by private individuals and businesses

Deforestation is when forests are lost because people want to make farms ranches and cities Without the forest the habitats of the animals are lost and many animals die It is also a result of global warming

Deforestation is the removal of trees for requirements of growing population They remove the trees and use the land to make farms They also use the wood from the trees to make buildings or to burn the trees for heat Sometimes forests are lost because people want to make cities bigger this means building roads and buildings on the land where the forests are 

Forests have the following functions

Forests are often planted to protect against natural disasters When forests are lost very often the soil they protected is also lost This loss of soil is often called erosion We give out carbon dioxide when we breathe and plants and trees take it in by photosynthesis 

Trees are also important for storing carbon Deforestation causes the carbon in the trees to go into the air again and this causes more carbon dioxide in our atmosphere Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas deforestation causes global warming In fact 20 of global warming is caused by deforestationcn

Scuba Diving is a recreational activity where people can swim underwater for a long time using a tank filled with compressed air The tank is a large metal cylinder made of steel or aluminum  The divers have special equipment called BCDs to control whether they float or sink they can add air or remove air by using dump valves or an inflator on their secondary regulator They also use a Regulator A regulator is a piece of equipment which connects to the tank and controls how much air is sent from the tank to the diver it helps adjust the air to the pressure that the diver is at so they can breathe properly at any depth It helps the diver to breathe in from the tank and out to the water

Divers also use other equipment They wear a mask to see through fins on their feet to swim better and a wetsuit to keep them warm under water because water makes you cold four times as fast as air

The word Scuba is an acronym from broken wikt linkself containedSelf Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus

A capillary is a single celled blood vessel It does not have the muscularelastic tissue of other blood vessels It has a single celled wall to help substances be transported through organisms Capillaries are small and smaller than any other blood vessels They are about 5 10 ms big which connect arterioles and venules and enable the moving of water oxygen carbon dioxide and many other nutrient and waste chemical between blood and surrounding tissues

Blood moves from the heart to arteries which branch and narrow into smaller arteries and then branch more into capillaries After oxygen has been moved to the tissue capillaries join and widen to become small veins and then widen more to become veins which return blood to the heart

The capillary bed is the network of capillaries supplying an organ The more metabolically active the cells the more capillaries it will require to supply nutrients and carry away waste products 

Special arteries connect between arterioles and venules and are important in bypassing the flow of blood through the capillaries True capillaries come from mainly from metarterioles and provide movement between cells and the circulation The width of 8 m forces the red blood cells to partly fold into bullet like shapes in order to bypass them in single file

Precapillary muscles are rings of smooth muscles at the start of true capillaries that handle blood flow into true capillaries and control blood flow through a body part or area

The capillary wall is a one layer tissue so thin that gas and other items such as oxygen water proteins and fats can pass through them driven by pressure differences Waste items such as carbon dioxide and urea can move back into the blood to be carried away for removal from the body 

The capillary bed usually moves no more than 25 of the amount of blood it could contain although this amount can be increased through auto regulation by making the smooth muscle relax in the arterioles that lead to the capillary bed as well as metarterioles making themselves smaller

The capillaries do not have this smooth muscle in their own wall and so any change in their width is passive Any signaling molecules they release act on the smooth muscle cells in the walls of nearby larger vessels eg arterioles

Capillarys ability to move items can be increased by the release of certain cytokines such as in an the body defending itself form germs

Viriato Clemente da Cruz an Angolan poet and politician was born in 1928 in Kikuvo Angola and died in Beijing China on 13 June 1973 

He is considered one of the most important Angolan poets of his time He wrote poems in Portugese and Angolan languages He took part in the fight to free Angola from Portuguese rulers

He was educated in Luanda the capital of Angola which was then ruled by Portugal As a young man in 1957 he went to Paris where he met Mario Pinto de Andrade another Angolan poet and politician who helped with his political ideas In the 1960s they helped create the group called the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola 

The MPLA was in not in Angola at this time but was first in Conackry and then later in Leopoldville Congo Viriato da Cruz became secretary general of the MPLA After some time he and others did not agree with some people in the group and this led to fighting in the streets of Leopoldville

Viriato da Cruz went to Beijing China in the 1960s because of the fighting in the MPLA At first the Chinese government welcomed him He was well known because he had helped create the MPLA The Chinese wanted Viriato da Cruz to help them bring Maoist socialism to Africa 

This was a big problem for Viriato and his family His ideas were not the same as the Maoists He thought that stronger countries can not bring a socialist revolution to other places He was very brave and did not change his ideas This was against the Chinese Maoist idea of world revolution

Viriato da Cruz wanted to leave China and return to Africa but the Chinese government would not let him go and they were not good to him This may be because he could have made trouble for their work in Africa 

The last years of the life of Viriato da Cruz were unhappy and difficult He was weak without much food and he died on 13 Jun 1973 His dead body was taken away in a military vehicle and his burial was without any ceremony 

Some Angolan people think that this was shocking because Viriato da Cruz worked hard for Angola and was one of the leaders of the liberation from Portugal         

Poems Among these poems Namoro S Santo and Makzu are well known

Molluscs or mollusks are an important phylum of invertebrate animals Most of them are marine They have huge numbers in shore that is in shallow waters near the shore They are probably the largest marine phylum with about 93000 recognised species 23 of all named marine organisms They also occur in freshwater and on land Most molluscs have shells but some groups do not octopods slugs and the gastropods known as sea slugs There is great variety in the phylum much more so than their ancient rivals the brachiopods

Classes of molluscs

A sponge is a member of the phylum Porifera It is a simple animal with no mouth no muscles no heart and no brain It is sessile it cannot move from place to place the way most other animals can A sponge is an animal that grows in one spot like most plants do Nevertheless the phylum is quite successful

There are more than 10000 different species of sponge Most sponges live in the ocean Some live near the edge of the sea Others live in deep water A few sponges live in fresh water All sponges take in water through pores in their bodies The water goes out through a big tube in the center Most Sponges filter little bits of food from the water going through their bodies Animals that get food this way are called filter feeders

Sponges are simple animals but they do have a few things that make them different from other animals 

There are 3 different kinds of sponges The difference between these kinds is in how their skeleton is made 

Sponges are sessile they live in one place where they are fixed to the ground A few sponges are capable of changing their position they can move at speeds of between 1 mm and 4 mm a day They do this like amoebae A few species can contract their whole bodies and many can close their openingsholes

A few species live in waters where there is very little food available They have therefore changed and became predators They prey on small crustaceans and other small animals Most of these sponges belong to the family Cladorhizidae but a few members of the Guitarridae and Esperiopsidae are also carnivores In most cases little is known about how they actually capture prey Some species are thought to use either sticky threads or hooked spicules Most carnivorous sponges live in deep waters up to convert8840mmi and the development of deep ocean exploration techniques is expected to lead to the discovery of several more However one species has been found in Mediterranean caves at depths of 17 23m alongside the more usual filter feeding sponges The cave dwelling predators capture crustaceans under convert1mmin long by entangling them with fine threads digest them by enveloping them with further threads over the course of a few days and then return to their normal shape there is no evidence that they use venom

Most known carnivorous sponges have completely lost the water flow system and choanocytes However the genus Chondrocladia uses a highly modified water flow system to inflate balloon like structures that are used for capturing prey

Sponges usually reproduce when little pieces break off If such a piece has the right types of cells it can grow to become a new sponge A few sponges can also use budding With budding a small sponge grows on the parent when it is done growing it simply falls off When the conditions are bad some sponges can also grow lumps of unspecialised cells These will not develop until the conditions improve again They can then either make a new sponge or they can use the skeleton of the parent sponge

Most sponges reproduce sexually They can make sperm cells that are released into the water These are either captured by another sponge and are then transported to the egg cells of the parent This is known as viviparous Both cells are joined to form larvae which can swim off to find a good place to settle

The other option known as oviparous is that both sperm cells and egg cells are released into the water These then combine outside the sponges

A report in 1997 described how bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay used sponges as tools A dolphin will attach a marine sponge to its rostrum It is thought the sponge is used to protect the rostrum when the dolphin is looking for food in the sandy sea bottom but scientists have not confirmed this The behaviour known as sponging has only been observed in this bay and is almost exclusively shown by females A study in 2005 concluded that mothers teach the behaviour to their daughters and that all the sponge users are closely related This suggests that it is a fairly recent innovation

The calcium carbonate or silica spicules of most sponges make them too rough for most uses but two genera Hippospongia and Spongia have soft entirely fibrous skeletons Early Europeans used soft sponges for many purposes including padding for helmets portable drinking utensils and municipal water filters Until synthetic sponges were invented they were also used as cleaning tools for painting and as contraceptives In the 20th century overfishing is a problem this has caused the animals as well as the industry behind it to be close to extinction

Many objects with sponge like textures are now made of substances that do not come from poriferans Synthetic sponges include personal and household cleaning tools breast implants contraceptive sponges

The luffa sponge also spelled loofah which is commonly sold for use in the kitchen or the shower is not derived from an animal but from the fibrous skeleton of a gourd

The amplitude or peak amplitude of a wave is a measure of how big its oscillation is Amplitudes are always positive numbers and are never negative Amplitudes are positive because distance can only be greater than zero or equal to zero negative distance does not exist

The distance from the top of one peak to the bottom of another is called peak to peak amplitude Another way to describe peak to peak amplitude is to say that it is the distance between the maximum positive value and the maximum negative value of a wave

Ska is a kind of popular music from Jamaica that was developed in the 1950s Ska music played at a slower tempo turned into reggae in the late 1960s

Ska music bands include singers electric guitars electric bass guitar piano organ saxophone trumpet and trombone

In ska the electric guitar and piano normally play short chords on the off beat If you go one and two and three and four the off beat is the And 

In ska the singer does a style of Jamaican singing called toasting When a singer is toasting they make sounds repeat words invent rhymes and shout into the microphone The Jamaican toasting style of singing and talking turned into rap music in the 1980s

Musicians who play ska dress in hats and suits Many ska bands wear clothes with a chessboard pattern of black and white squares This pattern symbolizes the way that ska music mixes of Black and White musicans and styles of music 

Even though ska was developed in the 1950s it became popular again in the 1980s in Britain In the 1980s ska bands such as The Specials The Selecter The English Beat and Madness played ska music

In the 1990s some bands mixed ska music with Punk rock to make ska punk This kind of ska music is from England and the United States Some pop punk bands from the 1990s mixed pop punk with ska punk

The Braille system is a way of writing things It is named after Louis Braille the French man who invented it Today the system is used by blind people to read and write The Braille system uses an alphabet of letters or characters Each character is made of a series of dots that rise out of the paper in a special pattern Blind people read braille by using their fingers to feel the characters 

Louis Braille was not the first to think about a writing system for the blind In the 17th century the Italian Jesuit Francesco Lana thought about different systems of coded writing for the blind He invented a system which relies on relief printing on thick paper Another writing system he invented let blind people write by making lines and dots 

Valentin Hay was one of the first French who took interest in the problems the blind had when they wanted to communicate Hay was born in Picardie in 1745 and studied languages at the university in Paris First he took interest in the deaf people who could not speak later in the blind people In his opinion their biggest problem was that they could not read He then invented a system which allowed them to read and write sentences and mathematical expressions Later he started a school for blind children His writing system used two columns which had between one and six positions each Vowels had a dot in the left column for example 

The Braille system was based on a method of communication originally developed by Charles Barbier Barbier made it because Napoleon wanted a code that soldiers could use to exchange messages silently and without light at night Barbier called it night writing Night writing uses two columns of six dots It uses phonemes not letters Barbiers system was too complex for soldiers to learn the military rejected it From the year 1821 he started to test his system in the school Hay had founded There it became very successful Even though the system was difficult to learn it greatly improved on reading Barbier had understood that it was better to use a system that used dots over one that used lines

When Barbier met Braille when he visited the National Institute of the Blind Braille saw the biggest problem of the code The human finger cannot feel the whole symbol without moving This makes it impossible to move rapidly from one symbol to the next Brailles change was to use a 6 dot cell the braille system which revolutionized written communication for the blind

Braille can be seen as the worlds first binary character encoding The system as originally invented by Braille has two parts

Braille is used with different languages today In each language the letters are encoded differently the same letter is at a different position in the alphabet This is known as braille code or code page There are also different braille codes in use for special purposes like writing shorthand mathematics or music 

To make it possible to read faster certain transcriptions of Braille use contractions This is known as Grade 2 Braille

Braille uses cells of six raised dots in two columns of three dots The dot positions on the left are numbered one to three the ones on the right four to six as shown in the picture

Each symbol is coded with certain dots present and others absent The dots are approximately 002 inches high inside the cell the dots are about 01 inches apart The space between the dots of two cells is about 015 inches horizontally and 02 inches vertically A standard braille page is 11 inches by 11 inches and typically has between forty and forty two braille cells per line and twenty five lines

As originally conceived by Louis Braille a sequence of characters using the top 4 dots of the braille cell represents letters a through j Dot 3 is added to each of the a through j symbols to give letters k through t Both of the bottom dots are added to the symbols for a through e to give letters u v x y and z The letter w is an exception to the pattern because French did not make use of the letter w at the time Louis Braille devised his alphabet and thus he had no need to encode the letter w

English braille codes the letters and punctuation and some double letter signs and word signs directly but capitalization and numbers are dealt with by using a prefix symbol In practice braille produced in the United Kingdom does not have capital letters 

There are braille codes for representing shorthand and for representing mathematics and musical notation

Braille can be made using a slate and a stylus in which each dot is created from the back of the page writing in mirror image by hand or it may be produced on a braille typewriter or Perkins Brailler or produced by a braille embosser attached to a computer It may also be rendered using a refreshable braille display

The six code braille is very limited it only allows 64 different combinations Keeping to the 6 bit code means that many things need more than one braille character to be coded A good example for this is how numbers are coded First there is a symbol that says the next symbol is a number and then there is the symbol for the number Louis Braille coded the number 1 the same way as a 2 the same as b and so on The letter i can also mean 9 and j stands for the zero There is another system for coding numbers called Antoine This comes from mathematics It uses one character to say there is a number and then there are 10 different symbols for the 10 digits The symbol for number is usually given only once every symbol that follows is treated as a number until there is a space 

Braille has been extended to an 8 dot code particularly for use with braille embossers and refreshable braille displays In 8 dot braille the additional dots are added at the bottom of the cell giving a matrix 4 dots high by 2 dots wide The additional dots are given the numbers 7 and 8 8 dot braille has the advantages that the case of an individual letter is directly coded in the cell containing the letter and that all the printable ASCII characters can be represented in a single cell All 256 possible combinations of 8 dots are encoded by the Unicode standard Braille with six dots is frequently stored as braille ASCII

It is possible to transcribe braille by replacing each letter with its braille counterpart This is usually known as Grade 1 Braille Grade 1 braille is mostly used by beginners 

The basic problem of Grade 1 braille is that braille letters are much larger than printed ones The standard page is 11x11 in size and only has room for twenty five lines of forty characters

For this reason almost all braille books use a transcription known as Grade 2 braille Grade 2 braille uses contractions which allows to save space and increase reading speed Grade 2 braille was developed by linguists who also looked at customs styles and practices Transcribing a text into Grade 2 braille is difficult and the people doing the transcription need to have a special education There is a book on how to transcribe to braille in the Library of Congress This book has almost 200 pages 

In English there are 23 words which are replaced with a single letter That way the word but is contracted to the single letter b can to c do to d and so on Even this simple rule has exceptions and special cases which must be thought of As an example only the verb to do is replaced by d the noun do is a different word and is written in full 

Sometimes portions of words are contracted There are many rules for this process For example the character with dots 2 3 5 stands for ff when used in the middle of a word At the beginning of a word this same character stands for the word to although the character is written in braille with no space following it At the end of a word the same character represents an exclamation point

The contraction rules take into account the linguistic structure of the word thus contractions are not to be used when their use would alter the usual braille form of a base word to which a prefix or suffix has been added In addition some portions of the transcription rules are not fully codified and rely on the judgment of the transcriber Thus when the contraction rules permit the same word in more than one way preference is given to the contraction that more nearly approximates correct pronunciation

Grade 3 Braille is a system that includes many additional contractions It is almost like a shorthand It is rarely used for publications rather people use it to be able to write and read fast for themselves

Only very few people can use grade 4 braille It uses many rules to shorten grade 3 even further It allows a blind person to use shorthand to follow spoken conversation Very often systems of seven or eight dots are used

The current series of Canadian banknotes have raised dots on the banknotes that indicate their value They can be easily identified by visually impaired people this tactile feature does not use standard braille but instead a system developed in consultation with blind and visually impaired Canadians after research indicated that not all potential users read braille

Though braille is thought to be the main way blind people read and write in Britain out of the reported 2 million visually impaired population it is estimated that only around 15 20 thousand people use Braille Younger people are turning to electronic text on computers instead a more portable communication method that they can also use with their friends A debate has started on how to make braille more attractive and for more teachers to be available to teach it

There are many extensions of Braille for additional letters with diacritics such as  

When braille is adapted to languages which do not use the Latin alphabet the blocks are generally assigned to the new alphabet according to how it is transliterated into the Latin alphabet and the alphabetic order of the national script is disregarded Such is the case with Russian Greek Hebrew Arabic and Chinese In Greek for example gamma is written as Latin g despite the fact that it has the alphabetic position of c Hebrew beth the second letter of the alphabet and cognate with the Latin letter b is instead written v as it is commonly pronounced Russian ts is written as c which is the usual letter for ts in those Slavic languages that use the Latin alphabet and Arabic f is written as f despite being historically p and occurring in that part of the Arabic alphabet Esperanto letters with circumflexes   and are written as those letters without circumflexes with a filled sixth dot The used in Esperanto too is as the u but the first dot is moved to the second place

Greater differences occur in Chinese braille In the case of Mandarin Braille which is based on Zhuyin rather than the Latin Pinyin alphabet the traditional Latin braille values are used for initial consonants and the simple vowels However there are additional blocks for the tones diphthongs and vowel consonant combinations Cantonese Braille is also based on Latin braille for many of the initial consonants and simple vowels but the blocks pull double duty with different values depending on whether they are placed in syllable initial or syllable final position For instance the block for Latin k represents old style Cantonese k when initial but aak when final while Latin j represents Cantonese initial j but final oei 

However at least two adaptations of Braille have completely reassigned the Latin sound values of the blocks These are

In Japanese Braille alphabetic signs for a consonant and vowel are combined into a single syllabic block in Korean Braille the consonants have different syllable initial and syllable final forms These modifications made Braille much more compatible with Japanese kana and Korean hangul but meant that the Latin sound values could not be maintained

Trained readers of Braille can read about 100 words per minute trained readers who do not have sight problems can get to around 250 to 300 words per minute

A switch is something that changes the flow of an electrical circuit The most common kind of switch is something which can be taken off of one course and put onto another The term switch usually means electrical power In applications where more than one switch is needed mechanical switches have been replaced by electronic switches which can be controlled automatically

The switch is called a gate when used in a mathematical form In logic arguments are represented as logic gates The use of electronic gates to work as a system of logical gates is the basic idea behind the computer ie a computer is a lot of electronic switches that work as logic gates

There are many types of switches Some of these are 

The word switch can also mean to change between two things For example on a railway line sometimes the track can split into two different tracks If the train is travelling on one line and changes over to the other it has just done a switch

Sir Francis Bacon KC was an English philosopher statesman and author He has been described as one of the greatest thinkers ever whose ideas have changed the way people think 

He was born in London the son of Sir Nicholas Bacon and the nephew of Queen Elizabeths advisor William Cecil He was educated at Trinity College Cambridge His first job was a lawyer He later became a Member of Parliament and in 1586 he took a leading part in having Mary Queen of Scots executed He became a friend of Robert Deveraux the Earl of Essex in 1591 and received many valuable gifts from him After Essex led a rebellion against the Queen Bacon was one of the people who led the investigation which led to Essexs execution in 1601 

Bacon was often in trouble for spending too much and in 1601 he was arrested for debt When King James became king in 1603 Bacons position improved He was knighted in 1603 He was one of the people appointed to plan the joining of England and Scotland together as one country He married Alice Barnham in 1606 and the next year he was made the Solicitor General He continued to be given better paying positions including Attorney General Lord Keeper and Lord Chancellor 

He was made Baron Verulam in 1618 and Viscount St Albans in 1621 Because he did not have children both titles ended when he died

He used his positions to make more money for himself and in 1621 the Parliament found that he was corrupt He was fined 40000 and removed from all his jobs King James overturned the fine but he was kept as a prisoner in the Tower of London for a while

He became best known as a leading thinker in new ways of looking at the world His writings started and made famous a way of thinking about science This way of thinking is now called the Baconian method It is based on looking at the world by making experiments After watching the results the scientist comes up with an idea to explain what has happened This idea or hypothesis is then further tested by more experiments This way of thinking about science is called inductive methodology In Bacons time these methods were linked with magic including hermeticism and alchemy Alchemy was the study of fire earth water and air Alchemists tried to make gold from lead

Sled dogs known also as sleigh dogs sledge dogs or sleddogs are types of dogs that are used to pull a wheel less vehicle on runners over snow or ice by means of harnesses and lines The origins of this arrangement are unknown

A ten dog team of Seppala Siberian Sleddogs in tandem hitch on a frozen Yukon lakeSeveral distinct dog breeds are in common use as sled dogs although any medium sized breed may be used to pull a sled Purebred sled dog breeds range from the well known Siberian Husky and Alaskan Malamute to rarer breeds such as the Mackenzie River Husky Dog drivers however have a long history of using other breeds or crossbreds as sled dogs In the days of the Gold Rush in The Yukon mongrel teams were the rule but there were also teams of Foxhounds and Staghounds Today the unregistered hybridized Alaskan husky is preferred for dogsled racing along with a variety of crossbreds the German Shorthaired Pointer often being chosen as the basis for crossbreeding From 1988 through 1991 a team of Standard Poodles competed in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race

Sled dogs are expected to demonstrate two major qualities in their work Endurance is needed to travel the distances demanded in dogsled travel which may be anything from five to eighty miles or more a day Speed is needed to travel the distance in a reasonable length of time Racing sled dogs will travel up to an average twenty miles per hour over distances up to 25 miles Over longer distances average traveling speed declines to 10 to 14 miles per hour In poor trail conditions sleddogs can still usually average 6 or 7 miles per hour Sled dogs have been known to travel over 90 miles in a 24 hour period while pulling 85 pounds each

Royal Canadian Mounted Police hitching sled dogs into their harnessSleddogs pull various sorts of sleds from the small 25 pound sprint racing sleds through the larger plastic bottomed distance racing toboggan sleds to traditional ash freighting sleds and the trappers high fronted narrow toboggan Sled dogs are also used to pull skiers and to draw wheeled rigs when there is no snow A team of sled dogs may consist of anywhere from three to two dozen animals Modern teams are usually hitched in tandem with harnessed pairs of sled dogs pulling on tug lines attached to a central gangline Trappers in deep snow conditions using the toboggan will hitch their dogs in single file with traces on either side of the line of dogs Dog teams of some Arctic natives are run in fan hitch each dog having its own tow line tied directly to the sled

Driving sled dogs has become a popular winter recreation and sport in North America and Europe sled dogs are now found even in such unlikely places as Australia and Patagonia

  History of Sled Dogs  

During the 1925 serum run to Nome also known as the Great Race of Mercy 20 mushers and about 150 sled dogs relayed diphtheria antitoxin 674 miles by dog sled across the US territory of Alaska in a record breaking five and a half days saving the small city of Nome and the surrounding communities from an incipient epidemic Both the mushers and their dogs were portrayed as heroes in the newly popular medium of radio and received headline coverage in newspapers across the United States Balto the lead sled dog on the final stretch into Nome became the most famous canine celebrity of the era after Rin Tin Tin and his statue is still one of the most popular tourist attractions in New York Citys Central Park The publicity also helped spur an inoculation campaign in the US that dramatically reduced the threat of the disease

The sled dog was the primary means of transportation and communication in sub Arctic communities around the world and the race became both the last great hurrah and the most famous event in the history of mushing before first aircraft in the 1930s and then the snowmobile in the 1960s drove the dog sled almost into extinction The resurgence of recreational mushing in Alaska since the 1970s is a direct result of the tremendous popularity of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race which honors the history of dog mushing with many traditions that commemorate the serum run

The film Citizen Kane by Orson Welles tells the story about William Randolph Hearst

Joseph Joe Pulitzer was an American publisher Most people link the word Pulitzer to the Pulitzer Prizes These prizes were established by his will after his death He is also known for starting yellow journalism 

Joseph Pulitzer was born in Mak in present day Hungary Originally he wanted to do a military career but was turned down by the Austrian army They said his health was bad and that he did not see too well He went to live in the United States in 1864 to serve in the American Civil War After the war he settled in St Louis Missouri In 1868 he began working there for a German language daily newspaper the Westliche Post He joined the Republican Party and was elected to the Missouri State Assembly in 1869 In 1872 Pulitzer bought the Post for 3000 Then in 1878 he bought the St Louis Dispatch for 2700 and merged the two papers which became the St Louis Post Dispatch which remains St Louis daily newspaper It was at the Post Dispatch that Pulitzer developed his role as a champion of the common man with exposs and a hard hitting populist approach 

By 1883 Pulitzer had made a lot of money In that year he bought the New York World That newspaper had been losing 40000 a year He paid 346000 to Jay Gould the owner Pulitzer changed its focus to human interest stories scandal and sensationalism In 1885 he was elected to the US House of Representatives but resigned after a few months service He did not like politics In 1887 he recruited the famous investigative journalist Nellie Bly In 1895 the World introduced the popular Yellow Kid comic by Richard F Outcault This was the first newspaper comic printed with color Under Pulitzers leadership circulation grew from 15000 to 600000 making the New Your World the largest newspaper in the country 

The editor of the rival New York Sun attacked Pulitzer in print He calling him The Jew who gave up his religionThis was in 1890 This was intended to turn away Pulitzers Jewish readership Pulitzers already failing health deteriorated rapidly and he left the newsroom He continued to actively manage the paper from his vacation retreat in Bar Harbor Maine and his New York mansion 

In 1895 William Randolph Hearst purchased the rival New York Journal which led to a circulation war This competition with Hearst particularly the coverage before and during the Spanish American War linked Pulitzers name with yellow journalism

The Arachnids are a class of eight legged arthropods They are a highly successful group of mainly terrestrial invertebrates spiders scorpions harvestmen ticks and mites and a number of smaller groups

Almost all adult arachnids have eight legs and arachnids may be easily distinguished from insects by this fact since insects have six legs However arachnids also have two further pairs of appendages that have become adapted for feeding defense and sensory perception The first pair the chelicerae serve in feeding and defense The next pair of appendages the pedipalps have been adapted for feeding locomotion andor reproductive functions 

Like all arthropods arachnids have an exoskeleton They also have an internal structure of cartilage like tissue to which certain muscle groups are attached

Arachnids have no antennae or wings Their body is organized into two parts the cephalothorax and the abdomen 

There are some adaptations for life on land They have internal respiratory surfaces These may be trachea or a modification of gills into a book lung This is an internal series of lamellae used for gas exchange with the air 

Arachnids are mostly carnivorous feeding on the pre digested bodies of insects and other small animals Only the harvestmen and some mites eat solid food particles Predigestion avoids exposure to internal parasites Several groups secrete venom from specialized glands to kill prey or enemies Several mites are external parasites some of which are carriers of disease

Arachnids pour digestive juices produced in their stomachs over their prey after killing it with their pedipalps and chelicerae The digestive juices rapidly turn the prey into a broth of nutrients which the arachnid sucks into a pre buccal cavity located immediately in front of the mouth Behind the mouth is a muscular sclerotised pharynx which acts as a pump sucking the food through the mouth and on into the oesophagus and stomach In some arachnids the oesophagus also acts as an additional pump

The word Arachnida comes from the Greek for spider In legend a girl called Arachne was turned into a spider by the goddess Athena Arachne said shed win a weaving contest against the goddess Arachne won but the Athena got mad and made her a spider for challenging a goddess

Arthropods are made up of 4 groups of living animals and one group of extinct animals The 4 groups are insects arachnids crustaceans and myriapods The trilobites are extinct and they are the second most famous type of fossils after the dinosaurs

The problem is that A could be any number 00 is said to be of indeterminate form for this reason because it has no single value Numbers of the form A0 on the other hand where A is not 0 are said to be undefined This is because any attempt to define them will result in a value of infinity which is itself undefined Usually when two numbers are equal to the same thing they are equal to each other That is not true when the thing they are both equal to is 00 This means that the normal rules of maths do not work when the number is divided by zero

It is possible to disguise a special case of division by zero in an algebraic argument This can lead to invalid proofs such as 12 as in the following

The fallacy is the assumption that dividing by 0 is a legitimate operation with 00 1

The proof above is incorrect because it divides by zero when it divides by x x because any number minus itself is zero 

Flamenco pa tos is a Spanish festival of Flamenco music It is organized by the Gomaespuma Foundation This festival is the most important festival in Spain The profits of the festival are used by the Gomaespuma Foundation to help children in Managua The Festival has been the winner of the National Awards of Flamenco during 2004 and 2005

In music a note is a small bit of sound similar to a syllable in speaking a language For example in the first two lines of the song Twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you are there are 14 notes one for each syllable

Confusingly the word note can also mean the pitch of a note For example the whole of the song Twinkle twinkle little star can be played using six different notes C D E F G and A 

The word note can also mean the written symbol of the note

Nearly all music is made up of notes Music without notes might be sound effects

In most Western countries the notes are given a letter of the alphabet according to their pitch From lowest sounding to highest sounding A B C D E F G This pattern repeats so that after G will come A This A is an octave higher than the first A

Because there are 12 notes needed in Western music these 7 notes can have modifiers The two main modifiers are sharps which raise the pitch a half step and flats which lower the pitch a half step The symbol for a sharp is The symbol for a flat is  To un flat or un sharp a note the natural symbol is written before the note When writing in words the symbols are written after the note name for example B means B flat and F represents F sharp However when writing in music notation the flat sharp or natural signs are written BEFORE the note A way to remember this is to say if the sign came after the note it would be too late and you would have already played it so it must go before so that you know what is coming

Sharps and flats can also be written in key signatures A key signature is written at the beginning of the piece and repeated at the beginning of each line It gives the sharps or flats which are going to be regular in the piece

Two other modifiers are double sharps which raise the note a whole step and double flats which lower the note a whole step These are much less common that the simple sharp or flat but can still be seen in some types of music The symbol for a double sharp is and the symbol for a double flat is For example E is another name for D This is called an enharmonic equivalent Another enharmonic equivalent is C and B

In Italy and some other countries notes are named Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si instead of C D E F G A B This notation is called solfege in the United States These notes are the focus for a song in The Sound of Music

Drum Kits do not have notes they have places on the manuscript where each line means each Drum each symbol means each Cymbak on the Kit  how Many Times to hit it in what speed and beats in a bar there are usually shown as 44 and you count 1 2 3 4 each bar

Veronica Taylor provided the voice of Ash in seasons one through eight of the English adaption of the Pokmon anime After the script is translated from Japanese the lines are adapted to fit the movements of the characters mouth All the voices were recorded separately so Taylor was the only one in the booth when she recorded her lines which took approximately six to eight hours Taylor was often the first person to record so she had to imagine how the previous line will be said Luckily I work with a great director who helps with the interpretation of the line matching of the lip flap and consistency of the voice Taylor enjoyed playing Ash because of his low husky voice and energy and excitement

Taylor commented that Ash and the other characters loosened up after the first ten episodes of the anime she believed the writers were more relaxed and did no longer feel the pressure of making sure everything was done correctly Taylor commented I enjoy playing Ash now much more than I did in the very beginning because I can have fun with him more and we kind of know him and can work out how he really would react We have the classic Ash responses and things like that Sarah Natochenny replaced Taylor in season nine when Pokmon International took over the dubbing rights In Japan Rica Matsumoto provides the voice of Ash

Red the silent protagonist of Pokmon Red Blue and Yellow and its remakes Pokmon FireRed and LeafGreen has several default names one of which is Red Others include Ash and Jack In the game Red is a young boy from Pallet Town His adventure begins one day when Professor Oak calls the two of them to his lab and gives them each a choice of Pokmon After receiving their Pokmon Blue challenges Red to a battle Later Professor Oak summons both Red and Blue and gives them both a Pokdex each and sends them on a journey to fulfill his dream of capturing every type of Pokmon

Ash has considerably improved his abilities as a trainer over the course of the series However his earnestness and determination remain the same During the first season of the series Ash trained to catch more Pokmon than his childhood rival Gary Oak although Gary was always shown to be the stronger trainer He soon began to focus more on each of his Pokmons abilities Ashs primary nemesis is a group of antagonists named Team Rocket Ever since the second episode Pokmon Emergency two Team Rocket operatives named Jessie and James along with a talking Meowth have tried to steal his first Pokmon Pikachu as well as many others but have always failed Despite their constant antagonism they occasionally put their differences aside and work together against a common adversary such as in Pokmon The Movie 2000 where they aid Ash in retrieving the three treasures in order to save the world

The portrayals of Ash in the manga The Electric Tale of Pikachu Pocket Monster Zensho and Ash Pikachu are very similar to the one in the anime There are key differences in the manga though In The Electric Tale of Pikachu it is based on Ashs journey up until the end of the Orange Islands travel Ash is usually seen traveling by himself during the course of this manga although he is joined by Misty and Brock in Indigo sometimes Misty is the only one to join Ash in the Orange Islands At the end of the series The Ash Pikachu manga is similar although it has the episodes from the anime like The Fortune Hunters and A Goldenrod Opportunity combined but with a couple of changes In Pocket Monsters Zensho Satoshi starts with Charmander instead of Pikachu The manga ends at the Indigo Plateau where Satoshi defeats the Elite Four Manga author Toshihiro Ono cited Ash as one of his favorite characters to draw for the series stating I want to go on a trip with Misty just like him

In the Pokmon Adventures manga Red is a Pokmon trainer and the protagonist of the first saga Red starts off in Pallet Town as an aspiring trainer and gets a Bulbasaur and a Pokdex from Professor Oak He also has a Poliwhirl which he has known since childhood that evolves into a Poliwrath and uses these two Pokmon on his adventure He later captures a mischievous Pikachu and after working to gain its trust it becomes one of Reds top three Pokmon Antagonists include his rival Oaks grandson Blue who was granted Charmander Green another Pokmon trainer from Pallet Town who stole a Squirtle from Professor Oak and Team Rocket an organization bent on world domination through Pokmon

The book The Japanification of Childrens Popular Culture cited Ash as an example of consumer identification with the character going through similar motions players of the games had to in order to progress through them It additionally emphasized the characters growth and development as the anime series progressed

The Mtis also known as Bois Brule mixed bloods or Countryborn are one of the three divisions of Aboriginal peoples in Canada according to the Canadian government Their home land is in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia Alberta Saskatchewan ManitobaOntarioQuebec New Brunswick Nova Scotia as well as the Northwest Territories The Mtis Homeland also includes parts of the northern United States The Mtis Nation are descendants of marriages of Woodland Cree Ojibway SaulteauxMikmaq and Menominee Indians with French Canadian andor BritishCeltic settlers Their history starts in the mid 1700s in the west and starts in the early 1600s in the east Historically many Mtis spoke a mixed language called Michif Michif is the Mtis pronunciation of Mtis The Mtis today mostly speak English with French as a strong second language as well as many native language The use of Michif is growing again thanks to the work of the provincial Mtis councils

The word Mtis is French and related to the Spanish word mestizo It means the same thing mixed blood both names come from the Latin word mixtus mixed 

It is hard to say how many Mtis people in Canada and the United States have Mtis ancestors but it is more than can be known 

Mtis culture is an mixture of cultures of the First Nations French Canadian English and OrkneyScottish The Mtis are known for their love of fiddle playing but traditional instruments also included the concertina the harmonica and the hand drum This love for the fiddle has gone together with a kind of dancing called jigging Traditionally dancing included such moves as the Waltz Quadrille the Square dance Drops of Brandy the Duck La Double Gigue and the Red River Jig 

Metis people were famous for their horsemanship and breeding of horsesFactdateMarch 2007 The RCMP Musical Ride horses dance the Quadrille as begun by the Metis and their horses

As the Mtis culture grew a new language called Michif was spoken This language was a result of the combining of French nouns and Cree verbs Though a distinct language it is spoken by few people Some guess that the number of Michif speakers is about 1000 

The sash recognized as the symbol of the Mtis nation in Western Canada has long been a part of Mtis culture in the Maritimes Originally made of vegetable fibres Mikmaq women created colourful sashes using a finger weaving technique Later the Assomption style sashes were brought from Quebec and adopted by both Mtis and Mikmaq alike 

The clothing worn by Mtis in the 19th century included the sash or ceinture fleche It is traditionally about three metres in length and is made by weaving yarn together with ones fingers The sash is worn around the waist tied in the middle with the fringed ends hanging Vests with Mtis beadwork are also popular The Red River Coat came from the Metis culture

The Mtis were important in Canadas past as fur traders who came from the east coast voyageurs frontiersmen pioneers and middlemen who communicated between the First Nations peoples and cultures and the European settlers and colonists

The most famous Mtis was Louis Riel who led two rebellions the Red River Rebellion in 1869 in the area now known as Manitoba and the North West Rebellion in 1885 in the area now known as Saskatchewan Some say these were not really rebellions For example in 1869 Riel was the leader of a government recognized by Canada as controlling territory that did not belong to Canada Canada worked on the Manitoba Act with this government After these rebellions land claimers and other non Mtis took away the Mtis land by taking advantage of a government program for buying it with the government letting this happen The province of Alberta gave some land to Mtis in 1938 to fix what it thought was not fair but Saskatchewan and Manitoba have not done the same

Two other famous Mtis leaders were Cuthbert Grant and Gabriel Dumont

Born in 1940 in northern Saskatchewan Metis writer and filmmaker Maria Campbell brought attention to the struggles of modern day Metis and Aboriginal people with her book Halfbreed and the play Jessica She has shown the sound and song of traditional stories through her work in dialect Stories of the Road Allowance People

On May 7 2004 Mtis Todd Ducharme became a judge of the Ontario Supreme Court of Justice

A disaster is something very bad that happens to people and almost always changes their lives completely Disasters can destroy homes and many kinds of work Disasters can be of different kinds but most are caused by forces of nature

These may include avalanches cold diseases droughts earthquakes famine fire that burns things and people flood hail heat that lowers the water supply hurricanes that break everything the hyper nova of a star that kills life an impact event where meteors hit the earth a limnic eruption landslides and mudslides sink holes solar flares storm surge thunderstorms tornadoes tsunami volcanoes a waterspout or winter storms

Disasters caused by humans include aviation accidents arson CBRNs civil disorder power outages public relations crises where a company must tell bad news radiation contamination disasters in space a telecommunications outage terrorism and war

To live through a disaster it is important that your family and your city prepare in advance This may be making a pack of things you need in an emergency it may be a government sending soldiers to help or it may be something in between

Theories vary widely about the cause of world disasters and while most are controversial the amount of followers that they attract show that there is perhaps some merit behind them One notable theorist is named Fei Weixiang Feis theory centers around the idea that all world disasters stem from a single source He believes he has tracked the source to Beijing where he currently resides

Java is a programming language for computers that can run on many different machines including mobile phones It was created by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995 Small Java programs called applets usually run inside web browsers Java is currently one of the most popular programming languages in use particularly for client server web applications

Java is not the same as JavaScript JavaScript is a scripting language mainly used by web browsers

Java is object oriented Java code looks a lot like C or C code Unchanged C or C code will not work in Java in most cases

Java can run on many different operating systems This makes Java platform independent Java does this by making the Java compiler turn code into Java bytecode instead of machine code This means that when the program is executed the Java Virtual Machine interprets the bytecode and translates it into machine code

When Java was developed this was done to reach five goals

The Java platform refers to a group of software products from Sun Microsystems The platform is used to develop and run Java programs The platform includes the execution engine that allows Java programs to do the same thing on different computer systems

There are many types of Java programs which run differently

The programming language Java has also been criticised Some of the criticisms are

The eon is a very very long time It is used as the name for a part of the Earths existence lasting many millions of years

In the science of geology a geologic eon is part of Earths existence made up of a number of eras which are of different lengths A geologic era is made up of two or more shorter times called geologic periods A geologic period is in turn made up of yet shorter times called geologic epochs 

Geologists have given names to all of the eons eras periods and epochs that they have found by looking at rocks The names given to each eon describe something about that time or the rocks that were made at that time

For example we are now in the Phanerozoic Eon which comes from the Greek words for life that we can see that is there were animals and plants big enough to see without a lens This era started about 545 million years ago

The Bhagavad Gita is being showed as holy book of Hinduism It was written thousands of years ago  It has teachings said to be given by LORD Krishna In the book Krishna is talking to Arjuna an archer before the kurukshetra war begins Krishna tells Arjuna that he must perform his duty for his caste and go to fight Arjuna hesitates because he is fighting his friends but in the end he listens to Krishna He will not be led into the underworld for ever for his sins because he will now be reincarnated

It was said to be holy book of hinduism only in 18th century when christianity was spread over indian subcontinent with an institutional form having a unique holy book bible To make a institutional form to hinduism bhagavad gita was uplift and said to be the unique holy book of hinduism

The Upanishads are some of the sacred books of the Hindu people The Upanishads are part of a large collection of sacred books of Hindu people called the Vedas They are place at the end of the Vedas and they primarily deal with knowledge or wisdom Because they deal with knowledge portion of the Vedas they are called Jnana Kanda Also because they come at the end portion of the Vedas they are often called as texts of Vedanta Upanishads form the foundation of the philosophy of Hindu religion 

The Upanishads are very well known around the world They describe the fact that the humans should try to learn more and understand more about God 

The Upanishads do not belong to a specific period of Sanskrit literature The oldest such as the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad and Chandogya Upanishad may be as old as 8th century BC while the youngest depending on the specific Upanishad may date to the medieval or early modern period

A concert is a performance in which a musician or many musicians play music together to a group of listeners In the case of a concert of classical music there may be an orchestra There is often an important visual element to the performance such as with a rock concert However if acting out a story is an important part of the performance then this is called theatre or opera but some concerts have dramatic theatrical music with lights and special effects Informal names for a concert include show or sometimes gig for musicians who play in lots of different concerts with different groups A concert tour is a set of concerts where the performers travel to different cities or towns

The performers at a concert are usually raised above the level of the audience on a stage Concerts may be held in concert halls which are built for the purpose or they may be held in any other suitable large building such as a school hall a nightclub a barn or a large house or castle Some concerts are given to very large audiences in the open air They may take place in a field or in a stadium The music for these open airs is usually amplified by loudspeakers so that large audiences can hear it

A concert given by just one performer is usually called a recital

A group of concerts in one place or in one area that takes place for several days may be called a festival Examples are The Proms the Edinburgh Festival the Glastonbury Festival etc

Before the days of recording a concert would have been the only opportunity most people would have of hearing concerts given by groups

Usually people who go to a concert have to pay an admission charge The money that is made from the ticket sales will usually go to paying the performing artistes producers and organisers However there are also benefit concerts where either the proceeds or profits will go to charity Tickets for concerts can often be bought at the box office of the concert hall or bought online Sometimes concerts are free

The nature of a concert will vary by musical genre and the individual performers Concerts by a small jazz combo or small bluegrass band may have the same order of program mood and volume but vary in music and dress In a similar way a particular musician band or genre of music might attract concert attendees with similar dress hairstyle and behavior For example the hippies of the 60s often toted long hair sandals and inexpensive clothing made of natural fibers The regular attendees to a concert venue might also have a recognizable style comprising that venues scene

Some performers or groups put on very elaborate and expensive affairs with parts of the show being similar to a theater performance In order to create a memorable and exciting atmosphere and increase the spectacle artists will have additional entertainment devices within their concerts These tend to include elaborate stage lighting an image magnification system andor pre recorded video inflatables artwork or other set pieces various special effects such as theatrical smoke and fog and pyrotechnics and unusual costumes or wardrobe Some singers especially in genres of popular music augment the sound of their concerts with pre recorded accompaniment back up dancers and even broadcast vocal tracks of the singers own voice Activities which may take place during these concerts include dancing sing alongs and moshing Some performers well known for including these elements in their performances include Pink Floyd Jean Michel Jarre Sarah Brightman and KISS

Concerts involving a greater number of artists especially those that last for days are known as festivals Unlike other concerts which typically remain in a single genre of music or work of a particular artist festivals often cover a broad scope of music and arts Due to their size festivals are almost always held outdoors A few examples of the hundreds of festivals include Bayreuth Festival Big Day Out Coachella Falls Festival Glastonbury Festival Mostly Mozart Festival Newport Jazz Festival Oxegen Parachute Music Festival Rock In Rio Rockwave Festival Salzburg Festival Summer Sonic Festival Tanglewood Music Festival Woodstock Music and Art Festival the Warped Tour or the Umbria Jazz Festival

 Concert tour 

A concert tour is a series of concerts by an artist or group of artists in different cities or locations Often concert tours are named to differentiate different tours by the same artist and associate a specific tour with a particular album or product Especially in the popular music world such tours can become large scale enterprises that last for several months or even years They are seen by thousands or millions of people and bring in millions of dollars in ticket revenues 

Different segments of longer concert tours are known as legs The different legs of a tour are denoted in different ways dependant on the artist and type of tour but the most common means of separating legs are dates countries andor continents or different opening acts In the largest concert tours it is becoming more common for different legs to employ separate touring production crews and equipment local to each geographical region Concert tours are often managed on the local level by concert promoters or by performing arts presenters

While admission to some concerts is free it is common practice to charge money for concerts by selling admission tickets Historically concerts were the primary source of revenue for musicians Revenue from ticket sales typically goes to the performing artists producers venue and organizers In the case of benefit concerts a portion of profits will often go towards a charitable organization

Additional revenue is also often raised through in concert advertising from free local concerts for local sponsorships to sponsorships from corporations during major tours such as 2009s Vans Warped Tour Presented by ATT Both Vans and ATT would have paid significant amounts to have their company names included at the forefront in all marketing material for the Warped Tour

Concessions and merchandise are also often sold during and after concerts often by the venue in the case of the former and by the performing band or artist in the case of the latter

The highest grossing concert tour of all time is The Rolling Stones A Bigger Bang Tour which earned approximately 558 million in between 2005 and 2007 The highest earning tour by a solo artist is the Sticky Sweet Tour by pop artist Madonna which earned 408 million in 2008 and 2009

Palm trees are a family of plants This family is called Arecaceae Most of them are trees but some are shrubs They grow in hot climates but some have been planted as far north as Britain

Well known palm trees are

There are over two thousand kinds living in many kinds of places from rainforests to deserts 

Palms are one of the most well known and widely planted tree families They have had an important role to humans throughout much of history Many common products and foods come from palms and they are also used a lot in parks and gardens in areas that do not have heavy frosts 

In historical times palms have been symbols for victory peace and fertility Today palms remain a popular symbol for the tropics and vacations 

Most palms are a straight unbranched stem but sometimes a branching stem or even a creeping vine such as the rattan They have large evergreen leaves that are either fan leaved or feather leaved and arranged in a spiral at the top of the trunk The leaves have a tubular sheath at the base that usually splits open on one side when it is grown The flowers grow on an inflorescence a special branch just for carrying the great number of tiny flowers The flowers are generally small and white and are star shaped The sepals and petals usually number three each The fruit is usually a single seed surrounded by flesh The familiar coconut is the seed of a large fruit Some kinds may contain two or more seeds in each fruit

Over two thirds of palms live in tropical forests where some species grow tall enough to form part of the canopy and other shorter palms form part of the understory Some kinds form pure stands in areas with poor drainage or regular flooding Other palms live on tropical mountains above 1000 meters Palms may also live in grasslands and scrublands usually where there is water and in desert oases A few palms are adapted to extremely basic lime soils while others are similarly adapted to very acidic soils 

The Coco de mer has the largest seeds of any plant 30 50 centimeters in diameter and weighing 15 30 kilograms each Raffia palms with leaves up to 25 meters long and 3 meters wide have the largest leaves of any plant The Corypha palms have the largest inflorescence of any plant up to 75 meters tall and containing millions of small flowers The wax palm Colombias national tree is the tallest palm in the world reaching heights of 70 meters 

Palms first appear in the fossil record around 80 million years ago during the late Cretaceous Period Some kinds from that period are still to be seen today such as the nipa palm or mangrove palm

Like many other plants some palms are in danger of dying out because of human activity The greatest dangers are from Increasingly large cities mining and turning forests into farmland The harvesting of heart of palm for food also poses a threat because it comes from the inner core of the tree and harvesting it kills the tree The use of rattan palms in furniture has caused a big fall in the number of rattan palms as they are collected from the wild instead of being farmed The sale of wild seeds to growers and collectors is another threat 

At least a hundred kinds are in danger and nine kinds are said to have recently died out 

It is very hard to save palm seeds because they are killed by cooling them which is the normal way of keeping rare seeds for the future Also planting rare kinds in parks can never truly recreate the wild areas they come from and the plants may not do well in these parks 

The Palm Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union started in 1984 supported by the WWF The group gathered a lot of information from different parts of the world An action plan to save rare palms was made by this group in 1996

Human use of palms is as old as or even or older than civilization itself starting with the growing of date palms by Mesopotamians and other Middle Eastern peoples 5000 years or more ago The Date Palm had a great effect on the history of the Middle East Historian WH Barreveld wrote

The early importance of palms in the Middle East is shown in scripture They are mentioned more than 30 times in the Bible and more than 22 times in the Koran 

Apart from the well known coconut and date there are other kinds of food from palms Palm oil Sago heart of palm and palm wine are all eaten or drunk in different parts of the world Palm oil is used in everything from cosmetics to food ingredients

South Carolina is nicknamed the Palmetto State after the sabal palmetto logs from which were used to build the fort at Fort Moultrie During the American Revolutionary War their spongy wood helped stop the British cannonballs

Coir is a coarse water resistant fibre from the outer shell of coconuts It is used in doormats brushes mattresses and ropes Dragons blood is a resin used in dyes varnishes and incense can come from the fruit of the rattan The Washingtonia robusta trees line Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica California

Today palms are popular in parks and gardens in countries outside the tropics two of the most cold tolerant species are the Chusan palm from eastern Asia and the needle palm from the United States 

The palm branch was a symbol of triumph and victory in Roman times The Romans rewarded champions of the games and celebrated success in war with palm branches 

Jews also had a tradition of carrying palm branches during festive times

The motto of the University of Southern California is Palmam qui meruit ferat which means in Latin Let him bear the palm who has deserved it 

Palms appear on the flags and seals of several countries where they are native including those of Haiti Guam Florida South Carolina and Samoa

The palm has many meanings in both ancient and modern Middle Eastern religions

Early Christians used the palm branch to symbolize the victory of the faithful over enemies of the soul as in the Palm Sunday festival celebrating the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem 

In Christian art martyrs were usually shown holding palms representing the victory of spirit over flesh and it was widely believed that a picture of a palm on a tomb meant that a martyr was buried there Origen calls the palm the symbol of victory in that war waged by the spirit against the flesh In this sense it was especially applicable to martyrs the victors par excellence over the spiritual foes of mankind hence the frequent occurrence in the Acts of the martyrs of such expressions as he received the palm of martyrdom

In Judaism the palm represents peace and plenty The palm may also symbolize the Tree of Life in Kabbalah 

Prophet Muhammad is said to have built his home out of palm and the palm represents rest and hospitality in many cultures of the Middle East 

Palm stems represented long life to the Ancient Egyptians and the god Huh was often shown holding a palm stem in one or both hands

The sacred tree of the Assyrians was a palm that represents the god Ishtar connecting heaven the crown of the tree and earth the base of the trunk The Mesopotamian goddess Inanna who had a part in the sacred marriage ritual was thought of as the one who made the dates abundant 

The palm tree was a sacred sign of Apollo in Ancient Greece because he had been born under one 

The palm especially the Coconut remains a symbol of tropical island paradise 

The palm tree also represents Oasis

 Cultural significance  Rabindranath tagore has written a long famous poem about a special genus of palm tree

Io is a mistress of Zeus Hera almost caught Io and Zeus together but Zeus hid Io by turning her into a cow Hera was not fooled and said that Zeus had to give her the cow as a present Once Io belonged to Hera she was looked after by Argus It was Arguss job to make sure that Io and Zeus were never together Zeus ordered Hermes to kill Argus so that Io would be free Hermes did this by killing Argus after he had been lulled to sleep Hera then sent a gadfly to sting Io as she walked about on the earth

Lamia is a queen of Libya who Zeus was in love with Hera was jealous of Lamia and turned her into a monster When she was a monster Lamia then killed her children Another version of this story is that Hera killed Lamias children and was then so sad that she turned into a monster Hera also put a curse on Lamia The curse was that Lamia could not close her eyes Hera choose this curse because she wanted Lamia to always think about the picture of her dead children Zeus then gave Lamia the gift of being able to take her eyes out so that she could rest She could then put them back in again afterwards

When Hera found out that Leto was pregnant with twins by Zeus she was angry She banned Leto from giving birth on any mainland or island that was known Leto found a floating island called Dellos It was neither a mainland or a real island so Leto was allowed to give birth there Artemis was born first who then helped Leto to give birth to Apollo Dellos was later held down with four pillars so that it would not float around anymore It is said to be surrounded by swans and later became a sacred place to Apollo

A mirror or looking glass is something that reflects light One common plane mirror is a piece of special flat glass that a person can look into in order to see themselves or what is behind them

Sometimes a flat piece of metal or the surface of water can act like a mirror

The reason you are able to see yourself in a mirror is because light comes in and gets reflected and thats how you are able to see your reflection Mirrors can have magnification properties making images appear smaller or larger than their actual size They can also be concave or convex making the reflected angle and view to be smaller or larger respectively

Special mirrors in a museum are good to check out Some make a persons appearance look quite strange Also in a mirror writing appears backwards as a mirror image of the original writing

Mirrors are usually made out of sand in the manner glass is made but some mirrors have been made of polished metal to show a nearly clear view

Mirrors with a curved surface can make things appear bigger or smaller like a lens does

A space probe is an unmanned space mission usually a small spacecraft sent out to find out information about a planet Space probes can be sent to space because to find information about other galaxies The probe will then send this information back to Earth or a manned spacecraft

The Ford Motor Company is an American company that makes vehicles This company is named after its founder Henry Ford

Fords first car was made in 1908 It was called a Model T

These car makers are also owned by Ford

In 1896 Henry Ford had an idea to make a Quadricycle the first horseless carriage he built This four wheeled vehicle was very different from cars we drive now It was very different even from vehicles Ford produced just a few years later Nevertheless this marked the start of Fords career as a businessman Until the Quadricycle Fords tinkering had been experimental and theoretical For example in the 1890s Ford built a gas engine on his kitchen tablejust an engine with nothing to power Enough people liked the Quadricycle and much could be done with the it so it led to the beginning of Fords business

Ford Motor Company started on June 16 1903 when Henry Ford and 11 business helpers signed the companys formation papers The first Ford production car the Model A was sold in Detroit Michigan a few months later With 280000 the pioneering industrialists made what was to become one of the worlds largest companies Few enterprises helped shape the history and development of industry and society in the 20th century as did Ford Motor Company

Perhaps Ford Motor Companys single greatest contribution to automotive manufacturing was the assembly line First implemented at the Highland Park plant in 1913 this new technique allowed individual workers to stay in one place to perform the same task repeatedly on multiple vehicles as they passed on the assembly line The line proved tremendously efficient it helped the company far surpass production levels of its competitors Ford had discovered how to produce more affordable vehicles

Henry Ford insisted that the companys future lay in the production of affordable cars for a mass market In 1903 the company began using the first 19 letters of the alphabet to name new cars In 1908 the Model T was born 19 years and 15 million Model Ts later Ford Motor Company was a giant industrial complex which spanned the globe In 1925 Ford Motor Company acquired the Lincoln Motor Company under which name it built luxury cars In the 1930s the name freddie Mercury was given to a division centered on mid priced cars Ford Motor Company was growing

John Constable was a famous English painter and artist 

His family had plenty of money because his father owned a business running corn mills Constables father wanted his son to take over the business after him but Constable started painting at an early age and convinced his father to let him follow art as a career

He married Maria Bicknell in 1816 and they had seven children She died in 1829 of Tuberculosis

His paintings are treasures of British art but in his lifetime his work was appreciated more in France Constables most famous painting The Hay Wain was first shown at the Paris Salon in 1824 He had to wait until he was 52 years old before the Royal Academy voted that he should be a member

Constable was influenced by the French painter Claude Lorrain His most famous paintings are landscapes showing the countryside around Dedham and Flatford where his fathers mills were

Constables idea was to use nature itself rather than imagination He told Leslie When I sit down to make a sketch from nature the first thing I try to do is to forget that I have ever seen a picturep51

Although Constable produced paintings throughout his life for the market of patrons and RA exhibitions on the spot studies were essential He never just followed a formula The world is wide he wrote no two days are alike nor even two hours neither were there ever two leaves of a tree alike since the creation of all the world and the genuine productions of art like those of nature are all distinct from each otherp64

Constable painted many full scale preliminary sketches of his landscapes in order to test the composition in advance of finished pictures These large sketches with their free and vigorous brushwork were revolutionary at the time The sketches for The Leaping Horse and The Hay Wain study convey a vigour missing from his finished oil paintings of the same subjects Compare the composition of this preliminary study with the finished painting The Hay Wain final Possibly more than any other aspect of Constables work the oil sketches reveal him to be an avant garde painter one who showed that landscape painting could be taken in a totally new direction

Constables watercolours were also remarkably free for their time The almost mystical Stonehenge 1835 with its double rainbow is often considered to be one of the greatest watercolours ever painted When he exhibited it in 1836 Constable appended a text to the title The mysterious monument of Stonehenge standing remote on a bare and boundless heath as much unconnected with the events of past ages as it is with the uses of the present carries you back beyond all historical records into the obscurity of a totally unknown periodp89

In addition to the full scale oil sketches Constable completed numerous studies of landscapes and clouds to become more scientific in his recording of atmospheric conditions The The Chain Pier 1827 for example prompted a critic to write the atmosphere possesses a characteristic humidity about it that almost imparts the wish for an umbrellap9 

The sketches were the first ever done in oils directly from the subject in the open air To convey the effects of light and movement Constable used broken brushstrokes often in small touches which he worked over lighter passages This gave an impression of sparkling light over the landscape One of the most expressionistic and powerful of all his studies is Seascape Study with Rain Cloud painted in around 1824 at Brighton which captures with slashing dark brushstrokes an exploding shower at seap128 Constable also became interested in painting rainbow effects for example in Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows 1831 and in Cottage at East Bergholt 1833

To the sky studies he added notes often on the back of the sketches of the prevailing weather conditions direction of light and time of day believing that the sky was the key note the standard of scale and the chief organ of sentiment in a landscape paintingp110 In this habit he is known to have been influenced by the pioneering work of the meteorologist Luke Howard on the classification of cloudsp68 I have done a good deal of skying Constable wrote to Fisher on 23 October 1821p56

Constable once wrote in a letter to Leslie My limited and abstracted art is to be found under every hedge and in every lane and therefore nobody thinks it worth picking upp129 He could never have imagined how influential his honest techniques would turn out to be Constables art inspired not only contemporaries like Gricault and Delacroix but the Barbizon School and the French impressionists of the late nineteenth century

A Beautiful Mind is a book and an Academy Award winning movie It is about the mathematician John Nash who won a Nobel Prize in Economics and his experiences of schizophrenia The biography was written by Sylvia Nasar 

The McGurk effect shows how hearing and vision are used for speech perception Named after the man who found it Harry McGurk it says that we do not hear speech with only our ears We use our other senses too The McGurk effect may be experienced when watching a video of a person saying ga with a sound recording saying ba When this is done a third sound is heard da 

The McGurk effect is robust that is it still works even if you know about it This is different from certain optical illusions which do not work anymore once you can see it

Joseph Mallord William Turner was an English painter and artist He was one of the greatest artists of landscape painting with a great mastery of light and colour

His father was a maker of wigs His mother was ill with mental problems and the young Turner was sent to live with his uncle in Brentford where he first started to paint

Turner became a student at the Royal Academy of Art school in London when he was 14 years old He was accepted into the Academy a year later He had a watercolour painting in 1790 in the Academys important art show He had only been studying for a year In 1802 at the age of only 28 he was elected a member of the Royal Academy and later became its Professor of Perspective 

In 1802 Turner travelled around Europe visiting France and Switzerland He also went to the Louvre in Paris During his life he often travelled across Europe visiting Venice in Italy several times As his personal style developed he began to produce paintings that were generalised or exaggerated in form and colour rather than realistic or detailed These caused much argument as to their artistic value but nowadays are his best loved works On his death he left 300 oils and 20000 watercolours to the British nation Some of his watercolours are the most abstract or generalised of his paintings

Turner never married although he had two children with his mistress Sarah Danby For much of his life he lived with his father who helped him in his studio until he died in 1829

In his early career Turner was influenced by the painters Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin who painted historical landscapes

Turner became interested in natural catastrophes and natural phenomena such as sunlight storm rain and fog He was fascinated by the violent power of the sea His paintings revolve around the light of the sun shown in infinite variety His work showed some of the ideas of the impressionists decades before they arrived on the scene Monet in particular studied Turners methods 

His most famous paintings include The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last berth to be broken up Often called just The Fighting Temeraire this is a picture of a famous warship that was used in the Battle of Trafalgar Other pictures include Rain Steam and Speed which shows a steam train crossing a bridge and Snowstorm which shows a steamship in a snowstorm trying to get into a harbour In order to get the right feeling into this painting he had himself tied to a ships mast during a storm so that he could see what it was like Some of his most famous paintings show the roughness of nature with bleak landscapes and violent storms

But also there is beauty and a sense of calmness in pictures such as Crossing the Brook a stunning scenic view of the Tamar Valley and River from New Bridge near Gunnislake in Cornwall painted in 1815 a view which can still be admired today 

As he grew older Turners behaviour became a bit odd and he became depressed quite often He died in Chelsea on 19 September 1851 and was buried next to the painter Joshua Reynolds in St Pauls Cathedral

Even while Turner was alive some people thought he was a genius Some people complained that the pictures he painted when he was older were not realistic and some even joked that they could have been painted with a mop However most think that his way of painting shows complete mastery

A mug is a container for liquids People might talk about getting a mug of beer at a local pub They might also drink a mug of coffee in the morning

Claude Monet was a French painter and artist One of his most famous paintings was called Water Lillies which he repeated many times in various conditions

Born in Paris France His father wanted him to help run the familys grocery business However Monet wanted to be an artist When he was young he met the painter Eugne Boudin who taught him to use oil paints and encouraged him to paint out of doors

Monet joined the French army in Algeria for two years from 1860 1862 When he became ill he left the army to study art at university He did not like the way art was taught and joined the painter Charles Gleyre in his studio He met other artists here including Pierre Auguste Renoir and Alfred Sisley They shared their ideas about painting

In 1866 Monet had a child with Camille Doncieux who had been his model They married in 1870 In 1870 he moved to England to escape the Franco Prussian War and in 1871 he moved to Argenteuil near Paris where he painted some of his most famous pictures In 1873 he painted Impression Sunrise showing the sea at Le Havre When this picture was shown in 1874 one critic took its title and called the group of artists Impressionists He intended to make fun of the artists but the name has stuck and this is what people today call this style of painting

In 1879 Camille died of tuberculosis Alice Hosched decided to help Monet by taking care of his children as well as her own In 1883 they moved to a house in Giverny where Monet planted a large garden Monet married Alice in 1892

Monet found that his garden inspired him to paint pictures of it particularly the water lilies Alice died in 1911 and his son Jean was killed in World War I in 1914 

Monet used broad brush strokes to build up his pictures and painted quite quickly to try and get the idea of the light he could see into his paintings If you go very close to one of his pictures it is hard to see what it shows but if you stand back everything becomes clear

His later paintings include series in which he paints the same subject in different light For example he painted a series of pictures of haystacks in a field and another series of pictures of the west front of Rouen Cathedral

Monet died of lung cancer in Giverny

Exodus is the second book in the Torah or Books of Moses Exodus in Hebrew is called Shmowt which means names 

Exodus means going out in Latin It is about how the Hebrew people were led out of Egypt by God Moses their leader hears Gods words and in turn tells to the Israelites Exodus ends with Gods laws and his instructions on how to build a holy container called the Ark of the Covenant

After the Hebrews went to Egypt to get food the Pharaoh made each Hebrew a slave The Pharaoh made the Hebrews work for them very hard and told them to throw their babies into the Nile River Moses who was put in a reed basket and later rescued by an Egyptian princess later killed a Egyptian slave driver He escaped from Egypt and lived away from his people in Midian for Jethro his father in law

One day while Moses was tending his flocks God appeared in a burning bush to Moses and instructs him to lead the Israelites out of Egypt As Moses had no confidence in doing this task God gives him his brother Aaron to help him Aaron was a good talker and helped Moses speak to the Pharaoh

When he returned to Egypt Moses asked the Pharaoh to let the Israelites go but the Pharaoh refused Through Gods power Moses causes ten plagues to come on Egypt

The last plague was the death of all the firstborns in Egypt Only the Israelites firstborns were spared as they have the blood of a young lamb on their door when this happened The Pharaoh finally decided to let the Israelites go 

While the Israelites were crossing the Red Sea the Pharaoh changed his mind and decided to pursue them with his troops The Israelites passed safely as Moses parted the Sea with his staff by Gods power but once they all passed the sea closed leaving all the Pharaohs troops to drown

Later at Mount Sinai Moses receives the law and the Ten Commandments from God The Israelites however sinned against God by worshiping an idol Moses breaks the first two stone tablets of the Ten Commandments in anger God later gives him another two He also instructs Moses how to build the Ark of the Covenant

The book has been filmed several times as The Ten Commandments and The Prince of Egypt

The Chernobyl disaster occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Pripyat Ukraine At that time Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union 

The event was the worst accident in the history of nuclear power Because there was no containment building to trap the radiation radioactive fallout drifted over parts of the western Soviet Union Eastern Europe Scandinavia the UK and the eastern United States Large areas of Ukraine Belarus and Russia were badly contaminated About 60 of the radioactive fallout landed in Belarus About 350000 people needed to be evacuated and moved to other places where they could live after the accident

The accident raised concerns about the safety of the Soviet nuclear power industry It slowed its expansion for some time It also forced the Soviet government to become less secretive Since then Russia Ukraine and Belarus became separate countries Those countries have been burdened with continuing costs for decontamination and health care because of the accident Exposure to radiation leads to a higher risk of getting cancer It is difficult to accurately tell the number of deaths caused by the events at Chernobyl The Chernobyl accident happened when some workers where testing the safety of the reactor Some of the devices that stopped the reactor from blowing up were switched off Then there was a power surge they lost control and the reactor blew up

Most of the people affected have not died yet When and if the people involved die of cancer or related diseases it will be hard to tell if this was because of the accident A 2005 IAEA report tells of 56 direct deaths 47 of those were accident workers and 9 were children who died of thyroid cancer The report estimates that up to 4000 people may die from long term diseases related to the accident Greenpeace along with others thinks that the studys conclusions may be false

Prypiat is an abandoned city in northern Ukraine It lies in Kiev Oblast near the border with Belarus It was home to Chernobyl nuclear power plant workers The city was abandoned in 1986 after the Chernobyl accident the worst nuclear reactor accident in history Before being abandoned about 48000 people lived in the city The city was founded in the 1970s when the nuclear power plant opened The site today is practically a museum showing the late Soviet era With entirely abandoned buildings including abandoned apartment buildings swimming pools and hospitals everything inside remains from records to papers to childrens toys and clothing Prypiat and the surrounding area will not be safe for people to live there for several centuries Scientists think that the most dangerous radioactive elements will take up to nine hundred years to decay sufficiently to render the area safe

The city is entirely accessible and is relatively safe on the road although it is unsafe to go around the city without a dosimeter The doors of all the buildings are open to reduce the risk to visitors although many have accumulated too much radioactive material to be safe to visit 

Thyroid cancer is cancer of the thyroid gland There are four forms papillary follicular medullary and anaplastic The most common forms are slow growing and may happen again but patients under 45 rarely die from it and the medullary form also has a good prognosis if it only grows in the thyroid gland and a poorer prognosis if it has spread the anaplastic form is fast growing and responds poorly to therapy

Thyroid nodules are diagnosed by ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration or frequently by thyroidectomy As the thyroid cancer can uptake iodine radioactive iodine is a commonly used modality in thyroid carcinomas However it is followed by TSH suppression by Thyroxine therapy

Containment building is a building with a nuclear reactor in it It is built around the reactor to keep the radiation from getting out if something happens to the reactor The containment building is the last barrier to the radiation getting into the environment Containment systems for nuclear power reactors are distinguished by size shape materials used and suppression systems The kind of containment used is determined by the type of reactor generation of the reactor and the specific plant needs

The Chernobyl accident was very bad partly because Soviet reactors had no containment buildings

The diagram shown to the right demonstrates the order of defense layers for a nuclear reactor The first layer of defense is the inert ceramic quality of the uranium oxide itself The second layer is the air tight zirkonium alloy of the fuel rod The third layer is the reactor pressure vessel made of steel more than a dozen centimeters thick The fourth layer is the pressure resistant air tight containment building The fifth layer is the exclusion zone around the reactor

Chernobyl is a city in northern Ukraine near the border with Belarus It was a major communications node and important centre of trade and commerce especially in the 19th century The city is located 145 kilometers south by south east of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant which became known for the Chernobyl accident The plant exploded on April 26 1986 clouds of radioactive particles were released and the severely damaged containment vessel started leaking radioactive matter More than 100000 people were evacuated from the city and other affected areas Despite the fact that radiation is still being emitted from the nuclear disaster site the 800 year old city of Chernobyl survives As of 2004 government workers still police the zoneThey try to clean up radioactive material Hundreds of people mostly the elderly have decided to live with the dangers and have returned to their homes in the zones towns and villages Their population was highest in 1987 when there were more than 1200 people In 2003 there were about 300

The Sino Soviet Split happened when Chinas leader Mao Zedong did not want to be friends with the Soviet Union anymore

The Soviet leader Stalin wanted to help spread communism especially in China During the Chinese Civil War the Soviets gave weapons and supplies to the Kuomintang because they were supposed to win but once the Communists were going to win for sure Stalin and the Soviet Union decided to help them This is one of the main reasons for the Sino Soviet Split since the Soviets didnt help Mao and the Communists from the start

Suddenly in 1953 Stalin died Mao saw and acted Stalin as the leader of Communism but also had a negative relationship with the Soviet Union throughout his time as leader Now that Stalin was gone he wanted to be leader He always wanted to be just like Stalin so now he wanted to be the leader of Communism The new Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was not like Stalin He did not want capitalism to collapse like Stalin did and he did not really care Mao got angry about this and he wanted Nikita Khrushchev to help him crush the imperialists Khrushchev said no and then Mao decided that if Khrushchev was not going to play his way they would not play at all Mao got so mad at Khrushchev he even tried to invade the Soviet Union The Chinese army was neglected and undertrained by Mao who did not really care much about the welfare of his army The Peoples Liberation Army was stopped at the border and the Soviets gave him one last chance to surrender or face invasion Mao somehow came to his senses and agreed to stop attacking the Soviet Union

There was peace between the USSR and China but they were suspicious of each other They were no longer friends Maos supporters said that it had been a victory

Liu Bei was the founder of the Chinese Shu Han dynasty and its first emperor

He went into battle against the Yellow Scarves rebellion in 184 along with his sworn brothers Guan Yu and Zhang Fei Later he joined Gongsun Zan against the evil Dong Zhuo who had seized the Han emperor Xian After Dong lost the emperor was in the clutches of his followers  until Cao Cao saved him and seized control over him Cao Cao tried to conquer all  of China for the emperor but in fact wanted to conquer it for himself He defeated Liu Bei once at the Battle of Changban in 207 but was not able to win the Battle of Red Cliffs against the united forces of Liu Bei and Sun Quan a warlord in the South

Sun Quan granted Liu Bei some land in the West of his domain and the two agreed to fight Cao Cao again if necessary

From 211 to 214 Liu Bei conquered the country Ba Shu in the West Because he had now an empire of his own Sun Quan demanded his western regions back but Liu Bei declined This made Sun Quan quite angry

After several useless battles against Liu Beis general Guan Yu Cao Cao chose to ally with Sun Quan They attacked Guan Yu with their allied forces and overthrew him in 219 Liu Bei was mad and swore revenge for the death of his brother and the loss of an important part of his empire

When Cao Cao died in 220 his son Cao Pi forced Emperor Xian of Han to abdicate Cao Pi declared himself Emperor of the Wei Dynasty Liu Bei found that offensive for he was a member of the royal family of Han and considered himself the righteous Emperor of China Thats why he declared himself emperor of the Shu Han in 221 The next year Sun Quan claimed the title Emperor of Wu for himself

Cao Cao was a Chinese general He managed to control the last Han Emperor Xian and conquered the whole northern China

Cao Cao gathered an army in 184 to fight against the Yellow Scarves rebellion After the Dong Zhuo had seized the Emperor Liu Bian in 189 and deposed him in favour of his brother Liu Xie a coalition of local warlords all over the country arose against Dong It was called by Cao Cao and led by Yuan Shao and many powerful warriors joined it After Dong Zhuos death through the hands of his foster son L Bu Emperor Xian was controlled by Dongs associates He fled to Changan in 195 but almost starved to death Cao Cao saved him in 196 and brought him to his own place at Xuchang

With the emperor under his control Cao Cao managed to slay most of the minor warlords in Northern China and was even able to defeat L Bu and the powerful Yuan Shao at Guandu in 200 He tried to conquer the south too but Liu Bei and Sun Quan opposed him and defeated his forces in the Battle at Red Cliffs Cao Cao led several campaigns against the south but with fairly low success Also he managed to get the famous general Guan Yu killed by Sun Quans general L Meng

Cao Cao died in 220 and his son Cao Pi followed him in control of the emperor He eventually deposed him the same year and became Emperor Wen of Wei making his father posthumously Emperor Meng of Wei

Zhang Fei was a warrior in ancient China He fought along with his brothers Liu Bei and Guan Yu for the restoration of the Han Dynasty

In the battles against the Dong Zhuo Zhang fended off the enemy general L Bu and was greatly rewarded by his then ally Cao Cao When Cao Cao tried to crush Liu Beis folk in 207 Zhang Fei drew the whole enemy forces back by yelling really loud Some historians believe that the yell crushed the bridge in front of him some say that the leading general of Cao Caos army died of fear

Zhang Fei was later killed by his own officers because after the death of his brother Guan Yu he became a drunk

Dong Zhuo was a reckless general in ancient China He took control over the imperial court of Han in 189 He was later killed by his own foster son Lu Bu

Dong Zhuo had been a successful warrior and general since his youth Anyway he was defeated by Yellow Scarves rebels in 184 and demoted After the death of Emperor Ling the eunuchs kidnapped the young follower Liu Bian and his brother Liu Xie Dong Zhuo freed them and intimidated the kidnappers so they committed suicide by drowning in the Yellow River Dong then brought the emperor and his brother back to the capital Luoyang and seized perfect control over the court Because Liu Bian seemed too stupid to him Dong deposed him and made his brother Liu Xie emperor instead In 190 he poisoned Liu Bian

Dong Zhuo became arrogant and violent He even forced the emperor to move to the city Changan as capital instead and burned Luoyang Because of that many warlords and Han generals all over the country formed an alliance to destroy Dongs reign After some fierce battles L Bu knew that his position was lost and killed his foster father Dong in 192

Dongs associates Guo Si and Li Jue continued to control the emperor but they started struggles and the emperor escaped He was rescued by Cao Cao in 196

Sun Quan was an ancient Chinese warlord and founder of Eastern Wu in 222

His brother Sun Ce conquered Southeastern China from 197 until his death in 200 Sun Quan was in charge at the age of 18 He continued to expand his empire and drew back the forces of Cao Cao in the Battle at Red Cliffs To have better opportunities against the north he gave his Jing Province to Liu Bei so that he could create an empire on his own Liu Bei conquered the other western territories from 211 to 214 and set his brother Guan Yu in charge of defending Jing

Now that Liu Bei had his own empire Sun quan demanded his western province back from him but Liu Bei declined In alliance with Cao Cao Sun Quans general L Meng captured Guan Yu in 219 and slayed him along with his son Guan Ping

After Cao Caos son Cao Pi started the Wei Dynasty in 220 Liu Bei also wanted to be an emperor and declared himself Emperor of Shu Han in 221 He considered himself the righteous heir of the abdicated Han emperor Xian Sun Quan declared himself King of Wu in 222 Liu Bei found that offensive and launched a great attack against Sun Quan but failed  due to Lu Xuns great tactics He died a year later

In Christianity Mary was the mother of Jesus Her story is told in the New Testament of the Bible 

Christian beliefs about Mary are based on the Bible In the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke it says that Mary was a young woman who was engaged to be married to a man called Joseph The Gospel of Luke says that an angel came to Mary to tell her that she would give birth to a Son and she should call him Jesus and that he would save people from their sins

Mary said How can this happen I am a virgin The angel said With God anything can happen

When Joseph found out that Mary was pregnant he thought about what he should do If he married her he would be unclean He decided to privately break the engagement But then he had a dream An angel told him that the baby was the Son of God 

At this time the Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus made a law that everyone in the Roman Empire must pay tax Everyone had to go back to the town that their family came from to have their name put on the tax lists Joseph came from Bethlehem which was called The City of David Joseph took Mary to Bethlehem and she gave birth to the baby Jesus in an animal shed because there was no room for them 

The Bible tells that thirty three years later Jesus was killed by crucifixion Although many of Jesus friends were frightened and ran away Mary stood by the cross and was with Jesus when he died As he was dying he asked a young disciple to care for Mary as if she was his own Mother and the disciple took her back to his home On the third day as it says in the Bible Mary went with other women to the grave where Jesus had been laid to wash his body with oil An angel told the women that Jesus was not there The angel said He is risen

Mary is so important they even wrote a prayer for her It is very amazing how much this beautiful mother did many interesting things

Mary is given honor in the Christian faith particularly in the Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran Church as the Mother of God and Eastern Orthodox Church as God bearer Mary is also given honour by Muslims because the Quran says that she was a virgin when she gave birth to her son Jesus who is given honour by Muslims as a great prophet 

Mary is often called by Roman Catholics and Lutherans the Blessed Virgin Mary There are many feast days which honour the Virgin Mary such as the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin on 8 September which remembers her birth

The Virgin Mary is often shown in Christian art Many paintings show Mary with the baby Jesus These paintings are known as Madonna and Child pictures 

Mary is often honored with the words Hail Mary you are full of Gods Grace The Lord is with you Blessed are you above other women and blessed is the child from your womb Jesus

Protestants believe Roman Catholics give Mary too much honor

The term Russian Revolution refers mostly to the Russian Revolution of 1917 which included the February Revolution that made Czar Nicholas II step down and the later Bolshevik revolt of Communism the October Revolution that had the royal family shot and killed

During the 1890s improvements in Russian industry put more jobs in cities This made the cities larger as people moved there The workers in the cities began to create political parties in order to try and change the horrible conditions that they lived and worked in Poor people from other parts of the Russian Empire like Poland and the Ukraine also created their own parties to try and stop the Russians oppressing them

In 1905 Russia lost a war with Japan This added to the peoples anger and after a peaceful protest of workers was shot at by the Emperors guards a rebellion began It did not really change anything but it meant that Nicholas promised to create an elected Parliament or Duma

The Duma was elected for the first time in March 1906 However there were both left wing and right wing opponents to it including socialists and people who were very loyal to the Emperor There were also arguments over whether or not to take power from the Emperor and give it to more ordinary people Nicholas eventually stopped the Duma three times and because that meant they could not say anything against Nicholas people became angry

In 1914 Russia joined World War I At first people thought this was a good decision and the country was united by patriotism But there were huge problems with supplies and by 1915 many soldiers were being sent to fight without any guns Communication was bad and Army officers argued a lot which meant that they did not make plans well The soldiers became unhappy and over 3000000 Russians died

In 1915 the Emperor took personal control of the Russian Army and moved to the Army headquarters This was a mistake Not only did he not improve the situation he began to be blamed for it The fact that he was not near the government also meant that his wife Queen Alexandra was left in charge Whenever the Duma tried to warn him that the people were angry she would say they were lying so he would ignore them He even ignored a report by his secret police the Okhrana which said that a revolution might happen if things did not get better for ordinary people

The first revolution began with a series of strikes in early February 1917 People in food queues in St Petersburg the capital of Russia began a demonstration They were joined by thousands of women who left the fabric factories where they worked The strike spread through the capital and by February 25th most of St Petersburgs factories had had to close

On the evening of the 25th Nicholas II sent the chief of the army in St Petersburg a telegram telling him to use his soldiers to stop the strikes The army chief did that but the soldiers joined the workers instead of stopping them The police also joined them and the governments power collapsed

On March 13th Nicholas abdicated and control of Russia was given to a Provisional Government

After the February Revolution the Provisional Government was challenged by a large group of workers in St Petersburg the Petrograd Soviet While the Governments leader Alexander Kerensky tried to improve things by allowing freedom of speech and letting political prisoners go there was growing discontent The lack of food became worse wages went down and the national debt grew to 10 million roubles

Vladimir Lenin arrived in St Petersburg in April 1917 He was a Communist and had been exiled to Switzerland by the Emperor but the Provisional Government had allowed him to come back He began to lead a Communist group called the Bolsheviks

In July the Bolsheviks spent four days demonstrating against the Government The military attacked them and Lenin was forced to escape to Finland until August when the Bolsheviks were asked to help defend the government against a takeover by the army The result of this was that their reputation improved and they were given weapons by the Government

The Provisional Governments reputation kept getting worse as time went on while the Bolsheviks reputation got better because they refused to work with them again

On October 10th the Bolsheviks Central Committee voted to start a revolution One began in Estonia on October 23rd and another started in St Petersburg two days later This time the revolution was mostly peaceful and the Bolsheviks Red Army took over many government buildings without a fight only two people were killed in total It ended with the takeover of the Emperors old Winter Palace on the morning of the 26th when the Provisional Government was arrested

The Soviets took power and formed a Congress which began on the 25th October Some members who were not Bolsheviks walked out during its first few meetings but this made little difference to its decisions The people who left were even taunted by Leon Trotsky on their way out he told them to go where you belong the dustbin of history All parties who opposed the Bolsheviks were eventually broken up and their leaders were arrested

The Congress then began to get rid of private property This meant that all land and money was to be owned by the people and control of factories was given to their workers

Several countries that had been in the Russian Empire before the Revolution such as Estonia and the Ukraine had been asking for independence since February As the new government formed they declared independence and were allowed it

In Russia the revolution was severely challenged by countries that were not Communist and the invading White Armies In July 1918 countries such as America the United Kingdom and France sent more than 15 armies to fight the Bolsheviks The ex Emperor and his family were shot to stop them from being freed by the White Armies and in order to win the war Lenin began a scheme to divert food and supplies to the Communist Army The plan worked and the Bolsheviks won the war but the lack of food meant that between 3 and 10 million people died of hunger

Some European countries recognised the Soviet Union as a proper country in the early 1920s while America refused to until 1933

The term Red October has also been used to describe the events of the month

The term Russian Revolution can also mean the Russian Revolution of 1905

When talking about time if the comment does not say the year the term usually refers to the October Revolution of 1917 If someone is talking about the 1905 Revolution they will say the year and if its the February Revolution they will say the month

The Third Russian Revolution was an Anarchist revolution against the Bolsheviks and the White Army that lasted from 1918 to 1922

Baguettes are long thin loaves of bread popular in France and other French speaking countries Baguettes are common in Europe Usually they are made of white bread Baguettes usually have a hard crust on the outside but soft white bread on the inside

French traditions say that bread may only contain the following four things flour water yeast and salt Anything containing more than those things must not be called bread

A baguette is about 5 6 cm wide 3 to 4 cm high and about 65 cm long Such a baguette usually weighs about 250 grams It is common to dip the bread into olive oil when it is eaten 

The baguette is thought as to have come from France but it actually came from Vienna In the middle of the nineteenth century steam ovens had just been brought into use This allowed loaves to be made with a crispy crust and the white centre similar to todays baguettes But at that time in 1920 a law was passed that did not let bakers work before 4am This made it impossible to make the loaf in time for their customers breakfasts The longer thinner baguette helped solve this problem because it could be prepared and baked much faster

Outside France the baguette is also called a french stick It is a loaf of bread up to a metre long but only about four to five centimetres in diameter The baguette is a symbol of France

Baguettes are eaten as a sandwich cut in half They are also eaten for breakfast

A loaf the same length as a baguette but thicker is known as pain A thin version of the baguette is called ficelle In restaurants the thick one is more served than the other kind

Even within France there is a difference between a traditional baguette and a supermarket baguette

Barometer is an instrument used to measure air pressure The barometer measures air pressure in units called hectopascals Air pressure and differences in pressure are important ways to describe or measure weather Therefore the barometer is important for meteorologists 

There are various types of barometers such as the water barometer aneroid barometer and the mercury barometer They were created by an Italian mathematician named Evangelista Torricelli in 1643 They were also used for measuring altitude or height above the ground such as the height of a mountain and they were often used to measure altitude aboard a hot air balloon They were also used by miners in caves to determine the depth of a mine The most used purpose of the barometer was measuring air pressure The barometer is a good tool for predicting weather

Research is the process of finding facts These facts will lead to knowledge Research is done by using what is already known Additional knowledge can be obtained by proving existing theories and by trying to better explain observations Research process both analytical and experimental should be systematic organized and objective

Students do research by participating in the field or laboratory experiments reading relevant books or internet information about a subject taking notes and making conclusions 

The Scientific method is a common way of doing this kind of research which is meant to improve understanding of Biology Engineering Physics Chemistry and of many other fields As a result scientific research makes possible to discover new medicines to build automobiles safer and to provide healthy food Money for research comes from governments private corporations and charities

An antigen is a protein expressed by a bacteria or virus that is recognized by the immune system as foreign which can stimulate the production of antibodies and combine specifically with them 

Usually an antibody is a molecule perhaps on the cell surface of a bacterium or virus

Antibodies are always foreign except in rare cases the system is tolerant of its own molecules Autoimmune diseases are caused when this safeguard fails

When an antigen is introduced into the body it causes the production of antibodies Antigens include bacteria cells of transplanted organs plant pollen and toxins 

Antigens stimulate the production of antibodies they do not produce them directly

The first time that a new antigen comes into contact with the body the response of the immune system will be a complete immune response During this first response the antigen will cause antibodies to be made 

The next time the same antigen contacts the body a full scale immune response is not needed as the body already has a specific antibody available instantly for that antigen

Information Entropy is a concept from information theory It tells how much information there is in an event In general the more uncertain or random the event is the more information it will contain The concept of information entropy was created by a mathematician He was named Claude Elwood Shannon

Lets look at an example If someone is told something they already know the information they get is very small It will be pointless for them to be told something they already know This information would have very low entropy

If they were told about something they knew little about they would get much new information This information would be very valuable to them They would learn something This information would have high entropy

Traffic cones are cone shaped markers generally made out of plastic that are placed on roads to temporarily redirect automobile traffic in a safe manner 

Traffic cones are often placed around construction sites or roadside accidents As well many utility companies such as telephone companies and electric companies place cones on the road when utility workers are working on or near the road Cones are also used by driving schools to set up tests of turning and parking skills They have many other uses including bike training fun and for personal use like reserving parking spaces

Traffic cones are easily movable and about 60 cm tall Traffic cones come in many different colors with orange yellow and red being the most common colors Many types of traffic cones have reflective strips or stripes of reflective paint so that the cones are easier to see at night

Traffic cones were invented in 1914 by Charles P Rudabaker The first cones were made of concrete In the 2000s most cones are made of brightly colored plastic

The Great Barrier Reef is the worlds largest coral reef It is close to the coast of Queensland Australia It is 2300 km long It is made up of nearly 3000 coral reefs and over 600 islands It has been listed an important World Heritage Site by UNESCO The Great Barrier Reef is the largest structure made by living things It can be seen from outer space

James Cook discovered the reef by accident on 11 June 1770 when his ship the Endeavour crashed into it The coral ripped a large hole in the bottom of his ship Cook and the crew were able to keep the ship from sinking They were able to get the ship onto a beach at what is now called Cooktown His crew took seven weeks to repair the ship and continue the voyage

The Reef Research Centre has found the remains of coral that are half a million years old Corals have been growing in the region for as long as 25 million years The corals have not always formed coral reefs

It is difficult to work out the age of the Great Barrier Reef This is because of the way a reef can grow and shrink as the sea level changes A coral reef can grow in diameter that is how wide they are from 1 to 2 cm per year They can also grow upwards from 1 to 15 cm per year Coral can not grow if the water is too deep because it needs light from the sun They cannot grow out of the water

The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and Australian Institute of Marine Science say the current living reef started growing about 20000 years ago It started to grow on an older reef This makes the beginning of the reef during the Last Glacial Maximum At that time the sea level was 120 metres lower than it is today The land that forms the bottom of the Great Barrier Reef was a coastal plain The plain had some large hills Some of these hills were parts of older reefs

From 20000 years ago until 6000 years the sea level began to rise As it rose the corals could grow higher on the hills of the coastal plain By 13000 years ago the sea level was 60 metres lower than the present day Corals began to grow around the hills of the coastal plain These became continental islands As the sea level rose higher most of these continental islands were covered by water The corals could then grow over the hills This formed the present cays and reefs Sea level on the Great Barrier Reef has not risen much in the last 6000 years The CRC Reef Research Centre has worked out that the present living reef is 6000 to 8000 years old

The remains of a very old barrier reef has been found in the Kimberley area This is in the northern part of Western Australia

The Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area has been divided into 70 different areas These are called bioregions Each bioregion has its own special plants and animals There are 30 reef bioregions and 40 are non reef bioregions In the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef there are ribbon reefs and deltaic reefs These kinds of reef do not exist in the rest of the Great Barrier Reef system

The Great Barrier Reef has 14000 different plants and animals This includes many vulnerable or endangered species Some of these exist only on this reef system

Thirty species of whales dolphins and porpoises have been seen in the Great Barrier Reef This includes the dwarf minke whale Indo Pacific humpback dolphin and the humpback whale Most of the population of the dugongs live there

Six species of sea turtles come to the reef to breed These are the green sea turtle leatherback sea turtle hawksbill turtle loggerhead sea turtle flatback turtle and the olive ridley There are two different groups of green sea turtles on the Great Barrier Reef One group lives in the northern part of the reef and the other in the south Fifteen species of seagrass attract the dugongs and turtles They also provide a food and shelter for fish The most common kinds of seagrasses are Halophila and Halodule

Saltwater Crocodiles live in mangrove and salt marshes on the coast near the reef No crocodile nests have been found on the reef The salt water crocodiles on the reef travel long distances There are not many living around the reef Around 125 species of shark stingray skates or chimera live on the reef About 5000 species of mollusc live on the reef These include the giant clam nudibranchs and cone snails Forty nine species of pipefish and nine species of seahorse have been found Seven species of frogs live on the islands

215 species of birds come to the reef or nest or roost on the islands This includes 22 species of seabirds and 32 species of shorebirds These include the white bellied sea eagle and roseate tern Most nesting sites are on islands in the northern and southern regions of the Great Barrier Reef About 17 million birds use the sites to breed

The islands of the Great Barrier Reef also have 2195 known plant species Three of these do not live anywhere else The northern islands have 300 350 plants which are woody The southern islands have 200 plants which are herbaceous The Whitsunday region has the most plant speciess The plant species are spread by birds

Seventeen types of sea snake live on the Great Barrier Reef They take about 4 years to become old enough to breed They usually live on the sea floor They live in warm waters up to m to ft50spellUKprecision0 deep They are more common in the southern part of the reef

More than 1500 species of fish live on the reef These include the clownfish red bass red throat emperor and several types of snapper and coral trout There are at least 330 species of sea squirts on the reef These vary in size from 1 mm 10 cm in diameter Between 300 500 species of bryozoans live on the reef system These are small water animals that look like moss or branches

Four hundred species of corals both hard corals and soft corals live on the reef Most of these spawn releasing thousands of eggs in huge events This spawning is controlled by the rising sea temperatures This happens in spring summer and some parts of autumn as part of the moons lunar cycle and the daynight diurnal cycle Reefs in the inner Great Barrier Reef spawn during the week after the full moon in October Outer reefs spawn in November and December The common soft corals on the Great Barrier Reef belong to 36 different types Five hundred species of marine algae or seaweed live on the reef This includes thirteen types of Halimeda These deposit chalky mounds up to 100 metres wide They have mini ecosystems on their surface which have been compared to rainforest cover 

A new report the Reef Outlook Report says that climate change will cause huge damage to the reef The report was written by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority Warmer and more acidic water around the coral reef will slow down calcification which is how the coral grows and becomes strong The corals will become bleached and many species that live on and around the reef will be in danger The Australian government has already spent AU325 million to improve the health of the reef in the last two years

The Reef Outlook Report also warned of other dangers to the reef These included poor quality water running into the sea from the mainland This water is polluted with farm insecticides and rubbish from nearby towns The increasing amount of development on the coast is destroying natural marine and coastal habitats There is also some damage from fishing

The Missouri Compromise was an agreement passed in 1820 between the pro slavery and anti slavery factions in the United States Congress involving primarily the regulation of slavery in the western territories It prohibited slavery in the former Louisiana Territory north of the parallel 3630 north except within the boundaries of the proposed state of Missouri Prior to the agreement the House of Representatives had refused to accept this compromise and a conference committee was appointed The United States Senate refused to concur in the amendmentclarification needed and the whole measure was lost

During the following session the House passed a similar bill with an amendment introduced on January 26 1820 by John W Taylor of New York allowing Missouri into the union as a slave state The question had been complicated by the admission in December of Alabama a slave state making the number of slave and free states equal In addition there was a bill in passage through the House to admit Maine as a free state

The Senate decided to connect the two measures It passed a bill for the admission of Maine with an amendment enabling the people of Missouri to form a state constitution Before the bill was returned to the House a second amendment was adopted on the motion of Jesse B Thomas of Illinois excluding slavery from the Missouri Territory north of the parallel 3630 north except within the limits of the proposed state of Missouri

A peafowl is a bird of the Phasianidae family It is a relative of the pheasant 

There are two species of Peafowl the Asiatic peafowl or the Congo Peafowl The Congo peafowl is the only member of the pheasant family that originated outside Asia 

The male Peafowl can have up to 150 brightly coloured feathers on its tail coverts 

For centuries Peafowls have been admired for their beauty and hunted for their meat Recently Peacocks have become more popular in parks and gardens

The male peafowls have long colourful feathers Female peafowls have shorter brown feathers

They like to eat any kind of green shoots as well as wheat cracked corn or wild game feed They can handle freezing temperatures as long as they have a dry perch that is out of the wind and weather Dry dog and cat chows make excellent winter feed for peafowl who are omnivores eating insects small snakes lizards grain as well as many varieties of greens They are particularly fond of petunias and similar pot plants leaving nothing but a small green circle where the stem once emerged from the soil The birds will learn to come to a specific place at specific times of day to be fed and a regular light feeding during summer adapts them to coming to the feeding place in winter

The peafowl is native to southeast Asia including India but they were brought to Europe long ago They can acclimatize to colder areas 

The very long elegant and colorful plumage of the male birds peacocks is grown over the winter months so that they are ready for the early spring mating season during which each male establishes a territory and calls the females to come admire his dance a rustling of tail quills which hold up the fanned back plumes as he stamps and turns The summoning call is loud repeated happens sometimes at night and sounds to some people like a woman screaming Often it is tri syllabic mi fa sol Once the mating season is over the tail feathers are naturally shed

The peacocks display is a classic example of sexual selection

The female birds peahens are soft brown and gray with white chests and bellies and some light green on the neck the colors blending so well with weeds and grasses that when the female is nesting on the ground she is almost invisible

The hen teaches her chicks what to eat by putting her beak point down at a chosen bug grain seed or leaf and making a throaty grock sound The chick put its beak against the mothers follows the beak to the tip and eats whatever it points at The chicks can learn what to eat from a hen of another species but unlike baby chickens peachicks need to be shown what to eat Chicks hatched in a hatchery can starve to death if there is no hen to teach them what to eat

In addition to the eat this sound the female has a particular call for a missing chick a where are you hoo hah call two toned high then low mi do mi do When a chick is missing this call can go on for hours

She lays from two to six eggs in the spring time and once all are laid sits on the eggs for about thirty days to hatch them leaving the nest once or twice a day to feed and drink Often the female will utter a shrieked trouble call a quickly repeated cuk cuk cuk cuk when she leaves the nest to attract predators away from it

Once the chicks are hatched the mother leads them away from the broken eggs as the smell of the eggs attracts predators They are able to flutter a little within hours and in a few days can fly up into sheltering trees by going first to lower branches and working their way higher preferring high protected branches The chicks roost on either side of the peahen and she extends her wings to cover them during the night thus protecting them from rain hail and visits from owls They begin to grow their crowns when they are only a few weeks old and it takes about a year for them to reach full size though it may take three years to reach breeding age Both males and females are hatched with the same plumage nine to twelve months after hatching the males necks begin to turn peacock blue and their splendid plumage takes about four years to reach full size

The dachshund is a breed of dog It is usually short but long from front to back and with short legs Dachshund is a German word that is used in English and it means badger dog

The breed was developed to use its sense of smell to find chase and hunt badgers and other animals that live in holes A dachshund has a long narrow body so it is sometimes called a wiener dog hot dog or sausage dog Some people believe that using those words does not show respect

Today dachshunds have crooked legs loose skin and a barrel like chest Over time breeders selected dogs so that those features would appear in puppies That way dachshunds could do a better job of burrowing into tight spaces Another feature is a long tail

The coat or fur of a dachshund comes in three kinds smooth or short haired long haired and wire haired The wire haired dachshund usually is shorter front to back than the other two 

A fully grown dachshund weighs between 16 and 28 lb while the miniature dachshund may weigh less than 11 lb The writer H L Mencken said that A dachshund is a half dog high and a dog and a half long

Dachshund fur comes in many colours The colors that are most common are red and black and tan There are solid black and solid chocolate brown dachshunds Many people think those dachshunds are handsome but the colors are not standard or official that is you cannot enter those dogs in some dog shows

Dachshunds are playful fun dogs People know that dachshunds like to chase small animals and birds and when they chase those animals they do it ferociously Many dachshunds are strong headed or stubborn and that means they can be hard to train Dachshunds are often very loyal to their owners In fact they can be much more loyal than other kinds of dogs But wire haired dachshunds often do not show that kind of loyalty to their owners

People know that dachshunds have deep and tender eyes and that dachshunds have many facial expressions

Dachshunds often have spinal problems that is their backbone can become injured That is because of the dogs very long spinal column and short rib cage The problems are usually hereditary that is they are passed down from parent dogs to puppies

A dachshund that is obese can have a higher risk of getting injured That is because the extra weight puts more strain on the backbone To prevent injury dachshunds should not climb stairs or jump unless they really have to It is also important to hold the dog the right way by holding up the front and the rear parts of the body at all times

Some people have wondered if dachshunds go back to ancient Egypt People have found drawings and engravings from ancient Egypt that show hunting dogs with short legs But the dachshund of today was bred in Europe and it has parts of German French and English hounds and terriers

Kings and queens all over Europe have had dachshunds Queen Victoria especially liked dachshunds

Poverty means not having enough money for basic needs such as food water shelter or toilets Many people in different countries live in poverty especially in developing areas of Africa Latin America and some parts Asia

There are different ways to measure poverty The World Bank says that extreme poverty is when someone has less than US1 a day to live on It has been changed to rule out certain effects such as inflation meaning that prices of things rise higher than what a person is paid and other price level differences Moderate poverty is when people have to live on less than 2 a day In the year 2001 11 billion people were seen as extremely poor and 27 billion were seen as moderately poor 

In the developed world this does not apply There many people are seen as the working poor They have a job but do not earn enough money for basic things such as food and a home In most developed countries people without jobs receive money from the government but this is often less than they need for a comfortable life 

There are different ways to tell if a country is rich or poor The Gross Domestic Product or GDP and Human Development Index or HDI are two of those measures Gross Domestic Product is the money made from trade from inside the country 

HDI meaning the Human Development Index is a different matter It is determined by life expectancy and adult literacy rates Places in Africa like Guinea Bissau and Sierra Leone are the poorest with Sierra Leone having the lowest HDI ranking in the world

Poverty is a hurdle in the way of a countrys progress One way of helping lower poverty is by educating poor people so that they can start contributing to a nations economic development Education teaches the poor about their rights and may show them the path to become an important part in growth and expansion of the country

One of the most important things that is needed to make a country richer is for the Government to want to help poor people do better Without this it is hard for people to become better off

The British Empire was a global power that contained territories owned by the United Kingdom The empire was the largest empire in history and at its peak controlled 23 of the worlds surface More than 458 million people were brought under the control of the British Empire It was known as the largest colonial empire in history Today most of its members are in the Commonwealth of Nations The most famous part of the British Empire was the East India Trading Company which started out as a small business before becoming a very large trading company which many people depended on

In 1588 the forces of Elizabeth I defeated the Spanish Armada the most powerful navy in the world and began its way to an ultimate global empire In the 17th century it started making colonies in North America and India leading to its conflicts and total victory over its rivals after Spains defeat The Netherlands and France After the Anglo Dutch War and Seven Years War Britain occupied almost all the Dutch and French territories in the New World and Asia Although the American colonies gained independence in 1776 it didnt seem to influence the empire By 1919 after Britains victory in World War I it came to its most prosperous period People in the 19th century says the sun never sets on the British Empire But after World War II its global empire collapsed 

The British Empire was seen as a role model for other nations most notably Germany Germany had a bad habit of starting wars in Europe in part because they wanted an Empire like the one that Britain had established The people of the UK and Germany are like cousins and Germany wanted to be successful like Britain 

The British Empire began to decline after World War II when Britain decided to give back colonies known as Decolonization Britain decided to give back nations because her work was done The British had taken all the available resources from each country the spread of Christianity was complete and the English language was all over the world Also many of the persons the Empire had ruled over wanted to be in charge of their own country rather than being led by the British from London 

One of the last parts of the British Empire that was alive was Hong Kong which was given back to China in 1997 Britain retained its title as a Superpower in 1982 with the Falklands War a War against Argentina over the possession of the Falkland Islands 

There are currently 14 remaining overseas territories under UK sovereignty

Scott Joplin was a well known ragtime musician and composer Joplin was born in the US state of Texas sometime between June 1867 and January 1868 and died in 1917 Though he was from Texas most of his pieces were written when he was in Missouri and New York City

Joplin is most well known for writing piano pieces called rags His music became popular again in the 1970s with the album Scott Joplin Piano Rags performed by Joshua Rifkin from Nonesuch Records He may be most commonly known now by the Marvin Hamlisch adaptation of his composition The Entertainer which was used in the 1973 movie The Sting starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford His best known song while he was alive was Maple Leaf Rag Other rags he wrote were The Ragtime Dance and Magnetic Rag Scott Joplin wrote more than 40 piano rags but he also wrote two operas A Guest of Honor and Treemonisha A Guest of Honor was performed in Joplins lifetime but since then the music has been lost Treemonisha was never performed while Joplin was alive but it has been performed since then Joplin also wrote a symphony but the music has been lost

The flag of Japan shows a red sun in the middle of a white field It is called Nisshoki formally in Japan But Japanese people usually call it Hinomaru which means circle of the sun The Japanese navy uses the other flag the sun has rays This flag represents the heat of the sun

Originally nationalism was found together with socialism Many early socialists were also nationalists Especially the earliest forms of nationalism had lots of socialist features Many people who thought that ethnic group should not be oppressed by other ethnic groups thought also that normal folk the backbone of society like workers and peasants should not be oppressed by higher social classes like rich people They thought that it is wrong for somebody to live in great welfare that is made by hard work or even oppression of others All the social classes should work together and have a common goals that aims for good of everyone These goals can be called national interest National interest is ideal and not always easy to find There are different ways to reach national interest for example politics

Nationalists started to support and admire the normal folk especially peasants who were seen uncorrupted gallant and fair  unlike high classes For example normal folk often had more original and local ethnic culture than high classes whose culture was seen more rootless National Romanticism was based much on the ideal of uncorrupt folk

Socialism and nationalism grew together but they have also been put to oppose each other in some cases The most known opposition between these ideologies was in Soviet Union The Soviet propaganda made nationalism an insult word that was linked with opposed ideologies like capitalism liberalism imperialism or fascism Still even in Soviet Union and other communist or socialist countries there were lots of nationalism The most capitalist countries like United States were rather patriotic than nationalist The Nordic countries which were amongst the most pure nation states were not very capitalist or rightist they were built on social democratic way that is at left side Only after Nordic countries became more multicultural their politics became more rightist 

Today nationalism does not have a common stand on those fields of politics that are outside of its basic goals like left right politics However nationalism can be a part of bigger political ideology or agenda that can be leftist or rightist or something outside that classification

Nationalism is still usually connected to goals that resist strong hierarchy between social classes inside society Nationalist people are usually more or less against the strongest forms of capitalism which they think gives too much power of rich people and big companies

Nationalism is the opposite of imperialism Imperialism tries to make big nations that have many ethnic groups In imperialist states some groups are usually more powerful and are seen as better than others Nationalists think that such hierarchy is bad They say that in nations with one ethnic group everyone has the same value and power Sometimes nationalism is used to support imperialism but that is against the original idea of nationalism Such using of political ideas against their original purpose is quite usual in politics and happens with many other ideas too

Nationalism had important role in ending the colonial rule Nationalism spread to colonies and made their people to desire independence Nationalism also made the people in metropolitan states to accept more the desire of other people to rule themselves However nationalists think that the end of colonialization of Africa was not done well They think that there would not be so many conflicts in Africa if African nations had built in a nationalist way After the imperialists left their African colonies the new nations were built with borders that were not the same as the ethnic borders New nations became nations with many ethnic groups which do not want to or cannot live peacefully in the same society with the others

Drought is when an area gets less than its normal amount rain over months or even years Crops and other plants need water to grow and land animals need it to live It can become dangerous to people causing famine and even creating deserts Drought is a natural event caused by other weather events like El Nino and high pressure systems Drought can also be triggered by people cutting down forests by global warming and by diverting rivers or emptying lakes

Deafness is when someone cannot hear or cannot hear well There were many famous people who were deaf such as Ludwig van Beethoven and Helen Keller Deafness is also known as hearing loss

A person is considered to be deaf if they cannot hear the same range of sounds as a person with normal hearing ability People that cannot hear any sounds are also deaf People who are partially deaf may hear some sounds and may hear words

There are different causes of deafness

Many people in Liverpool are proud of their city and of the Liver birds There is a story that the birds will come alive if a truly pure woman walks between them This will never happen This is an example of the humor of the local people

A demonstration can mean an event where people do something to let others know what they think and to try to change peoples point of view A demonstration is usually considered more successful the more people participate

Examples of this type of demonstration include marches and rallies

In 2003 many people demonstrated against the 2003 Invasion of Iraq

A demonstration can also mean when someone shows how to do something or in what ways a thing can be used Salespeople often demonstrate things like computers cars and televisions to customers so they can make sure the customer sees all the features of the item Demo is short for demonstration and people often use it to describe this meaning of the word

Monounsaturated fats are found in food items more particularly natural foods like nuts and avocados They are the main component in olive oil 

In general these fats are considered to be healthier as compared to the others They have the same amount of energy but they reduce blood cholesterol levels This reduces the risk to the heart

Polyunsaturated fats are fats that are usually found in items like vegetable oils Such items are typically found to be liquid at room temperature 

Polyunsaturated fats are called as organic compounds Its molecules contains more than one double bonds The peculiar structure reduces the strength of the forces between molecules This causes the items to have a lower melting point This is why the items are usually liquid at room temperature

The North Avenue Irregulars is a 1979 movie starring Edward Hermann

The movie is about a newly installed minister who entrusts despite objections by the founding pastors daughter the churches sinking fund money into the hands of a congregate whom he does not even know with instructions to increase the amount in the fund 

The money is bet on a horse race and upon hearing this the Pastor gives the shortest sermon in history and begins a pursuit of the money and the organized crime syndicate amid the hijinx of assorted feminine members of the congregation in a pursuit of the money trail

Hikaru Utada is an American born Japanese singer and songwriter Because she was born in the United States she can speak English perfectly She is the only child of the 1970s Enka singer Keiko Fuji Her first Japanese album First Love was very popular It sold more copies than any other Japanese singer ever She is also known in the west for singing the theme songs for Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II Simple and Clean and Sanctuary

When Hikaru was little she did not want to become a singer She saw how busy her mother and fathers lives were and did not want that for herself When she was 10 years old her parents asked her if she wanted to write songs She did not want to but tried doing it She wrote a song called Ill Be Stronger During this time Hikaru went to school in New York Her classmates were not able to say her name right so they shortened it to Hikki Hikki became Hikarus nickname Her fans in Japan call her that The name is not promoted very much in the United States because it sounds too much like hickey

In 1996 Hikaru started to record an album when she was only 13 years old It was in English The album was in the RB style It was written all by herself The album was going to be released on the EMI record company but since the company fell apart it was never sold in the United States A man called Akira Miyake from Japan heard the album and wanted to release it there Hikaru agreed and the album was released in Japan in 1998

The album sold okay but it was not until later when Hikaru started to sing Japanese songs that she became famous Her music still sounded very RB but at this point it sounded more pop Her first single Automatic Time Will Tell reached 2 on the single charts in Japan A while later after another single she released her first Japanese album First Love This sold a very large amount and became the most sold album by a Japanese singer

Hikaru went on to release two more albums Distance and Deep River In each album her style changed slightly Each album was less RB and more Pop In 2004 she released an album made of all her old single songs She next released an album in English called Exodus Exodus was released under the record label Island Def Jam It was sold in Japan the United States and the United Kingdom She sung wrote and made the music for the whole album herself The album sold many copies in Japan but it did not sell that well in the United States However many famous people and music critics thought that the album was good

Hikaru has started to make new Japanese music again but continued on making all the music herself Usually a singersongwriter will only write the music and the lyrics but Hikaru decided she wanted to arrange her songs all by herself as well She released her new album Ultra Blue in mid 2006 Soon after she went on tour all across Japan This is the second time she has ever done this

The Scramble for Africa from the 1880s until the start of World War I was a time of much colonial expansion in Africa Many European countries started colonies in Africa during this time This is an example of New Imperialism

The last half of the 19th century saw a change in the way countries controlled their colonies They changed from economic control through mass settlement to political and military control of the colonys resources especially in the 1870 This was seen in the fight for the areas that were controlled by European nations 

Some famous people who helped European countries find more land in Africa included the explorers David Livingston Henry Morton Stanley and Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza and the French politician Jules Ferry

The Berlin Conference tried to end the fight between the United Kingdom Frances Third Republic and the German Empire At this conference they agreed that effective occupation would be the rule for colonial claims Laws were made for using direct rule on a colony backed up by military power

Seaweed is a term used for several forms of multicellular marine algae Red algae Green algae and Brown algae are commonly considered to be seaweed Seaweed gets its energy from photosynthesis Because it looks very different from other plants seaweed is usually not considered to be a plant

Two specific environmental requirements dominate seaweed ecology These are the presence of seawater and the presence of enough light for photosynthesis Often a firm attachment point is also needed 

For this reason seaweeds can be found in the littoral zone of the sea Within that zone they are more frequent on a rocky shore than on sand 

Another common requirement is a firm attachment point As a result seaweeds most commonly inhabit the littoral zone and within that zone more frequently on rocky shores than on sand or shingle Seaweeds occupy a wide range of ecological niches The highest elevation is only wetted by the tops of sea spray the lowest is several meters deep In some areas littoral seaweeds can extend several miles out to sea The limiting factor in such cases is sunlight availability The deepest living seaweeds are the various kelps

A number of species such as Sargassum have adapted to a fully planktonic niche and are free floating depending on gas filled sacs to maintain an acceptable depth

Others have adapted to live in tidal rock pools In this niche seaweeds must withstand rapidly changing temperature and salinity and even occasional drying

Seaweed has different uses Sometimes it is farmed or foraged from the wild

People living on the coast often eat seaweed especially those in East Asia such as Japan China Korea Taiwan Thailand and Vietnam It is also used in Belize Peru the Canadian Maritimes Scandinavia Ireland Wales Philippines and Scotland

Tiwi Albay residents discovered a new pancit or noodles made from seaweed These have health benefits Seaweed is rich in calcium and magnesium and seaweed noodles can be cooked into pancit canton pancit luglug spaghetti or carbonara

In Asia Zicai gim and nori are sheets of dried Porphyra used in soups or to wrap sushi Chondrus crispus is another red alga used in producing various food additives along with Kappaphycus and various gigartinoid seaweeds Porphyra is a red alga used in Wales to make laver Laverbread made from oats and the laver is a popular dish there Affectionately called Dulce in northern Belize seaweeds are mixed with milk nutmeg cinnamon and vanilla to make a common beverage

Seaweeds are also harvested or cultivated for the extraction of alginate agar and carrageenan gelatinous substances collectively known as hydrocolloids or phycocolloids Hydrocolloids have attained commercial significance as food additives The food industry exploits their gelling water retention emulsifying and other physical properties Agar is used in foods such as confectionery meat and poultry products desserts and beverages and moulded foods Carrageenan is used in salad dressings and sauces dietetic foods and as a preservative in meat and fish products dairy items and baked goods

Seaweed is a source of iodine necessary for thyroid function and to prevent goitre

Seaweed extract is used in some diet pills Other seaweed pills exploit the same effect as gastric banding expanding in the stomach to make the body feel more full

Seaweed is currently under consideration as a potential source of bioethanol Seaweed is an ingredient in some toothpaste cosmetics and paints

A Fairy tale is an English language expression for a kind of short story It has the same meaning as the French expression conte de fe the German word Mrchen the Italian fiaba the Polish ba or the Swedish saga These stories are not all directly about fairies but they are different from legends and traditions and directly moral stories There are usually fairies goblins elves trolls giants or gnomes in fairy tales and usually magic

Fairy tales can also mean unusual happiness Also fairy tale can simply mean any unbelievable story

Where demons and witches are seen as real fairy tales can sometimes be similar to legends where the story is claimed to be historically true However differently from legends and epics they usually do not specifically mention religion and actual places people and events They also do not say exactly when it happened Instead they say that the story happened once upon a time

Fairy tales are found in oral form and in literary form Fairy tales histories are hard to find This is because only written fairy tales can be passed on for a long time Still literary works show that there has been fairy tales for thousands of years Many fairy tales today have are based on very old stories that have appeared though in different ways in many different cultures around the world Fairy tales and works based on from fairy tales are still written today

At first fairy tales were for both adults and children but now children are mostly connected with fairy tales Examples of traditional old fairy tales are Sleeping Beauty Little Red Riding Hood and The Three Little Pigs There can also be new fairy tales written by an author like The Little Mermaid or Pinocchio New fairy tales were for example written by Hans Christian Andersen James Thurber and Oscar Wilde

People do not agree what a fairy tale exactly is Some argue that a story with fairies or other magical beings in the story would make it a fairy tale However others have suggested that the expression began when the French expression conte de fes was being translated Vladimir Propp criticized the difference between fairy tales and animal tales in his book Morphology of the Folktale He said that many stories had both fantastic qualities and animals He suggested that fairy tales could be recognized by their story but this has been criticized because the same stories can be found in stories that are not fairy tales

In fact people such as Stith Thompson point out that there are often more talking animals and magic in fairy tales than fairies However just because there is a talking animal in a story does not mean that the story is a fairy tale

Steven Swann Jones said that fairy tales were different from other sorts of folktales because of magic Davidson and Chaudri say that transformation is the most important part of a fairy tale

Some like to use the German expression Mrchen or wonder tale instead of fairy tale For example in his 1977 edition of The Folktale Thompson said that fairy tales were a tale of some length involving a succession of motifs or episodes It moves in an unreal world without definite locality or definite creatures and is filled with the marvelous In this never never land humble heroes kill adversaries succeed to kingdoms and marry princesses The characters and motifs of fairy tales are simple princesses and girls taking care of geese youngest sons and brave princes ogres giants dragons and trolls wicked stepmothers and false heroes fairy godmothers and other magic helpers often talking horses or foxes or birds rules and people breaking rules

Fairy tales were passed down by speaking of it from person to person before writing was developed Stories were told or acted out dramatically Because of this the history of fairy tales is not very clear The oldest written fairy tales we know are from ancient Egypt around 1300 BC There are sometimes fairy tales in written literature in different cultures such as The Golden Ass which includes Cupid and Psyche They show that fairy tales were told from very long ago

A game show is a program where people play a game for points with the goal of winning money or prizes Different game shows use different games Some game shows involve word games and others involve tests of skill or general knowledge Many game shows incorporate some element of chance for example in Wheel of Fortune contestants spin a wheel to determine how much prize money they will have to wager

Some game shows have the contestents compete against other individual contestants other game shows group contestants into teams Some game shows have regular people as the contestants Other game shows have celebrities such as movie actors or musicians as the contestants 

Many game shows air on the Game Show Network and stations like NBC ABC and G4

Game shows often reward people with money holidays or cars These prizes are often given by the people or group of people that give the game show money to run The people who give the game show money to run are called sponsors 

The first game shows were on radio

Examples of game shows include

A genre is a style or type of music literature movies and other media Different pop music genres include rock and roll hip hop and pop punk Some of the different literature genres include detective stories mystery stories and romance novels Some of the different movie genres include comedy romance action movies and film noir Other media that have genres include television and theater

Some genres are used in more than one form of art or communication For example the genre of fantasy is used in literature movies and television The genre of science fiction is also used in literature movies and television

Kristy Swanson is an American actress She is best known for playing the title character in the movie Buffy the Vampire Slayer and has also starred in the film Flowers in the Attic

The Octopus is a cephalopod mollusc in the order Octopoda Octopuses have two eyes and four pairs of arms equipped with suckers An octopus has a hard beak and its mouth is at the center point of the arms 

Most octopuses have no internal or external skeleton allowing them to squeeze through tight places Octopuses are intelligent predators with a taste for crabs

The octopus inhabits many regions of the ocean especially coral reefs For defense against predators they hide flee quickly expel ink or use color changing camouflage They live rather short lives

An octopus trails its eight arms behind it as it swims All octopuses are venomous but only the small blue ringed octopuses are known to be deadly to humans

There are about 300 octopus species which is over one third of the total number of known cephalopods The term octopus may also be used to refer only to those creatures in the genus Octopus 

Unlike most other cephalopods most octopuses have only soft body with no internal skeleton They have no protective outer shell like the nautilus which is another type of cephalopod A beak similar in shape to a parrots beak is their only hard part

Because of this it is very easy for an octopus to squeeze through very narrow openings between rocks for example squeezing through a hole as big as its eye

Octopuses are highly intelligent probably more so than any other invertebrate The exact extent of their intelligence and learning capability is much debated among biologists Maze and problem solving experiments have shown that they do have both short and long term memory Their short lifespans limit the amount they can learn 

Some octopuses such as the Mimic Octopus can move their arms in ways which copy the movements of other sea creatures

In laboratory experiments octopuses can be readily trained to distinguish between different shapes and patterns They have been seen in what some have described as play repeatedly releasing bottles or toys into a circular current in their aquariums and then catching them Octopuses often break out of their aquaria and sometimes into others in search of food They have even boarded fishing boats and opened holds to eat crabs

In the UK cephalopods such as octopuses are regarded as honorary vertebrates under the Animals Act 1986 giving them protection not normally afforded to invertebrates

The octopus is the only invertebrate which has been conclusively shown to use tools At least four specimens of the Veined Octopus have been seen picking up discarded coconut shells and then reassembling them to use as shelter

Octopods are active and intelligent predators with good eyesight and brains They eat mostly crabs and some fish Some species of octopuses eat other octopuses 

Octopods have a variety of defences They use active camouflage and mimicry controlled by their nervous system Most can eject black ink clouds to help escape and some can shed an arm in extreme danger It wriggles and attracts the attacker

Octopuses eyes are complex In fact the octopus does not have a blind spot A blind spot is a special place in the eyes that is not able to sense light So when we look somewhere part of what is there is not actually perceived However an octopus does not have this problem

Octopus eyes lens are movable It moves back and forth to focus This is the way a camera focuses When a camera focuses on an object to take a picture the lens moves back and forth until the image that the camera sees is in the right focus

Some octopuses can use their chromatophores for more than camouflage If they are not blending in with their surroundings they can signal their feelings using color When they are relaxed for example they are a dull grayish brown or orange tinged color When they become angry they can become red If they feel scared they may turn white

When octopuses reproduce males use a specialized arm to put packets of sperm into the females mantle cavity Males die within a few months of mating In some species the female octopus can keep the sperm alive inside her for weeks until her eggs are mature

After they have been fertilized the female lays about 200000 eggs The female cares for the eggs guarding them against predators and gently blowing currents of water over them so that they get enough oxygen The female does not hunt during the roughly one month period spent taking care of the unhatched eggs and may ingest some of her own arms for sustenance 

At around the time the eggs hatch the mother leaves the lair and is too weak to defend herself from predators like cod often succumbing to their attacks The young larval octopuses spend a period of time drifting in clouds of plankton where they feed until they are ready to descend to the ocean bottom where the cycle repeats

Octopuses have a relatively short life expectancy and some species live for as little as six months Larger species such as the North Pacific Giant Octopus may live for up to five years under suitable circumstances 

Reproduction is a cause of death males can only live for a few months after mating and females die shortly after their eggs hatch They neglect to eat during the one month period spent taking care of their unhatched eggs but apparently they do not die of starvation A biological explanation of these short lifespans is not agreed at present

The Byzantine Empire was the name of the Greek part of the Roman Empire which survived into the Middle Ages Its capital was Constantinople which today is in Turkey and is now called Istanbul Unlike the Western Roman Empire its people spoke Greek not Latin and had a largely Greek culture and identity

The Roman Emperor Constantine I moved the capital of the Roman Empire to the city of Byzantium and he renamed the city Constantinople Many years later after the city of Rome was taken over by Germanic people the Roman Empire was moved to Constantinople and a new empire was born The new empire had a smaller territory than the original Roman Empire

The Byzantine Empire tried to take back Rome and Italy from the Germans Between 500600 AD the Byzantines won many battles and took back Rome

These gains did not last however More Germans came and eventually Italy and Rome was lost again Worse was to come when Avar peoples came to take Bulgaria and Greece from the Byzantines After a few battles the Avars won much of northern Greece and Bulgaria These Avars later called themselves Bulgarians

After Rome was captured by Germanic People the Byzantine Empire continued to control Egypt Greece Palestine Syria and Turkey However another Empire known as the Persian Empire tried to take over these lands for itself Between 476628 AD the Byzantines and the Persians fought many battles with many men killed in the fighting Eventually the Persians were finally defeated in modern day Iraq near the ancient city of Nineveh in 627 AD allowing the Byzantines to keep their lands

After this another enemy appeared the Arabs The Byzantines were economically damaged by the battles with the Persians They could not withstand the Arabs Palestine Syria and Egypt were lost However the Byzantines defended Turkey well and the Arab advance stopped

In 717 AD the Arabs were defeated outside of the Byzantine Capital Constantinople ending the Arab threat in the east In the west the Byzantines launched a number of attacks against the Bulgarians Some of these were successful others were not and led to the deaths of many Emperors In time the Byzantine Empire became stronger and her enemies around her weaker as they fought amongst themselves

Between 10071014 the Byzantine Emperor Basil II attacked Bulgaria many times and eventually won a great victory Later he fully recaptured Greece adding it back to the Byzantine Empire He then went on to conquer Bulgaria which was completed in 1018

In the east the Arabs once again became a threat to the Empire However Basil IIs attacks won many more victories Much of Syria was restored to the Empire and Turkey and Armenia were secured After 1025 the Arabs were no longer a threat to the Byzantine Empire

After the good Byzantine Emperor Basil II died many bad Emperors came to the throne They wasted the money of the Empire and reduced her army This meant that she could not defend herself well against her enemies if they would attack Later the Byzantines relied on soldiers who fought for money and not for their country so they were less reliable but more expensive

A large number of people known as the Turks rode on horseback from central Asia and attacked the Byzantine Empire They took all of Turkey from the Byzantines by 1091 However the Byzantines received help from people in Europe This help is known as the First Crusade Many knights and soldiers left to help the Byzantines but also to secure Jerusalem for Christians which at the time was in Muslim hands

The Byzantine Empire survived and with the help of the Europeans took back half of Turkey from the Turks with the other half remaining under the Turks The Byzantines survived because three good Emperors ruled one after the other allowing the Byzantines to grow strong again

After the three good Emperors the remaining Emperors ruled badly and again wasted a lot of money and soldiers

In the west the Europeans betrayed the Byzantines and attacked their capital Constantinople The Byzantines lost their capital in 1204 and they did not take it back until 1261 The Byzantines were then divided into many smaller Greek states that were fighting with each other for the throne of the Empire

After the Byzantines took back Constantinople they were too busy fighting the Europeans who had betrayed them and could not find enough soldiers or money to fight the Turks Eventually all of Turkey was lost by 1331

In 1354 the Turks crossed over from Turkey and into Greece taking over much of Greece between 13541450 The Byzantines lost so much land money and soldiers that they became very weak and begged for help from the Europeans Some soldiers and ships came from Italy and the Pope to assist the Byzantines when the Turks attacked Constantinople in April 1453 They were very outnumbered though and the walls of Constantinople were badly damaged by cannons used by the Turks At the end of May 1453 the Turks captured Constantinople by entering through one of the gates along the walls and the Empire came to an end As with many medieval conquests the people of the captured city were killed or taken captive and many buildings were damaged by robbers and looters Constantinople became the capital of the Ottoman Empire which it would be until the 1900s when the capital was moved to Ankara a city in the Asian part of Turkey

The Empire had many achievements

The guqin is the modern name for a plucked seven string Chinese musical instrument of the zither family It has been played since ancient times and has traditionally been favored by educated people as an instrument of great beauty and refinement It is uncommonly spelt as Gu Qin in English

Traditionally the instrument was called simply qin but by the 20th century the term had come to be used on many other musical instruments as well so the prefix gu  was added for clarification It can also be called qixianqin The guqin is not to be confused with the guzheng another Chinese long zither also without frets but with moveable bridges under each string Because Robert Hans van Guliks famous book about the qin is called The Lore of the Chinese Lute the qin is sometimes inaccurately called a lute Other incorrect classifications include harp or table harp

The qin is a very quiet instrument with a range of about four octaves and its open strings are tuned in the bass register Sounds are produced by broken wikt linkpluckplucking open strings stopped strings and harmonics Stopped sounds are special for the variety of slides and ornaments used and the use of glissando gives it a sound similar to a pizzicato cello or fretless bass guitar Extended sections in music scores consisting entirely of harmonics are common this made possible because the 91 indicated harmonic positions allow great flexibility early tablature shows that even more harmonic positions were used in the past By tradition the qin originally had five strings but ancient qin like instruments with 10 or more strings have been found The modern form has been standardized from about two thousand years

Legend has it that the qin has a history of about 5000 years that the legendary people of Chinas pre history Fuxi Shennong and Huang Di was involved in its creation It is mentioned in Chinese writings dating back nearly 3000 years and related instruments have been found in tombs from about 2500 years ago Chinese tradition says the qin originally had five strings but then two were added about 1000 BCE making seven 

Based on the detailed description in the poetic essay Qin Fu by Xi Kang Ji Kang the form of the qin that is recognizable today was most likely set around the late Han Dynasty The earliest surviving qin in this modern form preserved in both Japan and China have been dated to the Tang Dynasty Many are still playable the most famous perhaps being the one named Jiuxiao Huanpei said to have been made by the famous late Tang dynasty qin maker Lei Wei It is kept in the Forbidden City Museum in Beijing  

According to Robert Temple the qin played an important part in the gaining the first understanding of music timbre for the Chinese He said that the Chinese understanding of the nature of sound as vibration was much increased by studying the production of timbre on the strings of the chin This understanding of timbre overtones and higher harmonics eventually led the Chinese to discover equal temperament in music 

In 1977 a recording of Liu Shui was chosen to be included in the Voyager Golden Record a gold plated LP recording containing music from around the world which was sent into outer space by NASA on the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecrafts It is the longest music track included on the disc In 2003 guqin music was proclaimed one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO

Because of the difference in geography in China many qin schools known as qin pai developed over the centuries Such schools generally formed around areas where qin activity was greatest 

The main schools are 

Most qin schools and groups are based in China During the 20th century some societies began in other countries Qin study was initially confined to China in ancient times Today countries like Japan also have their own qin small traditions The Tokyo Qin Society was recently founded Japan has published a qinpu in the past known as Toukou Kinpu or Donggao Qinpu 

There have been many players throughout the ages The instrument was a favourite of the scholars so many artists played it Some famous players are also associated with some melodies like Confucius and Qu Yuan 

Historical

Classical books such as Qin Shi Qinshi Bu and Qinshi Xu have biographies of hundreds of more players

The beauty of qin melodies comes not only from the melodies themselves but from the variation a player can apply to the individual tones and their combinations The rich tones of the qin can be categorised as three distinctively different sounds The first is san yin which means scattered sounds This meant simply pluck the required string to sound an open note The second is fan yin or floating sounds These are harmonics and the player simply lightly touches the string with one or more fingers of the left hand at a position indicated by the white hui dots pluck and then lift creating a crisp and clear sound ringing sound The third is an yin    or stopped sounds This forms the majority of most qin pieces and requires the player to press on a string with a finger or thumb of the left hand until it touches with the surface board then pluck Afterwards the hand can slide up and down thereby changing the pitch 

When plucking the strings it is not required to attach fake nails on ones fingers One will often leave their fingernails long and cut them into an rounded shape The length is subjective and will depend on the players preference but it is usually around 3 4mm from the finger tip If it is too short then the finger tip will deaden the sound as it touches the string after the nail has plucked it If it is too long then the fingers can make playing difficult Generally the nails of the right hand are kept long whilst the nails of the left are cut short so as to be able to press on the strings without difficulty 

There are eight basic right hand finger techniques pi tuo mo tiao gou ti da and zhai the little finger is not used Out of these basic eight their combinations create many more Cuo is to pluck two strings at the same time lun is to pluck a string with the ring middle and index finger out in quick succession the suo technique involves plucking a string several times in a fixed rhythm bo cups the fingers and strums two strings at the same time and gun fu is to create a sequence of sounds by running up and down the strings continuously with the index and middle fingers These are just a few 

Left hand techniques start from the simple pressing down on the string sliding up or down to the next note to vibrati by swaying the hand plucking the string with the thumb whilst the ring finger stops the string at the lower position hammering on a string using the thumb to more difficult techniques such as pressing on several strings at the same time 

Techniques executed by both hands together are more difficult to achieve for example qia cuo san sheng to more exciting forms like pressing of all seven strings with the left then strumming all the strings with the right then the left hand quickly moves up the qin creating a rolling sound like a bucket of water being thrown in a deep pool of water 

In order to master the qin there are in excess of 50 different techniques that must be mastered Even the most commonly used are difficult to get right without proper instruction from a teacher 

Written qin music did not directly tell what notes were played like many outer musical instruments instead it was written in a tablature detailing tuning finger positions and plucking technique thus made up of a step by step method and description of how to play a piece Some tablatures do indicate notes using the gongche notation system or indicate rhythm using dots 

The earliest example of the modern shorthand tablature survives from around the 12th century CE An earlier form of music notation from the Tang era survives in just one manuscript dated to the 7th century CE called Jieshi Diao You Lan It is written in a longhand form called wenzi pu which gives all the details using ordinary written Chinese characters Later in the Tang dynasty Cao Rou and others simplified the notation using only the important elements of the characters and combined them into one character notation This meant that instead of having two lines of written text to describe a few notes a single character could represent one note or sometimes as many as nine This notation form was called jianzi pu and it was a great step forward for recording qin scores It was so successful that from the Ming dynasty onwards a lot of qinpu appeared the most famous and useful being Shenqi Mipu compiled by Zhu Quan the 17th son of the founder of the Ming dynasty In the 1960s Zha Fuxi discovered more than 130 qinpu that contain well over 3360 pieces of written music Many qinpu compiled before the Ming dynasty are now lost and many pieces have remained unplayed for hundreds of years 

Existing qinpu generally come from private collections or in public libraries throughout China etc Those that are available for public purchase are photographic copies printed and bound in the traditional Chinese bookbinding process More modern qinpu tend to be bound in the normal Western way on modern paper The format uses qin notation with staff notation andor jianpu notation 

Qin pieces are usually around three to eight minutes in length with the longest being Guangling San which is 22 minutes long Other famous pieces include Liu Shui Yangguan San Die Meihua San Nong Xiao Xiang Shui Yun and Pingsha Luo Yan The average player can generally play around ten pieces from memory which they will aim to play very well learning new pieces as and when they feel like it Players mainly learn popular well studied versions often using a recording as a reference In addition to learning to play established or ancient pieces very well highly skilled qin players may also compose or improvise although the player must be very good and extremely familiar with the instrument to be successful at it

Dapu is the conversion of old tablature into a playable form This can be used to create new music as well as to reconstruct the ancient melodies Since qin tablature does not indicate note value tempo or rhythm the player must work it out for himherself Normally qin players will learn the rhythm of a piece through a teacher They sit facing one another with the student copying the master The tablature will only be looked at if the teacher is not sure of how to play a certain part Because of this traditional qinpu do not indicate them If one did not have a teacher then one had to work out the rhythm by themselves But it would be a mistake to say that qin music has no rhythm or melody By the 20th century there had been attempts to try to replace the shorthand notation but so far it has been unsuccessful since the 20th century qin music is generally printed with staff notation above the qin tablature Because qin tablature is so useful logical easy and the fastest way of learning a piece it is invaluable to the qin player and cannot totally be replaced There are two views of how to best use dapu one is to use it to create new music and the other is to use it to reconstruct the way the original music was played 

According to tradition the qin originally had five strings representing the five elements of metal wood water fire and earth Later in the Zhou dynasty Zhou Wen Wang added a sixth string to mourn his son Bo Yihou His successor Zhou Wu Wang added a seventh string to motivate his troops into battle with the Shang The thirteen hui on the surface represent the 13 months of the year The surface board is round to represent Heaven and the bottom board flat to represent earth The entire length of the qin is 3 feet 65 inches representing the 365 days of the year Each part of the qin has meaning some more obvious like dragon pool and phoenix pond 

The sound chamber of the qin is constructed with two boards of wood typically of differing wood types The slightly rounded top board is usually made of tong wood the Chinese parasol tree or Chinese paulownia The bottom board is made of zi mu catalpa or more recently nan mu camphor wood The wood must be well aged that is the sap and moisture must be removed If sap remains then the sound will not be clear and as the moisture evaporates the wood will warp and crack Some makers use old or ancient wood to construct qins because most of the sap and moisture has been removed naturally by time Some go to lengths to obtain extremely ancient wood such as that from Han dynasty tomb structures or coffins Although such wood is very dry it is not necessarily the best since it may be infected with wood worm or be of a bad quality or type Many modern qins made out of new tong wood can be better than the quality of antique qins 

There are two sound holes in the bottom board as the playing techniques of the qin employ the entire surface of the top board which is curved humped The inside of the top board is hollowed out to a degree Inside the qin there are nayin sound absorbers and a tian chu and di chu soundposts that connect the bottom board to the top The boards are joined using bamboo nails Lacquer from the Chinese lacquer tree is then applied to the surfaces of the qin mixed with various types of powder the most common being lujiao shuang the remains of deer antler after the glue has been eremoved Often ceramic powder is used instead of deer antler powder but the quality is not as good After the lacquer has dried the surface will be polished using oil stones At the head end of the instrument is the yue shan or bridge and at the other end is the long yin or nut There are 13 circular mother of pearl inlays which mark the harmonic positions as well as a reference point to note position called hui 

Until the Cultural Revolution the guqins strings were always made of various thicknesses of twisted silk but since then most players use modern nylon flatwound steel strings This was partly due to the scarcity of high quality silk strings and partly due to the newer strings greater durability and louder tone

Silk strings are made by gathering a prescribed number of strands of silk thread then twisting them tightly together The twisted cord of strings is then wrapped around a frame and immersed in a vat of liquid of natural glue that binds the strands together The strings are taken out and left to dry before being cut into the appropriate length The top thicker strings are further wrapped in a thin silk thread coiled around the core to make it smoother 

Recently in China production of very good quality silk strings has resumed and more players are beginning to use them Although most contemporary players use nylon wrapped metal strings some argue that nylon wrapped metal strings cannot replace silk strings for their refinement of tone Furthermore it is the case that nylon wrapped metal strings can cause damage to the wood of old qins Many traditionalists feel that the sound of the fingers of the left hand sliding on the strings to be a distinctive feature of qin music The modern nylon wrapped metal strings were very smooth in the past but are now slightly modified in order to capture these sliding sounds

To string a qin one traditionally had to tie a butterfly knot at one end of the string and slip the string through the twisted cord which goes into holes at the head of the qin and then out the bottom through the tuning pegs The string is dragged over the bridge across the surface board over the nut to the back of the qin where the end is wrapped around two legs Afterwards the strings are fine tuned using the tuning pegs The most common tuning zheng diao is pentatonic 1245612 in the traditional Chinese number system or jianpu Today this is generally interpreted to mean C D F G A c d but this should be considered do re fa so la do re since historically the qin was not tuned to absolute pitch In fact the same tuning can also be considered as 5612356 when the third string is played as do Thus except when accompanied by other instruments only the pitch relations between the seven strings needs to be accurate Other tunings are achieved by adjusting the tension of the strings using the tuning pegs at the head end Thus manjiao diao gives 1235612 and ruibin diao gives 1245712 which is transposed to 2356123 

The guqin is nearly always used a solo single instrument as its quietness of tone means that it cannot be heard over the sounds of most other instruments or an ensemble It can however be played together with a xiao with other qin or played while singing In old times the se was frequently used in duets with the qin 

In order for an instrument to accompany the qin its sound must be mellow and not overwhelm the qin Thus the xiao generally used for this purpose is one pitched in the key of F known as qin xiao which is narrower than an ordinary xiao If one sings to qin songs then one should not sing in an operatic or folk style as is common in China but rather in a very low pitched and deep way and the range in which one should sing should not exceed one and a half octaves The style of singing is similar to that used to recite Tang poetry To enjoy qin songs one must learn to become accustomed to the strange style some players may sing their songs to

Traditionally the qin was played in a quiet studio or room by oneself or with a few friends or played outdoors in places of outstanding natural beauty Nowadays many qin players perform at concerts in large concert halls almost always out of necessity using electronic pickups or microphones to amplify the sound Many qin players attend yaji at which a number of qin players music lovers or anyone with an interest in Chinese culture can come along to discuss and play the qin
