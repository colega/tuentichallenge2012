Cumulative voting is a system for doing an election There are a certain number of choices Each voter has a certain number of points he or she can spread over the choices That way it is possible to choose more than one option and to weigh the choices Usually this applies when there is more than one position being elected at the same time For example it can be used to elect more than one member of a governing board In cumulative voting if five positions are to be elected a voter could cast one vote for each of five different candidates or the voter could give all five of his votes to one candidate or two votes to one candidate and three votes to a different candidate Bullet voting is giving all of the votes to one candidate

Cumulative voting is used to elect representatives in many companies It is also used to elect some governments Switzerland and Germany use it for some elections 

It will lead to a proportional representation

Proportional representation is a system used to elect a countrys government If proportional representation is used in an election a political party that wins 10 of the vote will win 10 of the seats in parliament and a party that wins 20 of the vote will win 20 of the seats 

If a party wins over 50 of the vote it wins over 50 of the seats and can form a government however this does not happen very often because most countries have lots of different political parties If no party wins over 50 of the vote then a coalition government usually has to be formed where a government is formed from two or more different political parties who together have over 50 of the seats in parliament

Countries which use proportional representation include Austria Argentina Belgium Brazil Bulgaria Czech Republic Denmark Estonia Finland Greece Iceland Israel Netherlands Norway Poland Portugal Romania Russia South Africa South Korea Spain Sweden Switzerland and Turkey

Countries which have systems that are similar or partly use proportional representation include Australia Germany Hungary India Republic of Ireland Italy Japan Mexico New Zealand Scotland Thailand and Wales

The following is from a 1965 essay

Most American white men are trained to be fags For this reason it is no wonder their faces are weak and blank The average ofay white person thinks of the black man as potentially raping every white lady in sight Which is true in the sense that the black man should want to rob the white man of everything he has But for most whites the guilt of the robbery is the guilt of rape That is they know in their deepest hearts that they should be robbed and the white woman understands that only in the rape sequence is she likely to get cleanly viciously popped

Wind power in Texas consists of many wind farms with a total installed generating capacity of 9410 MW from over 40 different projects Texas produces the most wind power of any US state followed by Iowa with 3670 MW 

Several forces are working to the advantage of wind power in Texas the wind resource in many areas of the state is very large large projects are relatively easy to site and the market price for electricity is relatively high because it is set by natural gas prices The wind power industry is also creating many jobs and farmers may earn extra income by leasing their land to wind developers

The Roscoe Wind Farm is the worlds largest wind farm Other large wind farms in Texas include Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center Sherbino Wind Farm Capricorn Ridge Wind Farm Sweetwater Wind Farm Buffalo Gap Wind Farm King Mountain Wind Farm Desert Sky Wind Farm Wildorado Wind Ranch and the Brazos Wind Farm

Wind power has a long history in Texas West Texas State University began wind energy research in 1970 and led to the formation of the Alternative Energy Institute in 1977 AEI has been a major information resource about wind energy for Texas

Texas is firmly established as the leader in wind power development in the USA ahead of Iowa and California The expanding wind power market will help Texas meet its 2015 renewable energy goal of 5000 new megawatts of power from renewable sources

The table below lists the larger wind farms in Texas currently operating or under construction Wind farms which are smaller than 120 MW in capacity are not shown

Several forces are driving the growth of wind power in Texas the wind resource in many areas of the state is very large large projects are relatively easy to site and the market price for electricity is set by natural gas prices and so is relatively high The broad scope and geographical extent of wind farms in Texas is considerable Wind resource areas in the Texas Panhandle along the Gulf Coast south of Galveston and in the mountain passes and ridge tops of the Trans Pecos offer Texas some of the greatest wind power potential in the United States Currently there are over 2000 wind turbines in West Texas alone Most of the new wind capacity added in the last two years has been in the Abilene Sweetwater area The Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center is the largest wind power facility in the nation with a total capacity of 735 MW It is spread across approximately 47000 acres in Taylor and Nolan County near Abilene 

Wind is a highly variable resource but with proper understanding it can be readily incorporated into an electric utilitys generation mix Many areas contain areas with winds presently suitable for electric power generation The number of commercially attractive sites will expand as wind turbine technology improves and development costs continue to drop

Texas farmers may lease their land to wind developers for either a set rental per turbine or for a small percentage of gross annual revenue from the project This offers farmers a fresh revenue stream without impacting traditional farming and grazing practices Although leasing arrangements vary widely the U S Government Accountability Office reported in 2004 that a farmer who leases land to a wind project developer can generally obtain royalties of 3000 to 5000 per turbine per year in lease payments These figures are rising as larger wind turbines are being produced and installed

The wind power industry is also creating thousands of jobs for communities and for the state Wind technology and the various aspects of producing electricity from wind power can help to keep employment in Texas after the rigs stop producing oil

Terrorism and industrial accidents can be potential threats to the large centrally located power plants that provide most of Texas electricity Should one of these plants be damaged repairs could take more than a year possibly creating power shortages on a scale that Texans have never experienced before Coal trains and gas pipelines are also vulnerable to disruption However wind power plants are quickly installed and repaired The modular structure of a wind farm also means that if one turbine is damaged the overall output of the plant is not significantly affected

Theodorus Dorus Rijkers was a famous Dutch lifeboat captain and folk hero he is most famous for his sea rescues of 487 shipwrecked victims over a total of 38 rescue operations and at least 25 before joining the lifeboat service

Dorus received his nickname Grandpa while still a young man He had married Neeltje Huisman a fishermans widow who already had 6 children Shortly after the marriage the oldest of Neeltjes daughters had a child of her own and so at only 23 years old Dorus became known as Opa in Den Helder where he lived Although the nickname began as a joke Dorus soon started acting and looking like a grandpa and from that time on he became primarily known by his nickname

Dorus gained most of his fame as a result of his service to the Noord en zuid Hollandsche Redding Maatschappij one of the two main Dutch lifeboat societies at the time The NZHRM would later become the Koninklijke Nederlandse Redding Maatschappij 

However his life saving career began in 1872 before he joined the NZHRM while acting as captain of his own boat While at sea he saved all 25 crew members of the barque Australia from drowning at sea Because of this incident Dorus gained a reputation as a rescuer which preceded his joining the NZHRM as a volunteer On the basis of his reputation he was granted the position of coxswain upon joining the NZHRM without having to prove his qualifications His rank of coxswain entitled him to immediately command his own boat and crew 

Although Dorus joined the NZHRM as a volunteer he worked so many hours that it precluded him from taking on other paid work Dorus and all of his crew members received a sum for each trial and each service

During his nearly 30 years service with the NZHRM Dorus saved hundreds of people from drowning at sea becoming legendary long before his retirement In the waters where he served he saved such large number of people with such effectiveness that the survival statistics increased dramatically At the end of his career although he remained active his role became more symbolic in nature FactdateMay 2007

T2 was a good movie as audience and critics say It had an impact on the people and is known by many to have had power in the genres of action and science fiction The movies visual effects include many discoveries in computer made special effects marking the first use of natural human movement for a CG character and the first computer made main character

In 1994 ten years after Sarah Connor killed the original Terminator that was sent to kill her two men arrive in Los Angeles from the year 2029 The first is a Terminator identical to the one that Sarah first met while the second is an unknown man

John Connor is now living with foster parents He has grown up being told by his mother that he would someday lead the human race to beat the machines Sarah has changed a lot because since the first movie  being stronger in mind and body  making people think she is crazy and so she is sent to a mental hospital  Pescadero State Hospital

Meanwhile the Terminator and the unknown man both find John Connor in a shopping mall Then there is a twist the unknown man is not the one who is ment to stop John getting killed as the people watching thought so based on the first movie The killing machine from the first movie is now the one ment to stop John getting killed and the other man is another Terminator trying to kill John When the good Terminator rescues John he tells him what is happening He is a Model 101 made by the future John Connor to act as the one to keep him from harm The other Terminator is a T 1000 sent to kill him It is made of mimetic polyalloy or liquid metal making it able to morph anyone or anything of equal size except complex machines like guns and explosives because they have chemicals moving parts It can however form knives and stabbing weapons

When John learns that the T 1000 will copy Sarah and then kill her he and the Terminator go to rescue her Sarah is very afraid by it but after seeing it fight off the T 1000 she accepts that they need its help As they escape the city the Terminator tells her about the future of Skynet the supercomputer that will get rid of humans He tells her about its maker Miles Bennet Dyson who makes a learning computer that suddenly becomes self aware on August 4 1997 It begins learning very quickly and on August 29 1997 it launches nuclear missiles that kills most humans

Sarah John and the Terminator arrive in the desert at her friend Enrique Salcedas camp who has kept an underground weapons stash in the event that the war does happen Sarah plans to take John and flee over the line that is between the US and Mexico While at the camp she finds out that by killing Dyson she can stop Skynet from being made stopping the war with the machines After she leaves John and the Terminator figure out what she is going to do and take off after her At Dysons home Sarah tries to shoot him with sniper rifle but when she misses she finds that she can not kill him up close in front of his family When John and the Terminator arrive they tell Dyson of the bad things that will happen of his research They make sure he knows why they must break all the things to do with his chip idea including the CPU and arm from the first Terminator

Sarah John the Terminator and Dyson break into the Cyberdyne building and find the parts from the first Terminator While make bombs to blow up the rest security tells the police who show up in force When the SWAT team enters the building they shoot Dyson quite a few times which really hurts him he stays behind to press the button to blow the place up

They leave in a SWAT van with the T 1000 chasing them first in a helicopter then a liquid nitrogen truck The truck crashes into a steel mill this makes the tank to open and liquid nitrogen to spill all over the place freezing the T 1000 Even though the Terminator breaks him into many small pieces by shooting him they thaw and come back together The T 1000 and Model 101 begin to fight hand to hand with the T 1000 stabbing him through the power cell with a metal pole switching him off The T 1000 then goes to hunt John he turns himself into a Sarah copy As John finds the two Sarahs the Terminator who had turned itself back on using a different power source shoots the T 1000 with a grenade launcher throwing it back into a pit of molten metal melting it

After John throws the parts from the first Terminator into the molten metal the Terminator tells him that he too must die to stop his technology from being used to create Skynet He tells Sarah that he cannot kill himself and she must lower him into the steel As he goes down he reaches up with a thumbs up the last thing to go under The movie ends with a dark highway at night and Sarahs repetition of the phrase that Reese told her in the first movie The future is not set

Premier is sometimes used instead of Prime Minister But it is also the title of the leader of the government in some territories

When a colony is first allowed to elect its own government the head of the government is called the Chief Minister As the colony gets more able to rule itself it is given more powers and the title of the Chief Minister is changed to Premier When the colony becomes independent the Premier becomes a Prime Minister and British government ministers lose any authority to rule the new country

The leader of the federal governments in Australia and Canada is called the prime minister but the leader of the governments in Australian States and Canadian Provinces is called the Premier This is because the states and provinces are not independent

Premier can also mean first or best as in Premier Division or premier quality for Rugby League

I recently noticed we have followed two entirely different criteria to name the Actors by country subcategories We currently have several ones that follow the Actors from form while others use the Nationality actors one Shouldnt it be appropriate that we agree on either form to have a uniform criteria in these cases Which leads me to the second point which one is the one we should actually follow I personally lean towards the first one as it appears to be simpler but Id like to hear your thoughts on the matter before putting it into practice Best regards Phaedriel  1254 11 August 2007

From a technical point of view it is better to say that bureaucrats cannot deleteprotectblock and they only can promote other users to sysop or bureaucrat level and can rename user accounts and grant falgs to bot accounts However as Archer said it is usual for a user to become a bureaucrat after becoming a sysop so they will be sysopbureaucrat and the former means they can deleteprotectblock  Huji reply 1157 17 August 2007

Polar cyclones are large areas of low pressure They should not be confused with polar lows since people happen to use the same term for polar cyclones Polar cyclones are usually 1000 to 2000 kilometers wide in which the air is moving in a spiral counterclockwise fashion in the northern hemisphere The reason for the rotation is the same as tropical cyclones the Coriolis effect They also exist in places such as Greenland the Eurasian Arctic area and northern Canada with about 15 cyclones per winter Polar cyclones can form in any time of the year although summer polar cyclones are usually weaker than the ones that form in the winter Also they are not closely studied and are rarely destructive since they exist in areas with little or no population

Another common word to call geisha is Geiko This word was made in Kyoto and it is what they are called there Kyoto is the city where the geisha tradition is older and stronger Becoming a professional geisha in Kyoto usually takes five years of training

Apprentice geisha are called maiko This name is made of the Japanese words meaning dancing and meaning child Maiko wear white make up and kimono of many bright colors Full geisha wear simpler kimonos and only use white make up at special times

There are also geisha in other cities but they are different In Tokyo becoming a full geisha takes from six months to a year The Tokyo geisha apprentice is called hangyoku half jewel or o shaku one who serves Tokyo geisha are normally older than Kyoto geiko

Modern geisha still live in traditional geisha houses called okiya in neighborhoods named hanamachi However most older geisha who are successful have their own home The elegant world that geisha are a part of is called karykai A famous geisha Mineko Iwasaki said this is because geisha is like a flower beautiful in her own way and like a willow tree gracious flexible and strong

Geisha are more modern than many people think There were some women who worked as artists before geisha appeared since the Heian Period but the true geishas appeared much later In 1589 Toyotomi Hideyoshi authorized the building of a neighborhood in Kyoto closed from the outside with walls It was called Shimabara and it was dedicated to pleasure This included enjoying arts drinking and luxury prostitution Courtesans worked as expensive prostitutes and attracted rich clients Many artists also worked at the same houses to entertain the clients with music dancing and poetry For a long time these artists were men and they called themselves geisha hkan or taikomochi

Like many things in Japanese culture the world of courtesans became very complicated Every man who wished to be with an oiran had to follow difficult rituals and etiquette and only the very rich and noble could For this reason many tea houses appeared outside Shimabara At some of them some women practiced cheaper prostitution the sancha joro However other women who were called odoroki acted as dancers and musicians These women soon became very popular They started calling themselves geisha like the male artists who worked at Shimabara More or less by the year 1700 the female geisha became much more popular than the male ones A few years later almost all geisha were women

The government made laws that broken wikt linkprohibitionprohibited geisha to work as prostitutes and only gave them permission to act as entertainers One of these laws said that they had to tie their obi in the back to make it harder for them to take their kimono off Their hairstyle make up and kimono also had to be simpler than the oirans because their beauty had to be in their art not their bodies Soon the geisha became so much more popular than the oiran that by the year 1750 all oiran had disappeared Other new geisha neighborhoods were created in Kyoto and other cities

In the 19th century the geisha were in better position than common women but they also had problems in Japanese society Sometimes poor people sold their daughters to the hanamachi tea houses Some rich men called danna paid a lot of money to get personal attention from a geisha Geisha could not marry anymore so they could have a danna to pay for her expenses Other men paid a lot of money to take the new girls virginity But the reputation and respect for the geisha grew again in the Meiji Restoration and even more after World War II Important laws that protect them were created Young girls could not be sold to the tea houses anymore and the virginity of young geisha could not be bought Since then women only become geisha by their free will

Most of the activity of geisha today is located at the hanamachis of Kyoto and Tokyo In modern Japan they are almost never seen outside of them In the 1920s there were over 80000 geisha in Japan but today there are far fewer The main reason is the introduction of Western culture The exact number of geisha today is not known but is estimated to be from 1000 to 2000 Most women who appear as geisha for tourists are in fact actresses dressed as maikos

Young women who wish to become geisha now usually begin their training after finishing junior high school or even high school or college Many women begin their careers as adults Geisha still study traditional musical instruments like the shamisen shakuhachi and drums as well as traditional songs Japanese traditional dance tea ceremony literature and poetry By watching other geisha apprentices also become skilled in the difficult traditions of dressing make up and in dealing with clients

Geisha are often hired to go to parties and broken wikt linkgatheringgatherings normally at tea houses or at traditional Japanese restaurants Their time is measured by the time it takes an incense stick to burn and is called senkdai or gyokudai In Kyoto the terms ohana and hanadai meaning flower fees are used instead The clients hire the service of geisha through the Geisha Union Office which takes care of the geishas schedule and makes her appointments both for entertaining and for training

Traditionally geisha began their training at a very young age Although some girls were sold to become geisha as children this was not normal practice in hanamachi with good reputation Daughters of geisha were often educated as geisha themselves

The first stage of training is called shikomi In the past when girls first arrived at the okiya they were put to work as maids or do everything they were told The work was difficult to make and break the new girls The most broken wikt linkjuniorjunior shikomi of the house had to wait late into the night for the senior geisha to return from work sometimes as late as two or three in the morning During this stage of training the shikomi went to classes at the hanamachis geisha school In modern times this stage still exists but it is not as hard as it was in the past Now shikomis become used to the traditions and dress of the karykai

When the apprentice became skilled in the geisha arts and passed a final and difficult dance test she was promoted to the second stage of training minarai Minarai did not do the housework anymore This stage also exists today but is much shorter than in the past The minarai learn in the field They go to banquets and dance with the geishas but they do not participate they just sit watch and learn from their onee san Their kimono are more broken wikt linkelaborateelaborate than even a maikos to do the talking for them

After a short time the third stage of training begins called maiko Maiko are apprentice geisha and this stage can last for years Maiko learn from their senior geisha and follow them around to every broken wikt linkpresentationpresentation she does The onee sanimoto san relationship is very important The onee san teaches her maiko everything about working in the hanamachi She will teach her the right ways of serving tea playing the shamisen and dancing and everything about the art of Iki Maikos have to wear heavy white make up elaborate hairstyle and have her lips painted almost all the time Their kimonos and obi have more vibrant colors and richer embroidery than those of full geisha Like the minarai maikos do not charge as much money to go to parties or gatherings as a full geisha

After a period of only six months or five years the maiko is promoted to a full geisha and charges full price for her time Geisha use kimono of less colors and only use make up for work or dance because she is more broken wikt linkmaturitymature than a maiko and the simpler style shows her own natural beauty Geisha remain as such until they retire

Geisha must be very skilled at traditional Japanese music dance and poetry because they use all these arts when they work The art of make up hairstyles and clothing are very important too

However the most important principle of a geisha is called Iki Iki started in the 18th century as a reply to the extravagant ways of the courtesans and those who liked their style Oirans wore very elaborate clothes make up and jewelry Geisha preferred to be broken wikt linkdiscreetAdjectivediscreet and more intelligent They created iki as a style that gave more importance to conversation and wit Instead of working with sex like oirans did and simple prostitutes do today geisha try to be sexy A geisha will flirt broken wikt linkenticetease and joke with men but always with art and elegance Japanese clients know that nothing more can be expected Men enjoy the illusion of that which is never to be Geisha do not have sex with clients for money Geisha give more importance to their reputation than prostitutes do and they almost never enter a relationship with a client Those that do generally act with care usually get married Normally when a geisha marries she retires from the profession The most important quality of a geisha is her trustworthiness especially to Japanese clients Anything that her clients do or tell her must remain a secret Anything said or done at a tea house will remain anonymous

Becoming a geisha needs much discipline A geisha believes she must be a work of art in herself They work every day to improve in everything they do A geishas movements her way of walking sitting and talking are very important Geisha are geisha all the time even when they are not working or at home An example of this broken wikt linkdedicationdedication is the old custom of kangeiko Until the early 1920s apprentice geisha used to put their hands in icy water and then go outside in cold weather to practice playing the shamisen until their fingers bled

Midgley was born in Beaver Falls Pennsylvania His father was also an inventor He grew up in Columbus Ohio and graduated from Cornell University in 1911 with a degree in mechanical engineering His name was Thomas Midgley Jr because his fathers name was also Thomas Midgley

In 1921 Midgely discovered that if tetra ethyl lead was added to petrol it helped to stop the engine knocking The company he worked for Dayton Research Laboratories advertised the invention but they did not call it lead because everyone knew that lead was poisonous Instead they called it ethyl When lead was added to petrol huge amounts of lead went into the atmosphere causing health problems all over the world Midgley himself had to take long periods of holiday because his health was suffering through lead poisoning

Lead continued to be put into petrol although several people working at the factory in DuPonts Deepwater New Jersey died GM and Standard Oil continued by using a more dangerous high temperature method of using lead More people started to suffer from lead poisoning they started to hallucinate became insane and died In October 1924 Midgley talked at a press conference and told everybody that lead was safe He put a bottle of the chemical under his nose and breathed it in for a minute However the plant was shut down after that

In the 1930s Midgley developed a non poisonous substance called CFC for use in refrigerators inhalers and aerosol spray cans He was given many high awards for his work and in 1944 he became president and chairman of the American Chemical Society

In 1940 at the age of 51 Midgley became ill with polio which left him very disabled He found it difficult to get out of bed He decided to invent a complicated system of strings and pulleys to lift him from his bed One day he got caught up in the ropes and died of strangulation

Midgley died before the days when people realized that CFCs were destroying the ozone layer which prevents harmful rays from the sun reaching the earth They are now banned in refrigerators but are still used in some countries

In the United States it was not until 1973 that people started to produce gasoline without lead and in 1996 the Clean Air Act banned the sale of leaded fuel for use in on road vehicles However it was still legal in the US for aircraft racing cars farm equipment and marine engines until 2008 Leaded gasoline is still common in South America Africa and some parts of Asia and the Middle East

A polar low is a small sized and short lived atmospheric low pressure system that is found over the ocean areas pole ward of the main polar front in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres The systems usually have a horizontal length scale of less than 1000 km and live for less than a couple of days They are part of the larger class of mesoscale weather systems Polar lows can be difficult to detect using standard weather reports and are a problem to high latitude operations such as shipping and gas and oil platforms

Polar lows have been also known as by using many other terms such as comma cloud mesocyclone polar mesoscale vortex Arctic hurricane Arctic low and cold air depression Today the term is usually set aside for the more energetic systems that have near surface winds of at least gale force

Pericles or Perikles was a prominent and influential statesman He also was an orator and general of Athens He lived  between the Persian and Peloponnesian wars He was descended through his mother from the Alcmaeonid family

Pericles had a big influence on Athenian society Thucydides his contemporary historian described him as the first citizen of Athens Pericles turned the Delian League into an Athenian empire and led his countrymen during the first two years of the Peloponnesian War The period during which he led Athens roughly from 461 to 429 BC is sometimes known as the Age of Pericles though the period thus denoted can include times as early as the Persian Wars or as late as the next century

In Pericles late 20s he sponsored a major dramatic production for the festival of Dionysus and he also entertained the whole city Pericles also got married and had 2 sons They never found out his wifes name A decade later the people started to like him more and more He got involved with the politics called Ephialtes Pericles and Ephialtes took away the nobles powers and once they did that there would be consequences For what they did Pericles ally Ephialtes was later assassinated 

Pericles promoted the arts and literature This was a chief reason Athens holds the reputation of being the educational and cultural centre of the ancient Greek world He started an ambitious project that built most of the surviving structures on the Acropolis This project made the city more beautiful It also showed its glory and gave work to the people Furthermore Pericles fostered Athenian democracy to such an extent that critics call him a populist

Wind speed is the speed of the weather related air movement from one place to the next

Wind speeds usually mean the movement of air in an outside environment but the speed of movement of air inside is also important in many cases including weather forecasting aircraft and maritime operations construction and civil engineering High wind speeds can cause unpleasant side effects and strong winds often have special names including gales hurricanes and typhoons 

The most simple method of measuring wind speed is to estimate the speed from the observed event against the Beaufort Scale Obviously this method is not the most accurate available so each value on the scale represents a range of values three on the scale for example covers the wind speeds between seven and ten knots

Thebes is a city in Greece Today about 23000 people live there It lies on the border of Boeotia and Attica Archeologists have found a Mycenean settlement They have also found clay tablets written in Linear B script Thebes was once a super power in Greece until the rise of MacedoniaIt became a dominate power after their victory over the Spartans at the battle of Leuctra in 371 BC Thebes is located in Central Greece in Boetia

The Minoan civilisation was a civilisation on Crete an island near Greece It began in the Bronze Age between 3000 and 2700 BC and lasted to about 1450 BC The Minoan civilisation is famous for its sea trading and well planned cities The Minoans had an agricultural system which relied mainly on olives and grapes Their religion worshiped mostly goddesses The Minoan civilisation was later replaced by the Mycenaean culture

Cretans built one thing during their architecture era Palaces In a non royal palace there were many small rooms with cooler places to sit palaces served as many things They served as government centers storerooms stores and administrative offices Most palaces were huge Possibly the Cretans got all the money to create these palaces from working for the Egyptians But the royal palace was very different The king and queen had toilets baths and running water The kings and queens palace was super fancy The era was ended by a great fire This era went from 2000 BC to 1450 BC

The Apostles op 49 is an oratorio for soloists chorus and orchestra composed by Edward Elgar It was first performed on October 14 1903

Elgar had been thinking for many years about writing a musical work about Jesuss Twelve Apostles He was already 42 when his orchestral work Enigma Variations was first performed in 1899 He was then asked by the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival to compose a big work for the following year At first he thought of writing The Apostles but then he realized he would need more than a year to write it so he composed an oratorio called The Dream of Gerontius When it was first performed it was not a success This was because the orchestra and choir had only had two weeks to learn it and also because the conductor did not like Elgars music anyway Then it was performed in Dsseldorf in Germany and shortly afterwards in Westminster Cathedral London Both these performances were greeted with lots of applause Elgar was given a doctorate by the University of Cambridge and he was becoming famous He started to work on The Apostles and it was performed in Birmingham in 1903

Originally Elgar wanted to write three oratorios which would belong together The Apostles is the first one the second one became The Kingdom but the third one which would have been about the Last Judgement was never written

The oratorio is about the disciples of Jesus and the way they react to the amazing things that Jesus does There are six soloists the narrator  he has a tenor voice and also does the part of St John St Peter Jesus and Judas and the two female singers the soprano who is both the Blessed Virgin and the angel Gabriel and the mezzo soprano who is Mary Magdalene

Sometimes The Apostles is criticized for not being a carefully thought out dramatic story Elgar was more interested in what makes people behave in the way they do He was particularly interested in the two sinners Mary Magdalene and Judas Iscariot

The orchestra is very big The music includes the call of the shofar Often this is played on a brass instrument There is a double choir and a small choir

The work is in two parts and seven sections each played without a break Elgar chose the words himself He spent a lot of time looking at different translations of the Bible and combining sentences from several of the versions 

Unlike The Dream of Gerontius which people did not like the first time they heard it The Apostles was an immediate success with audience and critics People were getting used to the kind of big oratorio that Elgar was writing However today The Dream of Gerontius is the most popular of Elgars oratorios The Apostles is a strange mixture of words from different parts of the bible but it has some very beautiful music Elgar often wrote the music first and then added the words afterwards

Knots redirects here For other uses see Knot

A knot is a unit of speed It is abbreviated kt or kn It is a non SI unit accepted for use with the SI It is used around the world in meteorology and for maritime and aviation purposes 

1 international knot 1 nautical mile per hour 1852 kilometres per hour exactly This is based on the internationally agreed length of the nautical mile as adopted by the US in 1954 the UK in 1970 and other countries This is the definition used in most if not all modern circumstances Knot is sometimes used for the nautical mile itself but this is incorrect

The speed of a vessel relative to the fluid in which it travels is usually measured in knots This may be referred to as boat speed vessel speed and for aircraft air speed The speeds of relevant fluids such as tidal streams river currents and wind speeds are also usually specified in knots Knots are then also used to describe the actual speed of a vessel over the ground and for its rate of progress toward a distant point

One knot is the same as 1852 kilometres per hour and is approximately equal to the following

Although knots do not fit within the primary SI system they are used for nautical and aviation use for navigational reasons because the length of a nautical mile is almost identical to a minute of latitude As a result distance in nautical miles on a navigational chart can easily be measured by using broken wikt linkdividerdividers and the latitude indicators on the side of the chart

The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra is a British orchestra based in London It travels around to give concerts in many places

The RPO was started just after World War II in 1946 by the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham Beecham did not start to get his players together until three weeks before the first concert which took place in Croydon on September 15 1946 Beecham was principal conductor until his death in 1961

When the orchestra toured the United States in 1950 they were the first British orchestra to visit America since the London Symphony Orchestra in 1912

Beecham controlled all the organization of the orchestra After Beechams death the orchestra was made into a self governing group like the other London orchestras They went through some difficult years In 1963 the Royal Philharmonic Society decided they would stop asking the RPO to play for their concerts and in Glyndebourne where the RPO had played for the opera since 1948 the London Philharmonic Orchestra became the resident orchestra instead Sir Malcolm Sargent helped the orchestra to put on its own concerts at a cinema in north London

The orchestra had made an agreement with the Royal Philharmonic Society about the concerts it would play This meant it could call itself Royal In the 1960s the work they were doing no longer allowed them to call themselves Royal so in 1966 the Queen officially gave them the title Royal

In 1992 the orchestra appointed Peter Maxwell Davies as associate conductor and composer of the RPO

On April 7 1994 the Royal Philharmonic had the honour of performing at the Vatican in the historic Papal Concert to Commemorate the Holocaust with Sir Gilbert Levine

The RPO give a series of concerts in the Cadogan Hall London and in the Royal Albert Hall They tour all over Britain and also abroad In the period 2002 2007 they played in 30 different countries

The orchestra made many recordings with Sir Thomas Beecham In 1964 Igor Stravinsky recorded his opera The Rakes Progress with the RPO From 1964 to 1979 they recorded many Gilbert and Sullivan operas with the DOyly Carte Opera Company

The Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra is part of the same organization They spend their time playing lighter classical music The RPO have also worked with pop music groups and has given its own series of childrens concerts In 2007 they announced a series of free educational workshops for the local community

Sir Adrian Cedric Boult CH was an English conductor

Boult was born in Chester He went to school in Westminster School and studied at Christ Church Oxford He then went to the Leipzig Conservatory where he learnt to conduct by watching the great Hungarian conductor Arthur Nikisch He sang in choral festivals and at the Leeds Festival of 1913 where he went to watch Nikisch conduct

During World War I he worked for the War Office and while he was there in 1918 he planned a series of concerts with the London Symphony Orchestra which included several important new British works including Gustav Holsts The Planets A London Symphony by Ralph Vaughan Williams and Elgars Symphony No 2 When Boult was a boy he had already met Elgar Elgar now wrote to him and said he felt sure the future of his music was safe in Boults hands Boult was at the start of a great career in which he conducted a lot of 20th century British music

In 1924 Boult became conductor of the City of Birmingham Orchestranow the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestraand in 1930 he was made Director of Music at the BBC When the BBC formed the BBC Symphony Orchestra Boult also became its chief conductor combining both jobs

Boult became famous for conducting a wide repertoire including the very modern sounding music of Arnold Schoenberg In 1933 he married Ann Wilson the ex wife of the singer and administrator Steuart Wilson The marriage lasted until Boults death Boult was knighted in 1937

During World War II the BBC Symphony Orchestra was evacuated to Bristol Even there it was not safe from the bombing and they moved again to Bedford After the war the BBC started the BBC Third Programme and Boult was involved in many new plans for concerts and recordings

In 1948 Steuart Wilson became Director of Music at the BBC Some people were saying that the music on the BBC was not so good and that Boult ought to retire when he became 60 in 1949 He then became conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra with whom he made many recordings

Boult continued to conduct until he was very old His many recordings including music he had heard Nikisch conduct many years before His last public performance was conducting Elgars ballet The Sanguine Fan for London Festival Ballet at the Coliseum in London on 24 June 1978 

Boult was made a Companion of Honour in 1969

Boult wrote two books about conducting Thoughts on Conducting and A handbook on the technique of conducting He also wrote an autobiography My Own Trumpet He also gave talks on the radio He spoke in a very polite formal style

Boult always conducted with a baton His conducting was very graceful his movements were very simple and clear

Franz Lehr was an Austrian composer of Hungarian descent He was the leading composer of operettas in the 20th century He is still one of the most popular composers of light music

Lehr was born in Komron in the Austro Hungarian Empire Today the town is called Komrno and it is in Slovakia He was the eldest son of a bandmaster in the Austro Hungarian army He studied violin and composition at the Prague Conservatory Antonn Dvok told him he should be a composer After graduation in 1899 he joined his fathers band in Vienna as assistant bandmaster In 1902 he became conductor at the historic Vienna Theater an der Wien where his first opera Wiener Frauen was performed in November of that year

He is most famous for his operettas The best known one is The Merry Widow which is probably the most popular of all operettas He also wrote sonatas symphonic poems marches and a number of waltzes some of which come from his famous operettas Some of the songs from his operettas have become very well known especially Vilja from The Merry Widow and You Are My Hearts Delight from The Land of Smiles

The tenor Richard Tauber sang in many of his operettas Six of them had parts especially written for him

Lehr died in 1948 in Bad Ischl near Salzburg where he was also buried His villa in Bad Ischl is now a museum in his memory

The planet Neptune has a dim planetary ring system which is made up of several separate rings and some ring arcs The rings arcs are part of the outer ring called the Adams ring and are not to be seen anywhere else The ring particles are unusually dark colored and have large amounts of microscopic dust Neptune has thirteen known moons Four of them orbit the planet inside the outermost rings 

The rings around Neptune could not be seen from Earth with strong telescopes The evidence that they were there was first seen when scientists were watching the planet as it passed between the Earth and a star Scientists watched this happen 50 times and on five of those times in the early 1980s they saw the star give a little blink just before or after the planet covered it This meant that rings around the planet were blocking the light but the rings were not complete 

In 1989 the unmanned spacecraft Voyager 2 flew by Neptune Voyager 2 sent back pictures that gave most of the information that scientists now have about the rings of Neptune The pictures also help scientists to know why the rings looked incomplete Not only did the pictures give a closer view but they also showed the rings in a way that cannot ever be seen from earth From earth the rings are always seen with the light of the sun shining towards them When the spacecraft went past the planet it took pictures with the sun shining behind the rings as well Big particles in the rings looked dark against the sunlight but all tiny dust particles shone brightly when the sun was behind it This allowed the scientists to work out what the rings were made of and how all the particles were arranged

As better types of telescopes have been developed scientists can now see some of the rings from earth The brightness of Neptune makes it hard to see the rings which are much dimmer and the faintest rings still cannot be seen even with vey powerful telescopes

The most famous of Neptunes rings is the thin outer Adams ring although by comparison with the rings of the planets Saturn or Uranus it is very hard to see It was originally named as 1989 N1R The reason that the Adams ring is famous is that it has a feature that has not been seen on any other planetary rings These are three long narrow arcs which are much brighter and look more solid than the rest of the ring system Each one spans from 4 10 of the whole ring All the arcs are close to each other spanning under 40 of longitude only about 18th of the edge of the ring It has been a puzzle to understand why the stuff in these arcs does not spread out evenly through the whole ring

The three arcs have been named with French names Libert galit and Fraternit These names came from the famous saying of the French Revolution which translates into English as Liberty Equality and Brotherhood These names were suggested by the scientists who discovered them during stellar occultations in 1984 and 1985 

Of Neptunes 13 moons four of the are inside the ring system The one that is nearest to the Adams ring is called Galatea It is a lumpy mass of rock that orbits around the planet at about the same speed as the planet is rotating It is about 1000 kilometers inside the ring 

Many scientists now think that it is the effect of the moon Galatea that is causing the three arcs in the Adams ring The ring also has 42 wiggles which are like waves 30 kilometers high Scientists are able to use this information to work out the mass of the moon Galatea 

The best photos that came back from Voyager 2 showed that there are clumps of particles in the rings but no one can tell whether they are made of fine dust or if there may be bigger particles in the clumps as well All of Neptunes rings have a lot of microscopic dust but particularly the arcs of the Adams ring Scientists know this because they looked very bright in the photos that Voyager 2 took with the sun shining behind them

The Adams ring is very red The background particles that make up the ring look twice as bright near the three arcs as they do on the side of the ring that is opposite the arcs

With the arrival of the Hubble Space Telescope and adaptive optics ground based telescopes the ring arcs have been re examined several times starting in July 1998  This has showed that they are amazingly active changing a lot over only a few years Fraternit and galit have been exchanging material and changing their lengths noticeably Even more dramatically Libert appears to be fading away being only 30 of its original 1989 brightness in 2003 and hardly visible in Hubble Space Telescope images from June 2005 In the meantime it seems to have gotten a split two humped profile and wandered several degrees closer to the more stable galit Courage a very small and dim arc during the Voyager flyby was seen to flare in brightness in 1998 while more recently it was back to its usual dimness but had advanced by an additional 8 ahead of the other arcs That is it appears to have jumped over to the next stable corotation resonance position There were also some suggestions that the ring arcs may have been noramlly fading away However visible light observations show that the total amount of material in the arcs has remained approximately steady but they are dimmer in the infra red where previous observations were taken This activity of the ring arcs is not currently understood

In addition to the outer Adams Ring the other ring arrangements in the direction of Neptunes surface are

Voyager pictures appear to also suggest a wide disc of scattered material extending inside of the 50000 km radius which surrounds the Galle ring but is difficult to tell apart from Neptunes brightness and for this reason its existence is uncertain

The rings are named after astronomers who made important discoveries to the study of Neptune

Nitrogen fixation is the process by which nitrogen is taken from its stable gas form in air and changes into other nitrogen compounds useful for other chemical processes It is an important part of the nitrogen cycle

Nitrogen fixation is done four ways

Biological nitrogen fixation was discovered by Martinus Beijerinck

Britsk listy is an Internet cultural and political daily published in the Czech Republic It specialises in critical analysis of Czech politics some Czech commentators consider this as left wing views It is editorially open and will publish stimulating pieces by authors from any part of the political spectrum

The nitrogen cycle is the way that nitrogen in nature is changed into many different forms that are used by living organisms 

Air is about 78 nitrogen Nitrogen is needed for life It is an important part of proteins DNA and RNA In plants nitrogen is needed for photosynthesis and growth Nitrogen fixation is needed to change the nitrogen in air into forms that can be used by life Most nitrogen fixation is done by micro organisms called bacteria These bacteria have an enzyme that combines N2 with hydrogen gas to make ammonia Some of these bacteria live in the roots of plants In these roots they make ammonia for the plant and the plant gives them carbohydrates Other plants take nitrogen compounds out of the soil through their roots All nitrogen in animals comes from eating plants

Ammonium in soil is made by nitrogen fixing bacteria and decomposes bacteria and fungi that break down dead life into its parts This process is called ammonification Ammonium has a positive charge It easily joins to clay and humus in the soil Ammonia and ammonium are poisonous to fish and other animals Sewage and other waste water is regularly measured because of this If ammonia levels are too high nitrification must happen 

Nitrification is the change of ammonia and ammonium to nitrites and then to nitrates by bacteria Because nitrite and nitrate have a negative charge they do not easily join to soil and will wash out of the soil during rain and irrigation High nitrate levels in drinking water is harmful for babies and can cause blue baby syndrome High nitrate levels can also cause too much algae growth in lakes and pools This can be harmful to fish and other water animals because the algae uses oxygen that the animals need The use of fertilizers is controlled more and more because of this 

Where there is no oxygen some bacteria will make nitrate into nitrogen gas This starts the nitrogen cycle over again This process is called denitrification

In 1964 Legge thought the orchestra had done enough recordings and he was going to bring it to an end Both the orchestra and Klemperer wanted it to continue so the orchestra made their own organizing body and they continued calling themselves by a new name the New Philharmonia Orchestra They gave their first concert under their new name on 27 October 1964 It was a performance of Beethovens Symphony No 9 conducted by Klemperer

The orchestra gave many more concerts after it became self governing than it had when Legge had been organizing them Continuing as the New Philharmonia Orchestra it got its old name Philharmonia Orchestra back again in 1977 and has been known by that name ever since

Klemperer retired from conducting in 1971 but was officially still its principal conductor until his death in 1973  Since then the orchestra has been conducted by Lorin Maazel Riccardo Muti Giuseppe Sinopoli Christoph von Dohnnyi and Esa Pekka Salonen who has conducted them since 2008

Pygmy is a word that describes several ethnic groups with unusually short people According to anthropologists pygmies can be any group where adult men are less than convert150cmft tall on average The best known pygmies are the Aka Ef and Mbuti of central Africa There are also pygmies in Australia Thailand Malaysia Indonesia the Philippines Papua New Guinea and Brazil The Negritos of Southeast Asia are also called pygmies

The word pygmy is sometimes thought to be pejorative It is however the only word that is used to call all African Midgets The word Bayaka is sometimes used in the Central African Republic to refer to all local Pygmies In the Congo Basin pygmies are called the Kongo word Bambenga

The name pygmy comes from the Greek word This word was derived from the word which is the length between a persons elbow and knuckles The Latin word Pygmaeus came from this older Greek word

The word was first used in Greek mythology by the poet Homer He wrote about a tribe of dwarfs called Pygmies who lived in India and Ethiopia 

There are a number of theories to explain why pygmies are so short It has been proved that their height is hereditary and is passed on from parents to children It may have evolved because of the low ultraviolet light found in rainforests where many pygmies live This would mean that the pygmies would make less vitamin D in their skin Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium which is important for bones to grow Since the pygmies would get less calcium they would have smaller bones and skeletons

There are other explanations for why pygmies are so short Some explanations are 

Some research shows that the genes for the growth hormone receptor and growth hormone are found much less in pygmies than in related tribes These genes are important for humans to grow tall 

Pygmies can be found in in Rwanda Burundi Uganda the Democratic Republic of the Congo the Central African Republic Cameroon Equatorial Guinea Gabon Angola Botswana Namibia and Zambia Most of these groups are partly hunter gatherers They get food from the environment and trade it with nearby farmers From the farmers they get crops and tools There are about 250000 600000 Pygmies living in the Congo rainforest

There are a number of Pygmy groups living in Africa The three best known groups are the Mbenga Mbuti and Twa groups Each big group includes several tribes that have their own language 

The Mbenga people sometimes called the Ba Mbenga live in the western Congo basin The Mbenga include the Aka people who speak the Aka language The Aka live in the Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo The M Benzl people or western Aka and the Ba Sese people eastern Aka are also related 

Other Mbenga pygmies are the Baka people of Cameroon Gabon and Republic of Congo They speak three very similar languages Baka language Ganzi language and Gundi language Another group of Mbenga pygmies are the Gyele people The Gyele live in Cameroon and speak Gyele language

In Sanskrit Itihasa means history For Hindus an Itihasa is a religious story that tells about what happened in the past Itihasas are usually epic poems The three most important itihasas to Hindus are the Ramayana the Mahabharata and the Bhagavad Gita

The original meaning of Itiihaasa had a more precise connotation than the word History The etymology attested to by Panini indicates itiha to mean thus indeed in this tradition  One of the earliest references to Itihaasa in the literature of antiquity is in Chanakyass Arthashastra Our investigations lead us to believe that the Maurya empire for which he was the preceptor began in 1534 BCE He defines Itihaasa in the context of the syllabus prescribed for training of a Prince with the following words

  Puraana Itivrtta Akhyayika Udaaharana Dharmashastra and Arthashastra are known by History Kautilyas Arthashastra Book  1 Chapter 5 Thus History in this definition takes on the meaning more akin to the  sense of Historiography and is  perhaps even more eclectic and  appears to indicate a superset of political science and History as we use them today We feel vindicated therefore in calling our forthcoming conference a conference on Indian History since we seem to ascribe the same broad meaning that Kautilya did 3 millennia ago

The quintessential quote is that of Kalhana in the Rajatarangini12th century CE who is regarded as a modern in Indian parlance     Dharmaartha kaama moskshanaam upadesa samanvitam  Puraa vrttam kathaa yuttarupam Ithihaasah prachakshate 

History will be the narration of events as they happened in the form of a story which will be an advice to the reader to be followed in life to gain the purusaarthas namely Kama the satiation of desires through Artha the tool by following the path of Dharma the human code of conduct to gain Moksha or liberation Clearly there is an emphasis on the traditions and on the utilitarian aspect of History embedded in the etymology of Itihaasa The reason we draw emphasis to the ambiguity in the use of the word History is that in our usage while we adhere to the broader usage of the word History it makes for clarity in usage if the Civilizational aspects are distinguished into distinct categories

Tamamo no Mae is a legendary figure in Japanese mythology and folklore In the Otogizoshi a collection of Japanese prose written in the Muromachi period Tamamo no Mae was a courtesan under the Japanese Emperor Konoe She was said to be the most beautiful and intelligent woman in Japan Tamamo no Maes body mysteriously always smelled wonderful and her clothes never became dirty Tamamo no Mae was not only beautiful but she was very wise in all subjects Although she appeared to be only twenty years old there was no question that she could not answer She answered every question posed to her whether about music religion or astronomy Because of her beauty and intelligence everyone in the Imperial Court adored her and Emperor Konoe fell deeply in love with her 

After some time had passed the Emperor suddenly and mysteriously fell ill He went to many priests and fortune tellers for answers but they had none to offer Finally an astrologer told the Emperor that Tamamo no Mae was the cause of his illness The astrologer explained that the beautiful young woman was in fact an evil fox with nine tails who was making the Emperor ill in a evil plan to take the throne Following this Tamamo no Mae disappeared from the court

The Emperor ordered Kazusa no suke and Miura no suke the most powerful warriors of the day to hunt and kill the fox After escaping from the hunters for some time the fox appeared to Miura no suke in a dream Once again in the form of the beautiful Tamamo no Mae the fox told Miura nosuke would kill it the next day and begged for its life Miura no suke refused

Early the next day the hunters found the fox on the Plain of Nasu and Miura no suke shot and killed the magical creature with an arrow The body of the fox became the Sessho seki or Killing Stone which kills anyone that comes in contact with it Tamamo no Maes spirit became Hoji and haunted the stone

Hoji is said to have haunted this stone in the Japanese prefecture of Nasu until a Buddhist priest called Genno stopped for a rest near the stone and was threatened by Hoji Genno did a certain spiritual ritual and begged the spirit to consider her spiritual salvation until finally Hoji surrendered and swore to never haunt the stone again

The Game of Life is an imaginary robot game made by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970

The reason it is called a game is because people who play the game can set it up in different ways to make it do different things Sometimes people play the game by changing the way the imaginary robot is set up at the start to watch what happens A different type of game lets two players set up imaginary robots to see which one is better

The game is played on a grid of square called cells each cell is black or white When people are playing the game they start by making some dead cells alive Then the alive cells can make other cells alive or dead because of the rules of the game The rules are

The way a player sets up the first alive cells starts the game The first level is made by using the 4 rules After the player is done changing the cells they do the same thing all over again to make the next level The game is over when all the cells are dead or all the cells are alive or the game is doing the same thing over and over

John Horton Conway made the Game of Life because he wanted to know if he could make an imaginary robot out of cells that would be able to get bigger He combined lots of ideas in math to make the rules for the game It is one of the first ever simulation games which are games that reprent things that happen in real life It is important because when used in complicated math it can look at many things like physics biology economics and Philosophy

Patterns are special things that happen in the game Many different types of patterns happen including static patterns where nothing changes between levels repeating patterns where the cells that are alive and dead repeat and patterns that move themselves across the board Common examples of these three classes are shown below with live cells shown in black and dead cells shown in white

The block and boat do not change the blinker and toad have 2 looks that repeat and the glider and lightweight spaceship are spaceships which keep moving across the cells in each level The pulsar is the most common repeat that has 3 parts Most of the repeating patterns have 2 parts like the blinker and toad 

Since the Game of Life was made some people play with new rules These rules are usually more ways to make cells alive or dead or they are more rules to make it harder for cells to switch

Some variations change the way the cells look or where they are put 

When people play the Game of Life with two players the alive cells have two colours and a player wins when their colors take up all of the cells When a dead cell becomes alive its color is the same as the as the alive cells that touch it If both colors are touching the new alive cell then the color that touches it more wins

The Unification Church is a new religious movement based on the importance of the family in creating a world of peace started by Sun Myung Moon in Korea in the 1940s It officially began as a church in 1954 in Seoul South Korea On October 12 2009 it was announced that Sun Myung Moon was given the church to his sons Moon Hyung jin Moon Kook jin and Moon Hyun jin

Critics of the Unification Church have accused the organization of being closely involved with covert CIA authored operations against communism in Korea during the 1960s The Church is known to have been involved with weapon and munitions manufacturing in Korea since the 1960s as documented in a 1978 United States Congressional Report on the Unification Church The explanation given by Korean Unification Church members is that all manufacturers seeking to do business in South Korea were required to supply the military

Sun Myung Moons controversial religious and political Unification Movement which includes not only the Unification Church but an enormous constellation of civic organizations including the Washington Times Foundation is allied politically with evangelical Christians such as Jerry Falwell and Tim LaHaye Advocates adhering to this point of view have challenged the churchs tax exempt status in the US arguing that the political activities of church related groups comprise an impermissible intrusion of the church into political areas

Authorities in Brazil and Paraguay have expressed concerns over the Churchs purchases in recent years of large tracts of land in South America ranging in the hundreds of thousands of acres

In May 2002 federal police in Brazil conducted a number of raids on organizations linked to Sun Myung Moon In a statement the police stated that the raids were part of a broad investigation into allegations of tax evasion and immigration violations by Moons organization The Association of Families for Unification and World Peace was the target of the raids which took place in Rio de Janeiro So Paulo and the personal residence of Moons primary representative in Brazil Reverend Kim Yoon sang As of 2008 no legal action has been taken by the Brazilian government resulting from their investigations

On 15 September 2010 Pullman along with 54 other public figures signed an open letter published in The Guardian newspaper stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI being given the honour of a state visit to the UK arguing that he has led and condoned global abuses of human rights The letter says The state of which the pope is head has also resisted signing many major human rights treaties and has formed its own treaties with many states which negatively affect the human rights of citizens of those states Co signees included Stephen Fry Professor Richard Dawkins Terry Pratchett Jonathan Miller and Ken Follet

Yomi the Japanese word for the underworld in which horrible creatures guard the exits According to Shinto mythology as related in Kojiki this is where the dead go to exist and rot forever When one eats at the hearth of Yomi it is impossible to return to the land of the living Yomi is similar to Hades or Hell In the Shintoist tradition Yomi is known because Izanami retreated to that place after her death Izanagi followed her there and when he returned he washed himself creating Amaterasu Susanoo and Tsukuyomi

Yomi is different from Christian Hell in that all souls go there no matter their actions in life and one does not receive punishment for evils made when alive It is a dirty and polluted place In Japanese tradition pollution is usually associated to evil By the tradition of Kojiki Yomi is usually believed to be underground and its entrance to be located in Izumo province

Yomi is ruled over by Izanami no Mikoto the Grand Deity of Yomi According to Kojiki The entrance to Yomi was blocked by Izanagi when he returned to Earth using a great boulder at the base of the slope that leads to Yomi

Ryjin was the god of the sea in Japanese mythology He was a dragon a symbol of the power of the ocean had a very big mouth and could transform into human shape Ryjin lived in Ryg j his palace under the sea built out of red and white coral from where he controlled the tides with magical tide jewels Sea turtles fish and jellyfish were Ryjins servants

Ryjin was the father of the beautiful goddess Otohime who married the hunter prince Hoori The first Emperor of Japan Emperor Jimmu is said to have been a grandson of Otohime and Hooris This means Ryjin is believed to be one of the ancestors of the Japanese imperial dynasty

A legend about Ryjin is the story about how the jellyfish lost its bones This story tells that once Ryjin wanted to eat monkeys liver and sent the jellyfish to get him a monkey The monkey managed to escape from the jellyfish by telling him that he had put his liver in a jar in the forest and offered to go and get it When the jellyfish came back and told Ryjin what had happened Ryjin became so angry that he beat the jellyfish until its bones were all broken

Gospel music is a style of music It is sort of telling a religious story through a song Gospel music is traditionally used to tell a religious background of an individual Gospel music is often written to express personal or communal belief regarding Christianity or to give an alternative to classical Christian music This music is used to praise worship and thank God Christ or the Holy Spirit

Salsa is a type of music and dance of hispanic origin Salsa music is based on Cuban music This is a fusion of musical ideas which originally came from Africa and Spain

During 1965 1975 in New York musicians of Cuban and Puerto Rican origin combined to produce this Cuban style music The music got the label of salsa No one really knows how this happened but everyone recognised how good it was to have a label for it Over time salsa bands worked in other influences For example in the late 60s Willie Colon developed numbers that made use of Brazilian rhythms NY radio programmes offered salsarengue as a further combination

The question of whether or not salsa is anything more than Cuban music has been argued over for more than thirty years Initially not much difference could be heard Later it became clear that salsa in New York was a bit different from popular music in Cuba Also Miami Venezuela Colombia and other places all had their own ideas It now seems clear that salsa has receded from the great position it achieved in the late 1970s at any rate in New York The reasons for this are also much disputed It is difficult for any music which uses a foreign language to succeed in the biggest English speaking market place

Salsa as a dance can be seen in all the places mentioned Unlike standard ballroom dancing there is no clear agreement on how it should be danced and the methods differ widely in detail The teaching of salsa is also rather undeveloped But as a general guide salsa dancing is rather like other dances from Cuba such as the cha cha cha

Amaterasus brother the storm god Susanoo had vandalised her sacred buildings and killed her broken wikt linkmaidenmaidens because she refused to trust him Amaterasu became so scared of his wrath that she went to hide into a cave Ame no Iwato The world without the light of the sun became dark The Oni came out to the dark world and the gods could not make Amaterasu come out of the cave

The intelligent Uzume took a small boat turned it upside down near the cave entrance and began a dance on it tearing off her clothing in front of the other Kami They thought this was so funny that they laughed happily

Amaterasu heard them and looked out to see why the gods were laughing When she opened the cave she saw her wonderful reflection in a mirror Uzume had put on a tree and slowly came out of the cave

At that moment the god Ameno Tajikarawo closed the cave behind her so she could not go back in Another god tied a magic rope across the entrance The sun goddess was then asked by the Kami Ame no Koyane to go back with the gods She agreed and light came back to the earth

Amaterasu later was made to come out of the cave but Susanoo was punished by being banished from Heaven He came down to the province of Izumo where he met an old couple Seven of their eight daughters had been eaten by the eight headed serpent Yamata no Orochi and it was about to come for the eighth Kushi inada hime After the couple promised their daughters hand in marriage to Susanoo he agreed to kill Orochi With the help of eight bowls of sake Susanoo cut the head off the monster when it was sleeping

Kaspar Hauser was a child who lived in Germany His early life is a mystery Kaspar appeared in the street in 1828 not able to talk normally and no one knew where he had come from

On May 26 1828 the boy who became known as Kaspar Hauser was found in the streets of Nuremberg Germany He was dressed like a simple country person and could hardly talk He carried with him two letters One letter seems to have been written by a poor workman and it was addressed to a captain in the army The writer of the letter says that he had looked after the boy since 1812 and that the boy wants to serve the king in the army He asks the captain to take the boy or to hang him There is no date on the letter The other letter looked as if it was from his mother to the poor workman who had been looking after him It says that the child was born on April 30th 1812 and that he was called Kaspar but that he has no second name It says that his father was a soldier and that the boy should become a soldier when he is 17 The mother writes that she herself is too poor to look after him

The boy was taken to an army captain whose name was Wessenig The only things Kaspar could say were I want to be a knight as my father was and Horse Horse The captain asked him lots of other questions but the boy only cried and said Dont know He was taken to a police station where he could only write his name Kaspar Hauser

He spent the next two months in a tower where a broken wikt linkjailorjailor looked after him Many people came to see him He smiled and he walked like a baby He was probably 16 years old but his thinking was like a small child and he would only drink water and eat bread

It took a long time but Kaspar was taught to speak and slowly told people about his life He said that he had spent his life locked up in a small room with only a straw bed to sleep in and a wooden horse to play with He was only given bread and water Sometimes the water tasted strange because it had something inside that made him go to sleep When he woke up from such a sleep he found that his hair and fingernails had been cut Later he was visited by a man who never showed his face The man taught him to speak a little bit and then let him go Kaspar walked down the streets of Nuremburg and then fainted 

People in many countries heard about the mysterious boy and tried to find out who he was Some people thought he was related to the Grand Duke of Baden Some people thought it was all a big joke

Hauser was then taken into care by a schoolteacher Friedrich Daumer who taught him to speak read and write Kaspar learned quickly

On October 17 1829 a hooded man tried to kill Hauser with a large knife but managed only to wound his forehead People were worried that the person might try to kill him again so he was given to someone else to be looked after He was given a job as a broken wikt linkcopyistcopyist Because someone had tried to murder him some people thought it proved that he was related to a noble family in the house of Baden

A British nobleman Lord Stanhope was interested in Hauser and gave him presents and tried to get permission to look after him He said that Hauser was Hungarian and not of noble blood Many historians thought that Lord Stanhope himself might have been from the house of Baden and that was why he was interested in Kaspar

On 14 December 1833 Hauser was told to go to a garden where he would find out about the family he came from When he got there he was attacked by a stranger who stabbed him in the chest He managed to get home but died three days later No one knew who had murdered him although a strange note was found in a black broken wikt linkpursepurse saying that Kaspar would not be able to tell people who had killed him but that he was from the Bavarian border and that his initials were ML  No one ever found out who the murderer was and no one ever found out who Kaspar was

The story of Kaspar Hauser has been made into films both in German and in English Books have been written about him and lots of people have made guesses about who he might have been Some people have even guessed that he was just pretending but it seems unlikely that he could have kept that up for several years

Flavius Romulus Augustus often called Romulus Augustulus was a Western Roman Emperor He reigned from 31 October 475 to 4 September 476 The end of his rule is considered to be the end of the western part of the Roman Empire

Justinian I or Justinian the Great was Eastern Roman Emperor from 527 until his death He is considered a saint by Eastern Orthodox Christians

Justinian simplified Roman laws These are now called Corpus Juris Civilis

Diocletian was Roman Emperor from 20 November 284 to 11 May 305 Diocletian ended the period known as the Crisis of the Third Century He worked to return Rome to its former glory by making changes in key areas

Religion He persecuted Christians crucifying more than any other emperor and imposed the traditional polytheistic religion of the Romans

Economy Recognizing a gold drain from the western Mediterranean to the east he tried to stop the inflation of the region by legislation He decreed that coins could only be made of gold or silver stopping the trend of using lead in their creation

Military Diocletian changed the army from the traditional garrison defense to one that placed small ouposts of soldiers permanently at the border He recurited local soldiers from the border regions along the Rhine and Danube rivers These soldiers farmed and lived with their families in a village atmosphere and lit signal fires on signal towers to warn other outposts of possible incursion of Germanics from across the border The received regular pay from Rome for their services He allowed soldiers to move up through the ranks by the accrual of military credits earned by years of loyal service and by distinguishing ones self on the field of battle

 Political structure  Diocletian established a form of government known as the tetrarchy In this the Empire was organised into four parts each ruled by a co emperor Diocletian took charge of the eastern empire The senior co emperor was Maximian Augustus a fellow officer He took charge of the western empire Later two junior co emperors were added Galerius and Constantius Chlorus 

Finally in 305 the two senior emperors abdicated and retired and the two juniors rose to the rank of Augustus They in turn were supported by two juniors Severus II in the west under Constantius and Maximinus in the east under Galerius In this way the Tetrarchy showed how it could reproduce itself

These men were from the Roman province of Illyria several in the city of Sirmium which would become one of the four capitals under this system From the time of Domitian when over half the Roman army was deployed in the Danubian regions the Illyrian provinces had been the most important recruiting ground of the auxilia and later the legions 

In the 3rd century Romanised Illyrians came to dominate the armys senior officer echelons Ultimately the Illyrian officer class seized control of the state itself 

The four Tetrarchs based themselves not at Rome but in other cities closer to the frontiers mainly intended as headquarters for the defence of the empire against bordering rivals and barbarians at the Rhine and Danube These centres are known as the Tetrarchic capitals 

Although Rome ceased to be the operational capital it was still the nominal capital of the entire empire It had its own Prefect of the City an idea later copied in Constantinople

The four Tetrarchic capitals were

Aquileia a port on the Adriatic coast and Eboracum were also significant centres for Maximian and Constantius respectively

In terms of regional jurisdiction there was no precise division between the four Tetrarchs and this period did not see the Roman state actually split up into four distinct sub empires Each emperor had his zone of influence within the Roman Empire but little more mainly high command in a war theatre Each Tetrarch was himself often in the field while delegating most of the administration to the hierarchic bureaucracy headed by his respective Praetorian Prefect each supervising several Vicarii the governors general in charge of another lasting new administrative level the civil diocese For a listing of the provinces now known as eparchy within each quarter see Roman province

In the West the Augustus Maximian controlled the provinces west of the Adriatic Sea and the Syrtis and within that region his Caesar Constantius controlled Gaul and Britain In the East the arrangements between the Augustus Diocletian and his Caesar Galerius were much more flexible

Diocletians reforms fundamentally changed the structure of Roman imperial government and stabilized the empire economically and militarily This helped the empire to remain intact for another hundred years despite having seemed near the brink of collapse in Diocletians youth 

Weakened by illness Diocletian left the imperial office on 1 May 305 and became the first Roman emperor to voluntarily abdicate the position He lived out his retirement in his palace on the Dalmatian coast tending to his vegetable gardens His palace eventually became the core of the modern day city of Split

Maximian attempted to return to power Diocletian ordered him to step down permanently Finally Maximian was forced to commit suicide and the tetrarchy began to unravel Diocletian died in despair

Trajan was Roman Emperor from 98 to 117 Born into a non patrician family in the province of Hispania Baetica Trajan rose to prominence during the reign of emperor Domitian 

Serving as a general in the Roman army along the German frontier Trajan successfully put down the revolt of Antonius Saturninus in 89 

In September 96 Domitian was succeeded by Nerva an old and childless senator who proved to be unpopular with the army After a brief and tumultuous year in power a revolt by members of the Praetorian Guard compelled him to adopt the more popular Trajan as his heir and successor Nerva died on 27 January 98 and was succeeded by Trajan without incident

As a civilian administrator Trajan is best known for his extensive public building program which reshaped the city of Rome and left multiple enduring landmarks such as Trajans Forum Trajans Market and Trajans Column 

Early in his reign he annexed Nabataea creating the province of Arabia Petraea His conquest of Dacia enriched the empire greatly  the new province possessed many valuable gold mines His war against the Parthian Empire ended with the sack of its capital Ctesiphon and the annexation of Armenia and Mesopotamia His campaigns expanded the Roman Empire to its greatest territorial extent 

In late 117 while sailing back to Rome Trajan fell ill and died of a stroke in the city of Selinus He was deified by the Senate and succeeded by his adopted son Hadrian

As an emperor Trajans reputation has endured he is one of the few rulers whose reputation has survived nineteen centuries Every new emperor after him was honoured by the Senate with the prayer felicior Augusto melior Traiano meaning may he be luckier than Augustus and better than Trajan Among medieval Christian theologians Trajan was considered a virtuous pagan while the 18th century historian Edward Gibbon popularized the notion of the Five Good Emperors of which Trajan was the second

A fluorescent lamp is a type of lamp that uses ultraviolet emitted by mercury vapor to excite a phosphor which emits visible light There are two general types traditional fluorescent and compact fluorescent This article is about traditional fluorescent lamps

The purchase price of a fluorescent lamp is often much higher than an incandescent lamp of the same output and the light from fluorescent lamps looks different to light from incandescent lamps Fluorescent lamps have a longer rated life and use less energy than an incandescent lamp of the same brightness A fluorescent lamp can save over US30 in electricity costs over the lamps lifetime compared to an incandescent lamp

An electric current is applied to mercury vapor inside the tube causing it to emit ultraviolet light A phosphor on the walls of the tube absorbs the ultraviolet light This causes an electron to jump up to an orbital with a higher energy When the electron drops back down to its normal orbital the phosphor re emits its energy as visible light

The ballast prevents too much electricity from flowing through the tube It also starts the lamp with a high voltage for a split second when it is switched on The ballast is located inside the fixture in traditional fluorescent fixtures There are two types of ballasts magnetic and electronic Magnetic ballasts have mostly fallen out of use as they are less efficient than electronic ballasts they cause the bulb to flicker and they do not start instantly Electronic ballasts were at one time more expensive than magnetic ballasts but now the price is about the same

The average rated life of a fluorescent light bulb is 8 to 15 times longer that of incandescents Fluorescent light bulb typically have a rated lifespan of 6000 to 15000 hours whereas incandescent lamps are usually manufactured to have a lifespan of 750 hours or 1000 hours

The lifetime of any lamp depends on many factors including operating voltage manufacturing defects exposure to voltage spikes mechanical shock frequency of cycling on and off lamp orientation and ambient operating temperature The life of a fluorescent lamp is significantly shorter if it is turned on and off frequently In the case of a 5 minute onoff cycle the lifespan of a fluorescent lamp can be reduced to close to that of incandescent light bulbs The US Energy Star program suggests that fluorescent lamps be left on when leaving a room for less than 15 minutes to avoid this problem If the light must be switched on and off frequently Cold cathode fluorescent lamps can be used Cold cathode fluorescent lamps are designed for many more onoff cycles than standard lamps

The mercury inside the tube is toxic and makes these bulbs hazardous waste The bulbs must be taken to a recycling center after they stop working During normal use the mercury cannot escape although it will escape if the bulb is broken If a single bulb breaks it is not usually a cause for concern It is recommended to open windows to air out the room and to clean up broken glass with duct tape instead of a vacuum cleaner

Tropical Storm Chantal was a very short lived storm in the northern Atlantic Ocean that stayed away from land during most of its existence It was also the third named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season The stormed formed from a non tropical system between Bermuda on Cape Cod Massachusetts that developed on July 31 with good conditions for further development The storm had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and began to move quickly northeastwards into colder water temperatures When convection began to decrease the National Hurricane Center stopped sending out advisories on August 1 when Chantal began to turn into an extratropical cyclone Later the remnants moved over southeast Newfoundland before moving into the Arctic Ocean

An area of thunderstorm activity developed on July 28 about 100 miles east of the Bahamas which was associated with a weak low pressure system It moved north northeastward into poor environmental conditions which left the system disorganized However conditions then were forecasted to become better for development and by July 29 the National Hurricane Center stated that it had potential for tropical or subtropical development On July 30 the low passed to the west of Bermuda as it continued moving northeastward under the effects of a large mid latitude trough The system contained an exposed low level circulation which from time to time passed under a thick area of convection to its northeast By early on July 31 ship reports and QuikSCAT observations detected winds of 35 mph and the center was well involved enough with the convection for the National Hurricane Center to name it as Tropical Depression Three while it was located about 270 miles north northwest of Bermuda or about 445 miles south southeast of Chatham Massachusetts

By six hours after development the depression had of a somewhat exposed low level center with deep convection taking up most of the northeastern semicircle Located over sea surface temperatures of about 80 F one forecaster said the depression had a small window of opportunity for it to reach tropical storm strength before transitioning to an extratropical cyclone The system organized further and based on satellite pictures and QuikSCAT data the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Chantal at 1215 UTC on July 31 while located about 330 miles south of Halifax Nova Scotia By three hours later the system formed a well defined curved banding features and Chantal reached maximum systained winds of 50 mph at 402 N The storm speed up northeastward into an area of cold waters and cooler air and early on August 1 the National Hurricane Center gave out its last advisory on Chantal as it began extratropical transition

After becoming an extratropical cyclone Chantal managed to keep scattered convection near its center though its main area of convection and clouds moved to its north On August 1 the cyclone made landfall on Newfoundland along the Avalon Peninsula and by late in the day the extratropical remnants of Chantal were about 265 miles northeast of St Johns Newfoundland and Labrador and moving northeastward at 44 mph

The weather system that would later become Chantal began to affect Bermuda on July 30 It caused some thunderstorms The next day it caused heavy rainfall that reached r212 inches at the Bermuda International Airport Winds on the island reached 45 mph because of the weather system After Chantal passed Bermuda a ship with the call sign of C60Y4 recorded winds of 37 mph

Shortly after the system became a tropical storm the Atlantic Storm Prediction Center of Canada sent out gale warnings for the waters off of Newfoundland The Newfoundland Labrador Weather Office also issued warnings for heavy rain 

In the open ocean waves from Chantal reached 20 feet high The storm also had effects on land A wind gust of 54 mph was reported What was left of Chantal caused heavy rainfall in a short time in Newfoundland In the province rainfall peaked at 59 inches at Whitbourne The rainfall caused flooding and also caused streets to wash out in several cities on the Avalon Peninsula Several towns declared states of emergencies along the Avalon Peninsula

Flinders Street Station is the central railway station of the rail network of Melbourne Australia It is on the corner of Flinders and Swanston Streets next to the Yarra River in the middle of the city stretching from Swanston Street to Queen Street and covering two city blocks Each weekday about 105000 people and 1500 trains use the station

It is serviced by Metros suburban and city loop services and VLines regional services

The first railway station in the Flinders Street site was called Melbourne or City Terminus and was a collection of sheds It was completed in 1854 and was officially opened on 12 September by Sir Charles Hotham The terminus was the first city railway station in Australia and the opening day saw the first steam train trip in the country It travelled to Sandridge over the Sandridge Bridge travelling along the now light rail Port Melbourne line

Melbournes two other early central city stations Spencer Street Station and Princes Bridge opened in 1859 Princes Bridge was originally separated from Flinders Street even though it was only on the opposite side of Swanston Street Once the railway line was extended under the street to join the two Princes Bridge slowly became amalgamated into Flinders Street Federation Square now occupies its site

In 1882 the government decided to build a new central passenger station to replace the existing construction A worldwide design competition was held in 1899 with 17 entries received The 500 first prize went to railway employees J W Fawcett and H P C Ashworth whose design included a giant dome and clock tower Work began in 1901 and ended in 1910

Flinders Street Stations platforms are numbered from north to south with Platform No 1 being the farthest north and generally serve specific lines as follows

Platform 1 Epping and Hurstbridge

Platforms 2 3 Belgrave Glen Waverley and Lilydale

Platforms 4 5 Alamein Blackburn trains on the Belgrave and Lilydale lines Cragieburn Sydenham Upfield and Werribee

Platforms 6 7 Cranbourne Frankston and Pakenham 

Platforms 8 9 Sandringham and Williamstown

Platforms 10 1214 Various services depending on day and time

Note that the eastern end of Platform No 1 is designated as Platform No 14 past the Platform 1 escalators Platform 11 is out of use and has no track

Flinders Street is currently undergoing redevelopment It will involve cleaning and repair as well as improving general ability for people who are disabled to move around the station

The band named the album Riot because they liked the definition A sudden outburst of uncontrolled emotion

The name Paramore is an alternative spelling of Paramour means secret lover or the archaic word for beloved 

Paramore were originally formed in 2004 in Franklin Tennessee United States by vocalist Hayley Williams lead guitarist Josh Farro drummer Zac Farro and bassist Jeremy Davis with the later addition of rhythm guitarist Jason Bynum The name Paramore came from the name of their first bassists mother Then when they know the meaning of the word paramour that means secret lover they decided to use the name under Paramore spelling

Stonemasonry is the craft of making things out of stone People who do this are called stonemasons Their crafts have existed since the start of civilization They have made important buildings and structures out of stone This stone comes from the earth Stone has been used to build many long lasting things These could be monuments artifacts cathedrals and cities These can often be seen in many cultures Some monuments made out of stone include the Egyptian pyramids and the Greek Parthenon Stonehenge is also a famous stone building

Very often articles are about people or things with names in a language other than English This page explains how to name such articles 

Special characters are sometimes used in languages other than English These special characters may be there to describe sounds of that specific language They can also be there to help pronunciation For example Spanish uses diacritics to put stress on a certain part of a word and to do a few other things In Spanish writing words that are stressed differently usually need accent marks to show where they are stressed In English such marks are often picked up from the foreign language but not always

There are also ideas like the International Phonetic Alphabet that have been created to help people correctly pronounce and stress words from any language in the world

Many people will have problems entering special characters Special characters need to be composed on many keyboards This means that several keys need to be pressed to get the character This is of course not as fast and easy as just pressing one key 

For some special characters there are replacements For example the German letter can also be written as oe can be written as ue can be written as ae and can be written as sz or ss Not all languages special characters have such replacements For this reason redirects should be made from all other forms and spellings of the word to the actual article name

As a general guideline the most common name used in English should be used to name an article on the Simple English Wikipedia With places this is often the same as the name in the places native language but not always A good way to guess what form is used most often in English is by using the tools at httpgooglecom advanced search For names without many mentions on the internet doing this may not always give the right answer so some common sense is needed 

When a place has more than one name the English form of the name used today if there is one should be used English names that are not in more common usage today should not be used For example Ivory Coast is an English translation of Cte dIvoire and is still seen quite often but evidence has shown that Cte dIvoire is nowadays used more often in English than the older term Because Cte dIvoire has become more common in English we have the redirect going from Ivory Coast to Cte dIvoire

For another example the German city known in German as Kln can be found here at its most common English name Cologne There is a redirect from Kln to Cologne The Polish city Szczecin has a redirect from its German name Stettin because this is also a commonly seen form of the name but not as common in todays English as Szczecin

Some languages use alphabets other than the Latin one Examples of such are the Cyrillic alphabet or the Chinese or Arabic language characters For such languages there is usually at least one rule for how to write them with Latin characters This is called transliteration

This should be done to explain foreign characters in the first sentence of the article but it will not always be the name of the article especially if the place has an English language name that is easier to use For example the capital of the Peoples Republic of China can be found at Beijing which happens to be the same as the pinyin transliteration of the Chinese name But the capital of Russia can be found at its usual English name Moscow rather than the transliteration of the Russian one

Redirects should always be from the less common name to the more common one used in English

If the pronunciation of a place is different to what a native English speaker expects pronunciation help should be provided in the articles first sentence not in the article title This can either be with phonetic transliteration or by giving a sound sample of how the name is pronounced Note that sound files like all files should be uploaded to our sister project Wikimedia Commons

During the war in 1942 Karajan married Anita Gtermann She was the daughter of a rich man who had a business making sewing machines His wife was partly Jewish This caused the Nazis to talk about whether Karajan should still be allowed to conduct By 1944 he was not in favour with the Nazis but he was still conducting in Berlin He left Berlin and went to Milan Italy with his wife in February 1945 Karajan divorced Anita in 1958

He very often conducted the Vienna Philharmonic and gave many concerts at the Salzburg Festival He continued to work very hard performing conducting and recording until his death in 1989 In Karajans last years he left the Berlin Philharmonic after arguments with them and concentrated on working again with the Vienna State Opera and the Vienna Philharmonic

Herbert von Karajan had very good musicianship and memory He conducted without a score in front of him very often with his eyes closed He is remembered for being very strict and always insisting on having things the way he wanted There are many stories about him that show this He insisted on being paid very high fees When he was being filmed conducting an orchestra he wanted the cameras to show him all the time When he conducted Wagner at the Metropolitan Opera he made the stand for the conductor higher so that the audience could see him

Gladiators were professional fighters in ancient Rome who fought against each other wild animals and sentenced criminals sometimes to the death for the entertainment of the public These fights took place in arenas in many cities from the Roman Republic period through the Roman Empire

The word comes from gladius the Latin word for a short sword used by legionaries and some gladiators 

There were different types of gladiators in the world such as Thracians Mirmillones Retiarii and the Secutores

Kamikaze is a word of Japanese origin It comes from the name the Japanese gave to a typhoon that destroyed the Mongol ships in the 13th century and saved the country from invasion In Western culture the word kamikaze is used to mean the suicide pilots of the Empire of Japan and their attacks on the ships of the Allied Powers in the final years of World War II during which they flew their planes into enemy ships It has also come to mean other kinds of suicide attack

Most people in Western culture believe the word kamikaze was the name used by the Japanese military for pilots but that is not true Their correct name was tokubetsu kgeki tai which literally means special attack unit This is usually abbreviated tokktai in a shortened form The suicide attacks made by Navy pilots were called shinp tokubetsu kgeki tai The American translators used a different style of pronunciation of the Japanese language by mistake and read the word shinp as kamikaze The name became popular throughout the world and after the war the Japanese also started using it

A normal kamikaze strike consisted of 10 planes rigged to explode with more radius than normal planes This allowed them to blow more things upproofdateJanuary 2012

After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 1941 the Japanese Navy and Air force were defeated in several important battles like Midway and the Philippine Sea They lost many ships hundreds of fighter aircraft and many of their best pilots The Japanese industry had little resources and was very poor compared to the American industry For this reason the United States replaced their lost ships and planes with better ones very quickly but Japan could only make few and of poor quality During 1943 44 the Allied forces were moving towards Japan At the Battle of the Philippine Sea on June 19 20 1944 the Japanese forces were pushed back to the Philippines

On July 15 Saipan was captured by Allied forces The capture of Saipan made it possible for the US Air force to attack Japan itself using B 29 Superfortress bombers After the fall of Saipan the Japanese commanders knew that the Allies would try to capture the Philippines next The Philippines were very important because they were located between the oil fields of Southeast Asia and Japan If Japan lost control over the Philippines they would have little fuel left for their ships On October 17 the Allies started the attack on the Philippines in the Battle of Leyte Gulf

Vice Admiral Takijiro Onishi was in charge of the Japanese Air Force in Manila He understood that it was impossible to win the battle with so few aircraft and trained pilots For this reason he decided to form a suicide attack force the Special Attack Unit A group of 24 student pilots volunteered for the mission The Special Attack force was organized into 4 groups Unit Shikishima Unit Yamato Unit Asahi and Unit Yamazakura These names were taken from a patriotic poem written by the Japanese classical poet Motoori Norinaga Shikishima no Yamato gokoro wo hito towaba asahi ni niou yamazakura bana The poem reads

The Japanese were defeated at the battle of Leyte Gulf but the Special Attack force had great success The first kamikaze attack took place on October 21 1944 against the flagship of the Royal Australian Navy HMAS Australia 30 sailors died in the attack including its Captain Emile Dechaineux and many more were wounded By October 26 47 more Allied ships had been attacked Most of them were badly damaged or sunk like the United States aircraft carrier USS St Lo

This early success convinced the Japanese commanders to continue the kamikaze attacks Many more pilots were recruited to act as kamikaze Over the next few months more than 2000 planes made such attacks When the Japanese stock of airplanes began to run low new models of low quality were built for these missions Some of them like the Nakajima Ki 115 Tsurugi were made mostly of wood and used stocks of older engines The planes landing gear was usually dropped by the pilot after takeoff so it could be used by other aircraft because he would not be landing again Similar suicide attack programs were planned including rocket bombs with pilots and submarine torpedoes

The high point of kamikaze attacks came from April 6 to May 25 1945 during the Battle of Okinawa in Operation Kikusui In that time seven important waves of attacks took place with more than 1500 kamikaze planes Because their training had been too short and their airplanes were poorly made kamikaze pilots were easy targets for the experienced Allied pilots who also had much better planes But still the kamikaze who escaped the anti aircraft fire and the enemy fighter airplanes did great damage to the Allied fleet The Allies won the battle but they lost many ships and men because of kamikaze attacks By the end of the battle at least 21 American ships had been sunk by kamikazes Some ships from other Allied navies were also sunk and dozens more were damaged

Hundreds of extra kamikaze planes were ready to defend Japan from the final invasion However with Japans surrender on August 15 after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the declaration of war by the Soviet Union they were never used

The most important effect of the attacks was creating fear among the Allied troops When the American ships went to the last battles the crews were very afraid of kamikaze pilots By the end of World War II the Japanese Navy had sacrificed 2525 kamikaze pilots and the Air force had lost 1387 The Japanese government said the missions sank 81 ships and damaged 195 They also claimed that the kamikaze attacks were the cause of 80 of Allied deaths in the last years of the War

The American sources claim that kamikaze sunk less ships than the Japanese say But still they agree that they did very important damage According to a US Air Force source the kamikaze attackers sunk 34 Navy ships damaged 368 others killed 4900 sailors and wounded over 4800 In a 2004 book World War II the historians Wilmott Cross Messenger say that more than 70 US ships were sunk or damaged beyond repair by kamikazes

Many kamikaze pilots offered themselves as volunteers for the mission They were usually very young between 18 and 24 years old Their belief was that dying when striking the enemies of Japan and the Emperor down was a very honorable death This principle was traditional since the days of the samurai and gave great importance to the sense of duty and obedience This idea was called Giri and was part of the code of conduct of the Japanese warriors since the Middle Ages the Bushido Many young men sacrificed themselves by their free will because these beliefs and their love for the home land were the most important things for them The tokktai pilots manual told pilots to never close their eyes This was because if a pilot closed his eyes he would miss his target In the final moments before the crash the pilot was to shout Hissatsu as loud as he could

However many others did so because of social pressure Not offering oneself as a volunteer was a sign of cowardice and dishonor Several professional pilots who were ordered to do suicide attacks did it because of military obedience not because of honor One of the first kamikaze pilots Lieutenant Yukio Seki wrote after nearly being forced to volunteer

A special ceremony before going to combat usually took place Pilots drank sake and ate a ball of rice They were given medals and a katana sword They put on a headband with the rising sun and a sennibari a belt of a thousand stitches made by a thousand women who made one stitch each Many times they took prayers written by their families with them According to legend young pilots on kamikaze missions many times flew southwest from Japan over the 922 metre Mount Kaimon Suicide mission pilots looked over their shoulders to see this and said farewell to their country Another legend says that kamikaze pilots dropped flowers from the air as they departed on their final missions Some places like the hills near Kikajima airport are said to have beds of cornflower that bloom in early May from those days

Some important military men who survived the war criticized the kamikaze plan years after Saburo Sakai a war time ace pilot said

The Age of Enlightenment was an 18th century cultural movement in Europe It had its center in France and there it was led by philosophers like Descartes and Denis Diderot Diderot spread the enlightenments ideas with the Encyclopdie the first big public book of reference

The most important idea of the Enlightenment was the belief in peoples reason All people are capable of thinking for themselves Therefore a person should not automatically believe in things those in power and other authorities claim People do not even have to believe what the church teaches or what the priests preach Another important thought was that a society is best developed when all its members regardless of status collaborated equally in its design It was thought therefore that the special rights and privileges of the nobility should be abolished These were dangerous thoughts for those in power and many enlightenment philosophers were at times imprisoned or were forced into exile 

The ideas of the Age of Enlightenment contributed to the French revolution of 1789 Some people in power from different countries took some of the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment and made changes to their countries although they kept power for themselves Examples of these so called enlightened absolutists include Catherine the Great of Russia Frederick the Great of Prussia and Gustav III of Sweden

During this period of time the Enlightenment as more and more people began to use reason some came to disagree with the idea that God created the world This brought on conflicts and later war The Enlightenment is held to be the source of important ideas such as the centrality of freedom democracy and reason as primary values in society The enlightened argued that the establishment of a contractual basis of rights would lead to the capitalism the use of scientific method to religious tolerance and to the organization of states into self governing republics held together through democratic means The application of rationality to every problem is considered the essential change From this point on thinkers and writers were held to be free to pursue the truth in whatever form even if the pursuit of truth or the new truth violated established ideas 

The Enlightenment also had an effect on many of the founding fathers of America They were influenced by the Enlightenments idea of duty and of the role of government for the people

The Enlightenment was different from its earlier movement the Renaissance Renaissance figures helped the rise of arts by using religion During the Enlightenment its figures started thinking with reason and natural science Lots of them also gave the Catholic Church severe attacks The movement gave rise to Capitalism and Socialism 

It was followed by the 19th century Romanticism movement and the 20th century Existentialist movement

A hawk is a bird of prey The name can mean a different species such as

The Hawks scientific name is Buteo jamaicensis The genus Buteo is from the Latin buteo The specific name jamaicensis is named for Jamaica the country and from the Latin ensis This refers to the range of the hawk extending from Alaska to the West Indies The Hawk is a bird of prey and those types of birds are called raptors The young ones when they have their first complete plumage are called immature

Their length is 17 to 22 inches with an average of 19 inches Their wingspread depending on the species ranges from 43 to 56 inches Their weight ranges from 15 to 33 pounds averaging 24 pounds

Adults are typically dark brown and the immature ones are gray brown There are five different species of Hawks in the United States and several more around the world Their colors vary slightly They have a quite noticeable shade of red on their tail end A few species are black but it is rare

Hawks are a very common type of bird that can be found in every habitat in North America except in the high arctic and in extensive tracts of dense forests The ones that live in the far north migrate south in autumn They can get down all the way to Mexico and South America They do not stay in the snow and ice They return in the spring which is the breeding season Hawks live in both open and wooded areas particularly wood edges They are often seen perched conspicuously on a treetop

Hawks start breeding when they are one year old The breeding season is in the spring and the eggs are laid six to eight weeks later The mother keeps the eggs warm for about a month before they are born in the late spring There are normally three eggs in a nest Weasels sometimes attack the nest killing andor eating the nestling

Flight Active flight is with slow steady and deep wing beats Hawks soar with wings raised slightly above horizontal They hover and kite on moderate wind

While still young and living in the nest hawks will eat worms and beetles They will also eat frogs mice and snakes As they get older hawks prey mainly on rodents but also on insects and their larvae fish and larger mammals such rabbits hares and squirrels They will also eat carrion

If a hawk finishes a meal with their crop bulging it may not hunt again for a day or two The crop is a pouch halfway between the mouth and the stomach where food is stored and gradually released to the stomach The crop maintains the steady flow of food needed to sustain these big birds

One assumption made is that each hawk eats three squirrels per year that is it needs at least three to survive This is a BIG assumption because hawks eat many other things and if they do not find food in an area they move until they find it It is also interesting to know that hawks might attack and kill a squirrel but only eat small portions of it The three squirrels per year assumption was added to have a strong relationship and dependency between the two species In reality there is a relationship but it is much more complex that involves many more species

They have few if any natural predators but they have enemies such as pollution particularly from pesticides and habitat destruction from developments In short humans are their main predators

Birds of prey are birds that mainly use their claws to hunt for food They cannot be classified into one natural family or group The behaviour showed multiple times in different groups This is known as convergent evolution

Those bird of prey that are active during the day are classified as follows

Nocturnal birds of prey the owls are classified separately considered to be members of two families of the order Strigiformes

The vultures are usually also regarded as birds of prey although they may not be closely related to the other groups The Eastern vultures and the western New World vultures are two groups which have evolved separately Their similarities are due to convergent evolution

Jeffrey Buttle is a figure skater from Canada He has won the national championships for Canada three times and won the bronze medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics He has twice won the Four Continents Figure Skating Championships a competition for skaters from countries that are not in Europe

Buttle is known for his high level skating skills He has deep edges in his skating making his skating fun to watch even when he does not perform any jumps He is known for his spread eagle and his Ina Bauer

Other websites 

An Ina Bauer is a figure skating element It is named after a figure skater from Germany named Ina Bauer who invented the position

The Ina Bauer is performed by placing the feet in the fourth position in ballet The front leg is bent forwards at the knee and the back leg is extended behind the skater The front leg can be either on an inside edge or an outside edge An outside edge Ina Bauer is harder to do While the skater skates in a curve across the ice the back can be bent backwards This is not mandatory but it does add to the element

Shawn Sawyer is a Canadian figure skater He won the bronze medal two times at the Canadian national championships He skated at the 2006 Winter Olympics and came in 12th 

Unlike most figure skaters who spin on the ice and during their jumps in a counter clockwise motion Sawyer is one of few skaters who jumps and spins in a clockwise direction Other skaters who rotate lefty are Johnny Weir and Alissa Czisny

Sawyer is known for his great flexibility and his artistry on the ice Most male skaters do not perform spirals during competition because they do not get credit for doing them Sawyer uses them to highlight his skating and as difficulty entrances They are also a major part of his non competitive programs Sawyers spirals and flexible spins have given him a different look from most other skaters and have helped his popularity

Sawyer is often compared to Canadian Olympic bronze medalist Toller Cranston When Sawyer was 12 Cranston was about to retire from show skating Cranston put together a televised show in which he and other top ranked skaters including Scott Hamilton skated with Sawyer and gave him advice Cranston still advises Sawyer

Sawyer can perform a backflip on ice He was taught this move by Brian Orser

In 1998 an ex boyfriend of Orser announced in a court of law that Orser was gay Orser did not want this known at first He thought that people knowing that he was gay would affect his career in a negative way However he has since embraced being outed

It was invented by Werner Groebli better known as Mr Frick a long time show skater with Ice Follies It was brought back and popularized by Ilia Klimkin of Russia who performed it a lot in competition over many years

Mao Asada is a figure skater from Japan She is a former World Figure Skating Champion and is ranked no 3 by ISU She won the Japanese national championships in 2007 and 2008 after winning two silver medals in a row She is the 2005 World Junior Champion She won the silver medal at the 2010 Winter Olympics Her older sister Mai Asada is also a high level skater

Asada was a child prodigy She landed her first triple axel in competition while still at the junior level She is one of five female figure skaters who have ever landed that jump in international competition

Asada won won everything on the Junior level in the 2004 2005 season The next season was the Olympic season Asada would be too young to compete at the 2006 Olympics But the Japanese skating federation thought there was not a good reason to keep her at the Junior level when she had already won everything Asada was old enough for the Grand Prix but not for senior level ISU championships Asada went into the Grand Prix without any of the pressure that was on the other skaters who were old enough to go the Olympics and were trying to qualify for spots on their countrys Olympic team Able to compete without pressure Asada won the Grand Prix Final in December 2005

Following her win the Japanese skating federation petitioned the International Olympic Committee to make an exception to the age rule for Asada claiming that depriving her of a chance to compete at the 2006 Olympics would be denying a medal contender a chance to compete However this petition even if it had worked would have been too late Other skaters had been effected by the age rule The South Korean skating federation for example held Kim Yu Na back in juniors for the 2005 2006 season even though she could have competed successfully on the Grand Prix because she also was not old enough for the Olympics and because of it did not earn a spot to the Olympics at the Olympic Qualifying Competition in the fall of 2005 Asada had been a force in Japanese skating for many years so the federation could have petitioned for an exception years earlier There had previously been a loophole in eligibility rules regarding the World Championships and medalling at the World Junior Championships but that loophole had been closed years earlier and it had never applied to the Olympics

Instead Asada went to the World Junior Championships again where she lost to Kim Yu Na

In 2006 2007 Asadas first season being old enough for senior Worlds she won the silver medal at the World Championships behind fellow Japanese skater Miki Ando

Mao Asada is known for her amazing flexibility She is known for her one handed Biellmann spin and her cross grab Biellmann spiral in which she uses the hand opposite her leg to hold up her leg in the position She is consistent with the triple axel

Parsifal is an opera in three acts by Richard Wagner Wagner took most of the story from a medieval poem Parzival by the German poet Wolfram von Eschenbach It was the last opera that Wagner completed He started thinking about it in 1857 but did not do much work to it until after he had finished the cycle of four operas known as the Ring Cycle which was produced complete in 1876 in the special theatre he had built in Bayreuth Wagner composed his opera Parsifal so that it would suit the sound of this new theatre It was first produced in 1882 The story is related to the Arthurian legends

Wagner did more than any other composer in the 19th century to change the way that people listened to opera In the 18th century people went to the opera house and sat in their boxes to chat to other people and be seen Composers wrote operas with big arias which allowed the singers to show off their skills and make the audience applaud 

Wagner changed all this He soon developed operas in which there is no difference between recitative and arias The music of his later operas especially Parsifal is like a long continuous line with rich Romantic harmony The music develops logically with leitmotifs which help the music and the story to develop 

The story of Parsifal and the Holy Grail has survived in several forms that date from between 1170 and 1220 Wagner who always wrote the words of his operas himself used a mixture of several of these versions of the story to fit his ideas for the opera Parsifal is a young man who is a pure fool which means that he is an innocent good man who slowly starts to understand the world The Holy Grail is the cup from which our Saviour Jesus Christ is supposed to have drunk at the Last Supper The Holy Spear is the spear which is supposed to have been the one with which the Roman soldier pierced Jesus side when he was put on the cross The Holy Grail and the Holy Spear are sacred relics which have been given to Titurel and his band of Christian knights to look after Titurel has built a castle Montsalvat high up on the forest rocks to guard them In particular he has to watch out for Klingsor who lives nearby Klingsor is a magician who has a garden full of beautiful flower maidens These maidens are in his power One of them is Kundry She has already been made to broken wikt linklurelure several young knights to Klingsors power Even Titurels son Amfortas could not resist the lure of Kundry His spear was taken from him and he was badly wounded before being rescued At the beginning of the opera he is lying in pain The only thing that could heal the wound would be the touch of the Holy Spear which Klingsor now has and the only person who could get that spear back again is a pure fool a young man who knows nothing about the evil of the world and who can resist the beauty of the flower maidens

The story of Parsifal is an allegory A lot of books have been written about the true meaning of the opera but the general meaning is that the best way to live is to do good things not evil things

The opera starts with an orchestral prelude When the curtain rises Gurnemanz one of the senior knights wakes up two sleeping servants They kneel and pray as King Amfortas is brought down on his bed to the forest lake to bathe his wound Kundry arrives dashing in on her horse looking for something to heal the wound

Suddenly a wounded swan falls dead at Gurnemanzs feet The swan had been killed by Parsifal He did not know that it was a wrong thing to do but when the knights capture him he realizes his broken wikt linkguiltguilt and he breaks the arrow The knights ask him his name but Parsifal says he does not know his name or where he comes from Suddenly the knights realize that Parsifal is the pure fool they need who can capture the Holy Spear

The scene changes The knights take communion Amfortas is in terrible pain but has to do his duty in the ceremony When the Holy Grail is shown it sparkles brightly in the hall The knights sink to their knees Only Parsifal does not seem to understand the meaning of it all

The scene is Klingsors magic garden by his castle Klingsor knows that Parsifal is on his way Kundry is now quite different she has no power of her own The flower maidens see Parsifal and call him by his name No one has ever called him by his name before When one of them kisses his lips he suddenly realizes what it is he has to do He now remembers everything that has happened in Act I and understands its meaning He throws the maiden to one side Klingsor appears and throws the spear at Parsifal but magically it stops over Parsifals head Parsifal grabs it and makes the sign of the cross The castle is destroyed the gardens disappear and he goes off back to the Grail

After a journey which takes him many years Parsifal comes back to the Grail forest Gurnemanz is now very old Kundry works for the knights Parsifal himself is dressed as a black knight Kundry recognizes him but Gurnemanz does not He is annoyed that an armed stranger should come on this holy day Parsifal throws the spear into the ground puts down his weapons and takes off his helmet Gurnemanz realizes who it is He helps him to dress like a knight of the Grail Kundry washes his feet and dries them with her long hair Gurnemanz blesses Parsifals head Parsifal is now a knight of the Grail and he baptizes Kundry Titurel has just died and Amfortas still in terrible pain comes out to uncover the Grail Parsifal enters and touches the wound with the point of the spear Amfortass pain changes to happiness the shrine is opened the Grail is surrounded by light The knights kneel down Kundry dies peacefully All is forgiven The music finishes with a climax based on the leitmotifs of the Holy Grail and the Sacrament

Until 1903 the Bayreuth Festspielhaus was the only place where Wagners opera Parsifal was allowed to be performed This changed after the death of Wagners widow Cosima In 1903 the opera was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York Soon it was being performed in other places as well 

Wagner like to describe Parsifal as ein Bhnenweihfestspiel At Bayreuth it has become tradition that there is to be no applause after the first act of the opera

Tropical Storm Erin was the second tropical cyclone to make landfall on the United States in the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season It was also the fifth named storm of the season Erin formed in the Gulf of Mexico on August 14 from an area of convection which was becoming stronger It became stronger and changed into a tropical storm the next day and on August 16 Erin made landfall near Lamar Texas and was able to not die as it moved over land across Texas before moving towards the north into Oklahoma The storm killed at least 17 people and made an already severe flooding problem in Texas even worse Another different storm that Erin went into killed at least 18 people

On August 9 an area of convection formed just south of Jamaica in association with a trough of low pressure The system moved west northwestward and by August 10 the system had a broad surface trough with a little shower activity Convection increased on August 11 and by August 12 the contact between a tropical wave and an upper level low in the area resulted in a large area of disorganized thunderstorms extending from the western Caribbean Sea into the central Bahamas Upper level winds slowly became more helpful for development and on August 13 a large low pressure area formed about 90 miles north northeast of Cancn Quintana Roo Late on August 14 a NOAA Hurricane Hunters plane that flew into the system reported a small circulation center but at the time was not well defined enough to begin tropical cyclone advisories However deep convection was kept near the increasingly organizaing center and at 0300 UTC on August 15 the National Hurricane Center named it as Tropical Depression Five about 425 miles southeast of Brownsville Texas

In the overnight hours after formation the storm was disorganized with a shabby and abstracted center of circulation Located to the south of a mid to upper level ridge over the southern United States the system moved to the west northwest into an area ideal for further strengthening an upper level anticyclone formed over the central Gulf of Mexico and sea surface temperatures along its track were warm The cloud pattern became better organized keeping a large area of convection with curved rainbands and well established outflow Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Erin at 1530 UTC on August 13 about 250 miles east of Brownsville Texas As it continued northwestward Erin remained disorganized and was not able to strengthen above minimal tropical storm status At 1200 UTC on August 16 the cyclone made landfall near Lamar Texas as it weakened to tropical depression status Three hours later the National Hurricane Center stopped giving out advisories on Erin as warning responsibility was switched to the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center

Slowly moving northwestward through Texas Tropical Depression Erin managed to keep an area of convection near the center with its widespread but scattered rainbands dropping moderate to heavy precipitation By August 17 the winds decreased to 20 mph with higher gusts The system turned to the north northeast on August 18 while heavy bands of thunderstorms continued to spin around the center of Erin Early on August 19 after entering Oklahoma Erin suddenly re intensified to maximum sustained winds of 50 mph a short distance west of Oklahoma City The Norman Oklahoma National Weather Service remarked the intensification resulted in what amounts to an inland tropical storm at 0930 UTC the system showed an eye like feature and a spiral rainband and produced wind gusts of over 80 mph However a few hours later the system began weakening again and late on August 19 Erin degenerated into a remnant low pressure area as the circulation dissipated over northeastern Oklahoma The low continued into southeastern Kansas before dissipating feeding moisture northward toward a frontal system extending from the Midwestern United States through the Mid Atlantic States Its remnant mid level circulation then moved eastward across Missouri Kentucky and Virginia before losing identity as it moved out into the Atlantic Ocean

Instantly after Erin become a tropical depression the National Hurricane Center gave out a tropical storm watch from Freeport Texas to the United StatesMexico border at the same time the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch southward to Rio San Fernando Shortly before achieving tropical storm status the watch in Texas was upgraded to a tropical storm warning Late on August 15 the warning was extended to San Luis Pass while the watch in Mexico was cancelled As Erin made landfall the warnings was cancelled and several flood watches and warnings were given out for counties across southeastern Texas Upon moving into Oklahoma flood and flash flood warnings were issued for several counties

Governor of Texas Rick Perry activated the National Guard and moved emergency personnel to the areas expected to be affected by the storm Erin is expected to bring flooding to the region which had already been declared a disaster area on August 7 2007 from widespread flooding on the Nueces River basin this area remained flooded as of August 15 2007 On August 15 oil futures rose to 7401 because of fears of Erin disturbing oil supplies produced on Texan coasts combined with low oil supplies As a result of the threat from the storm Shell Oil Company evacuated 188 workers on oil platforms in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico

By midday on August 15 rainbands with gusty winds began affecting the Texas coastline As it made landfall the storm created heavy rainfall near and to the or northeast of its path reaching 1102 inches at a station in Lockwood The passage of the storm caused several bayous in the Houston area to reach or go beyond flood levels Across southeastern Texas the cyclone generated several funnel clouds and near Iah a EF0 tornado was reported Wind gusts from Erin were fairly weak across the state peaking at 35 mph at Palacios with an unofficial report of 39 mph at Jamaica Beach While moving onto land the storm produced a small storm surge peaking at 322 feet at Pleasure Pier which caused minor beach erosion

In Clear Lake City heavy rainfall broke down a part of a grocery store roof killing two workers The precipitation caused moderate flooding across eastern parts of Harris County over 400 homes and 40 businesses were flooded Flooding across the Greater Houston area briefly stopped the METRORail and closed several state roads One person drowned after driving into a retention pond Several people needed rescue assistance and in Comal County a car accident killed three people The movement of the storm temporarily left about 20000 electrical customers without power though most outages were quickly restored In San Antonio one body was found from a creek and another died after driving into a flooded road and was swept into a drainage ditch in which four others survived In Sisterdale two people were killed when they were swept away stalled over Sister Creek In Taylor County near Abilene flooding killed one person and forced the evacuation of about 2000 people

After its unexpected redevelopment over Oklahoma heavy damages were also reported there Several communities in central Oklahoma were flooded from the effects of heavy rainfall Watonga Kingfisher and Geary were the hardest hit communities where many houses and buildings were flooded Winds in Watonga gusted as high as 82 mph which damaged numerous trees and power lines and heavily damaged mobile homes The entire community lost power also with about 15000 customers in total in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area A section of Interstate 40 was also closed for a while 

One person was found to have drowned in a cellar in Fort Cobb and another drowned in Kingfisher Another storm related death took place in Seminole Three others were found dead after a weather related automobile accident also near Carnegie Another automobile accident related death took place in Okmulgee County but it is not sure if Erin is to blame there

Although its surface circulation had dissipated its upper circulation remained unbroken and created a burst of rainfall early on August 20 The 1194 inches3033 mm that fell at Miller became the wettest Missouri rainfall total associated with a tropical cyclone or its remains since at least 1976 One person died in Sleeper when he drove into flood waters which had swept away a bridge he was trying to navigate onto Nine water rescues happened along the Interstate 44 passageway which was most effected by Erins rainfall

The Biellmann spin is a spin in figure skating It is performed on one foot The free leg is pulled up from behind and pulled above the head The knee is bent slightly and the back is bent backwards into the spin This forms a teardrop position with the body In the classic version of the spin both arms are used to hold up the leg A slightly changed version has one hand on the skate and the other hand on the arm holding up the skate A change can be made in that one hand can be dropped If the hand holding up the spin is on the same side of the body as the leg the spin is referred to as a one hand Biellmann spin because the spin is being performed with one hand If the hand holding up the spin is on the opposite side of the body as the leg the spin is referred to as a cross grab Biellmann spin because that hand has to cross the body to grab the skate

The spin has also been said to look like a tulip on a turntable It is one of the most iconic figure skating moves Along with the layback spin the Biellmann is used in advertisements and icons representing figure skating The position is also used in spiral sequences

No one knows who invented the spin Cecilia Colledge of Great Britain performed a one handed Biellmann spin in 1937 There is a famous photograph of her doing the spin at the 1937 World Figure Skating Championships Tamara Moskvina of the Soviet Union performed the spin at the 1965 European Championships and there is a famous photo of her doing it as well Both Janet Champion and Slavka Kohout of the United States performed this spin early on

The spin is named after Swiss skater Denise Biellmann who popularized the move Biellmann performed the spin beginning in the 1970s having learned it from her teammate fellow Swiss skater Karin Iten Biellmann performed the spin on her way to becoming World Champion and the spin was officially named for her It is the only figure skating spin officially named after a skater in International Skating Union regulations

The classic positions is explained above This position is often entered into through a layback spin The free leg of the layback is grasped by one or both hands and brought up above the head

Irina Slutskaya of Russia is officially credited with inventing the change foot Biellmann spin She performs the Biellmann on one foot then drops her free leg and performs the spin on her other leg

A half Biellmann spin also called the catch foot camel spin is a Biellmann variation in which the free leg is grasped in a camel spin position and brought up above the head but the upper body is not lifted into the teardrop position

Many skaters have performed a Biellmann variation in which the free leg is brought down towards the face with the knee bent inwards This spin has mostly been performed by Junior level or Junior age skaters because this is easiest to perform before puberty It is unknown who invented this variation It was performed by Naomi Nari Nam at the United States nationals in 1999 More recently it has been brought back by Junior level skaters including Caroline Zhang of the United States who performed the spin on her way to winning the 2007 World Junior title

As well Zhang and other Junior skaters are known for doing a hyper extended Biellmann spin in which the leg is pulled straight up in the air and the back bent as far into the spin as possible Zhang is able to perform the spin with her free leg pulled straight up into the air making the spin look like a capital I This position is not original to Zhang but she has been the one to popularize it

Because of Code of Points the Biellmann spin has been used too much in competitions Many skaters would perform the spin even if they were not flexible enough because it was a good way of getting a lot of points The International Skating Union has limited the number of Biellmann spins that can be performed in a single program

The spin is almost entirely performed by women and it is a common feature in most Junior and Senior level ladies programs as well as being a position for ice dancing lifts It is generally not performed by men because most male skaters are not flexible enough to perform the spin The most famous male skater to perform the spin is Evgeni Plushenko However he has not done it in competition since 2003 Shawn Sawyer has also performed the spin at the Junior level Recently the spin has been performed in competition by Ryo Shibata of Japan and Eliot Halverson of the United States

Year 1445 was a common year It started on a Friday

Begging means asking people for money food shelter or other things when one is not able to give anything instead It is also referred to as sponging spanging or panhandling

In larger cities it is common to see beggars who ask for money food or other items Typically beggars often beg for spare change equipped with coffee cups mugs small boxes hats or other items into which monies can be placed and sometimes display signs with messages such as Help me Im homeless

A 2002 study of 54 panhandlers in Toronto reported that of a median monthly income of 638 CAD those interviewed spent a median of 200 CAD on food and 192 CAD on alcohol tobacco and illegal drugs  The Fraser Institute however criticized this study They said there were many forms of begging including ones in which good money can be earned They also said that panhandlers reports were not reliable 

Because of this some people say that it would be better to give the beggars gift cards or foodservice vouchers instead of money Some shelters also offer business cards with information on the shelters location and services which can be given instead of cash

Aggressive panhandling means to ask for donations or help in a threatening manner This is not mugging but rather similar and therefore often forbidden by law Examples include

A Vacuole is a membranes bound organelle They are a kind of vesicle Vacuoles are closed sacs made of plasma membranes with inorganic or organic molecules inside such as enzymes They have no set shape or size and the cell can change them as it wants They are in most eukaryotic cells and do many things They can store waste Vacuoles and their contents are considered to be distinct from the cytoplasm and are classified as ergastic according to some people The solution that fills the vacuole is called cell sap

What a vacuole does and how important it is depends on what kind of cell they are in They are much more important in plant and fungus cells than in animal cells Some common jobs of a vacuole are

Vacuoles are also important in autophagy keeping a balance between making and getting rid of many things in cells and organisms They also help with destroying and recycling broken proteins that build up in cells Thomas Boller and others think that vacuoles help attack bacteria and Robert B Mellor think that some kinds of vacuoles act as a house for symbiotic bacteria In protists vacuoles also store and help digest food that the protist ate

The College of Arms in London is one of the few remaining government heraldic authorities in Europe It was founded in 1484 by King Richard III and its job is to control heraldry and grant new armorial bearings sometime called coats of arms

The college is run by the Kings of Arms heralds and pursuivants who handle heraldic affairs in England Wales and Northern Ireland on behalf of the Queen 

The college also grants arms to citizens of other Commonwealth countries that do not have their own heralds

As well as designing and granting new arms the College tries to answers many requests from people trying to prove that they are descended from an armigerous person a person descended in the male line from an armiger may be reissued that ancestors arms Special marks called difference marks can be added make the coat of arms different from the arms of their cousins The college is involved in genealogy and have many pedigrees in their records Anyone may register a pedigree with the college where they are carefully checked and need official proofs before being altered

Heralds were originally messengers Officers of the College of Arms still sometimes read Royal proclamations in public for example at the accession of a new sovereign 

They also help plan state ceremonies such as coronations the introduction of new peers into the House of Lords and the ceremonies of orders of chivalry 

For these public appearances the officers of the college wear costume showing their place in the Royal Household either simple red livery or the heralds traditional colourful outfit of a tabard emblazoned with his masters arms

The College of Arms is on Queen Victoria Street in the City of London not far to the south of St Pauls Cathedral The site was given to the college when it was re formed by Philip and Mary I in 1555 and the present 17th century building dates from after the Great Fire of London in 1666

The College of Arms was featured in the 1969 James Bond film On Her Majestys Secret Service where James Bond visits his friend Sir Hillary Bray who permits Bond to impersonate him so he can spy on Blofelds base Bray gives Bond information on Blofelds ancestor Count Balthazzar de Bleuchamp Bond is shown his own coat of arms with the family motto the world is not enough

The Earl Marshal a hereditary office held by the Duke of Norfolk oversees the College but he is not a member He must give his written consent called a warrant before any new coat of arms can be issued The Earl Marshals court can hear cases about using coats arms but the court has not sat since 1954 Usually the Earl Marshal usually leaves affairs to the professional heralds of the College

There are three levels of officers of arms Kings of Arms Heralds and Pursuivants The officers of arms occupy posts bearing traditional titles

The officers of arms earn money from their own private practices in heraldry and genealogy They get only nominal salaries as officers of the College These salaries were set centuries ago and reflect the living costs of the day William IV reduced them to the old level in the 1830s The amounts are listed below and is not taxed

Any letters telephone calls or visitors to the college not for a specific officer of arms are seen by the officer in waiting All members of the college serve as officer in waiting on rotation

Heralds Extraordinary are appointed to take part in special ceremonial occasions or to help the Earl Marshal personally they are not members of the college Among the extraordinary heralds have been 

The New Zealand Herald Extraordinary is not a member of the college but it is a permanent post created to oversee heraldry in New Zealand he works together with the college to grant new arms for people and bodies in that country

The Kings of Arms grant coats of arms by letters patent Before they can even consider the granting of arms an application must be made to the Earl Marshal and a fee paid

The Kings of Arms are authorised in their patents of appointment to grant coats of arms to eminent men Originally this meant someone who was wealthy or had social status By 1530 the heralds wanted successful candidates for a grant of arms to have 300 or rent from land of 10 a year Since the heralds get fees for granting arms they have always been generous when deciding who should be allowed a coat of arms In 1616 Ralphe Brooke York Herald tricked the Garter King of Arms into granting a coat of arms to the common hangman for a fee of 22 shillings

This is why the Earl Marshals permission to grant a coat of arms is needed 

There are no fixed rules about granting modern coats of arms If a herald is approached and does not consider that the application has merit he may tactfully suggest to the applicant that he or she should not proceed If it does proceed its success or otherwise will depend on the approval of the Earl Marshal who may apply his own standards Peter Gwynn Jones has recently written that

The coat of arms or a differenced version of them using marks of cadency can be used by all of the legitimate children of an individual and such children and their descendants may bear the arms from the moment of birth they do not have to wait for the death of the previous generation The College of Arms does not need to approve the use of the arms in each generation the original grant of arms is the only authority required Although daughters and sons inherit the right to bear arms for themselves personally the right passes only through the male line hence a son transmits the arms to his children but a daughter can use them herself but her children cannot A partial exception to this rule is the case of a woman who has no brothers or whose brothers have no children such a woman is called a heraldic heiress and may transmit the arms to her children as a quartering with their fathers arms and to their descendents

The costs involved are quite substantial The applicant does not buy a coat of arms the arms themselves are freely given but fees must be paid to the heralds and artists involved as professionals and to support the buildings and other running costs of the College Aside from the heralds traditional nominal salaries given above the College of Arms is not financed by the taxpayer

The College of Arms is also responsible for recording the changes of names In order to change ones name one must apply for a deed poll to be entered on the Colleges registers and published in the London Gazette 

When a Royal Licence is granted for a transfer of arms the change of the surname may be permitted by the Licence itself so there is no need of a deed poll

Hilberts paradox of the Grand Hotel is a mathematical paradox named after the German mathematician David Hilbert Hilbert used it as an example to show how infinity does not act in the same way as regular numbers do Normal hotels have a set number of rooms This number is finite Once every room has been assigned to a guest any new guest that wants a room and does not have one yet cannot be served  in other words the hotel is fully booked Now suppose that there is a hotel that has an infinite number of rooms As a convenience the rooms have numbers the first room has the number 1 the second has number 2 and so on If all the rooms are filled it might appear that no more guests can be taken in as in a hotel with a finite number of rooms This is wrong though A room can be provided for another guest This can be done by moving the guest in room 1 to room 2 the guest in room 2 and so on In the general case the guest in room n will be moved to room n1 After all guests have moved room 1 is empty and the new guest now has a room to occupy This shows how we can find a room for a new guest even if the hotel is already full something that could not happen in any hotel with a finite number of rooms

Another thing that can be done with this imaginary hotel is to double the number of people inside again when all the rooms are already full This is done by asking each guest to multiply their room number by two and move to that room This would send the guest in room 1 to room 2 the guest in room 2 to room 4 the guest in room 3 to room 6 the guest in room 4 to room 8 and so on After finishing we find that all the rooms with the odd numbers are empty Then we can put an infinite number of guests into these empty rooms Now the number of guests in the hotel has been doubled without making the hotel bigger

This is not really a paradox it is only counterintuitive In a normal hotel with a finite number of rooms the number of odd numbered rooms is smaller than the total number of rooms In Hilberts Hotel this does not seem to be the case

Sui generis is a term from Latin It can be translated to Of own kind It basically means that something has very special characteristics They are so special that the thing cannot really be compared to anything else It is used in various contexts The term was invented by philosophers What they originally wanted to say was that an idea is so unique that it cannot really be part of a broader concept

When lawyers talk about something being sui generis they mean that something is so unique it cannot really be compared With intellectual property a design can be sui generis

The European Union is something that has come to be in the last few years It is not like a state or confederation of states It is more like an International organisation It is mostly classified as sui generis

In the sociology of Emile Durkheim sui generis is used to illustrate his theories on social existence He says that society as it was there before any living individual was born is independent of all individuals His sui generis society will furthermore continue its existence after the individual ceases to interact with it

Meryl Streep was praised in a Wall Street Journal review of The Devil Wears Prada pitch perfect portrayal of Miranda is sui generis with a dramatic existence of its own as unique and memorable as say a Bette Davis character

Martin Kettle in The Guardian said about hung parliaments Each is sui generis dependent on the particular parliamentary arithmetic inter party momentum and surrounding political circumstances

Slate has used the term several times one article discussed the unique variations of French Rose Champagne Grower Champagnes are wines made by small farmers in the Champagne region who bucking convention choose to craft their own wines rather than sell their grapes to the major Champagne houses Typical of farmer fizzes the grower ross are utterly sui generisin a few cases almost freakishly so

A regular polygon is a polygon which is both equilateral and equiangular The simplest examples of regular polygons are equilateral triangle

and square

Compass and straightedge or ruler and compass construction is drawing of lengths angles or shapes using only a ruler and compass Some things cannot be drawn this way For example there are only 32 regular polygons with an uneven number of sides which are known to be constructible It has been proven that a square with the same area as the area of a circle can not be constructed

When Richard Nixon resigned as President in 1974 he flew back to his home in California in Air Force One but halfway to California he stopped being President and the airplane was then given a new name

In the Middle Ages people in Europe believed that Incubi were male demons There were also female demons called succubi They lay on sleeping people to have sexual intercourse with them They would also do this to make other incubi While they had sex with their victim they drained its energy to sustain themselves Sometimes having sex with an incubus may result in a child as in the legend of Merlin Some sources say that the incubus may be identified by its unnaturally cold penis Religious tradition holds that repeated intercourse with such a spirit by either males or females may result in bad health or even death

People have come up with different explanations for the incubus legends In the Middle Ages people worried a lot about sin especially sexual sins of women Victims may have been experiencing waking dreams or sleep paralysis Also nocturnal arousal orgasm or nocturnal emission could be explained by the idea of creatures causing an otherwise guilt producing and self conscious behavior The influence of incubi could also have been used to explain how pregnancies happen outside marriage such pregnancies were often unexplainable 

Victims who claimed to have fallen prey to the influence of incubi could in reality have been victims of sexual assault by a real person Rapists may have attributed the rapes of sleeping women to demons in order to escape punishment A friend or relative may have assaulted the victim in her sleep The victims and in some cases the clergy may have found it easier to explain the attack as supernatural rather than confront the idea that the attack came from a trusted person

One of the earliest mentions of an incubus comes from Mesopotamia on the Sumerian kings list ca 2400 where the hero Gilgameshs father is listed as Lilu It is said that Lilu disturbs and seduces women in their sleep while Lilitu a female demon appears to men in their erotic dreams Two other demons appear as well Ardat lili visits men by night and bears ghostly children from them Irdu lili is the male counterpart to Ardat lili He visits women by night These demons were originally storm demons Because the etymology was interpreted wrongly they were later seen as night demons Also considered to be vampires which is another form of a demon that is said to drink blood from its victims

Incubi and succubi were said by some not to be different sexes but the same demon able to change its sex A succubus would be able to sleep with a man and collect his sperm and then transform into an incubus and use that seed on women Their offspring were thought to be supernatural in many cases even if the actual genetic material originally came from humans 

Many tales claim that the incubus is bisexual but some indicate that it is strictly heterosexual and finds attacking a male victim either unpleasant or detrimental There are also many stories involving the attempted exorcism of incubi or succubi who have taken refuge in the bodies of men or women

Incubi are sometimes said to be able to conceive children The half human offspring of such a union is sometimes referred to as a cambion The most famous legend of such a case includes that of Merlin the famous wizard from Arthurian legend 

According to the Malleus Maleficarum exorcism is one of the five ways to overcome the attacks of Incubi the others being Sacramental Confession the Sign of the Cross moving the afflicted to another location and by excommunication of the attacking entity which is perhaps the same as exorcism On the other hand the Franciscan friar Ludovico Maria Sinistrari stated that incubi do not obey exorcists have no dread of exorcisms show no reverence for holy things at the approach of which they are not in the least overawed

A Commonwealth realm is a country which shares Queen Elizabeth II as monarch

Queen Elizabeth II is

The queen appoints a Governor General to represent her The Governor General is appointed after consulting with the government of the realm and has all of the powers and duties of the queen Usually the Governor General signs all acts of parliament into law but can wait and ask the queen for advice or wait for her to sign the act herself This happened in 1982 when Queen Elizabeth signed the important Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms during a visit to Canada and Australia Act 1986 in Canberra

Although the Queen Elizabeth II is shared with many countries the British government has no power in the other realms just as much the Australian Government has no power in the UK for example

The Battle of Midway was an important naval battle of World War II between the United States and the Empire of Japan It took place from June 4 1942 to June 7 1942 more or less one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea and about six months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that had made war break between the United States and Japan During the battle the United States Navy defeated a Japanese attack against Midway Atoll and destroyed four Japanese aircraft carriers and a heavy cruiser and losing a carrier and a destroyer

The battle was a clear victory for the Americans and usually considered the most important naval battle of World War II The battle weakened the Imperial Japanese Navy for the rest of the war mostly because Japan lost more than 200 pilots

Both nations suffered losses in the battle but Japan could not build up its forces again The Japanese industry had little resources and was very poor compared to the American For this reason the United States replaced their lost ships and planes with better ones very quickly but Japan could only make few and of poor quality

The Japanese plan of attack was to bring Americas carriers into a trap and sink them The Japanese also tried to take Midway Atoll to build Japans defenses as far away from their homeland as possible This operation was considered a previous step before attacking Fiji and Samoa as well as an invasion of Hawaii

The Midway operation like the attack on Pearl Harbor was not part of a campaign for the conquest of the United States but was made by the Empire of Japan to destroy the American strength in the Pacific Ocean This way Japan could become the biggest power in the area and create a great government of Asia under its rule It was also hoped that another defeat would force the US to ask for peace soon with good terms for Japan

After the clear victory the American forces retired Japans loss of four out of their six carriers plus many number of their best air pilots stopped the expansion of the Japanese Empire in the Pacific and the Americans slowly began to advance towards Japan

The Bald Eagle is a bird of prey that lives in North America It is the national bird of the United States of America The Bald Eagle is a kind of sea eagle It can be found in most of Canada all of the United States and the northern part of Mexico It lives near big areas of water where there is a lot of food to eat and old trees to nest in It is called bald because of the white head and neck making it look bald

The species almost died out in the United States late in the 20th century but now has a more stable population

The Bald Eagle is a large bird It is usually as tall as convert70to102cmin and its wingspans are convert244min Female eagles are about 25 percent larger than males Adult females weigh convert58kglbspus while males weigh convert41kglbspus The adult Bald Eagle has a brown body and its head and tail are white It also has golden feet with large talons and a hooked beak The males and the females do not have different colors on their wings

Before Bald Eagles become adults their wings are brown and they are usually speckled with white dots until the fifth year The differences between Bald Eagles and Golden Eagles are that Bald Eagles have a larger head with a bigger beak and their legs do not have feathers 

The size of the bird depends on where it lives The smallest birds are in Florida where an adult male is only about convert23kglbspus The largest Bald Eagles are in Alaska where large females may be as much as convert75kglbspus

When Bald Eagles call they chirp weakly and whistle The young birds whistle more shrilly than adults

Bald Eagles in the wild usually live around 20 years with the oldest ones living to be about 30 When they are taken captive they live much longer

This sea eagle gets both its common and scientific names from its head Bald in the English name is from the word piebald which means one with a white head The scientific name is from Haliaeetus which is Latin for sea eagle

The Bald Eagle was one of the many species written in Carolus Linnaeuss 18th century book Systema Naturae Linnaeus was a Swedish botanist physician and zoologist who made the binomial nomenclature system

There are two main subspecies of the Bald Eagle

The Bald Eagle lives mostly near seas rivers large lakes oceans and other large places with open water and a lot of fish

The Bald Eagle needs old trees with hard wood to live sleep and make a nest on The tree must have an opening and be safe from prey However the height or kind of tree is not as important as having a lake or sea close to the nest

The Bald Eagle does not like to be near humans and so they are found mostly in places free of humans Sometimes Bald Eagles will go to large places with trees that are inside big cities such as in Oregon Even though they are very sensitive to humans a family of Bald Eagles recently moved into Harlem New York

The Bald Eagles natural home is in most of North America including most of Canada all of the United States and northern Mexico

The Bald Eagle is very fast when it flies It reaches the speeds of 5670 kilometers per hour when gliding and flapping However when it is carrying fish it flies about 48 kilometers each hour Its dive speed is convert120 160kmhmphspus though it does not dive a lot It usually migrates depending on the place that it is living in If its territory has water near by it will remain there all year but if the water freezes in the winter it must migrate to the south or to the coast to find something to eat

The Bald Eagle eats mostly fish In the Pacific Northwest spawning trout and salmon are the main food of the Bald Eagle

Sometimes eagles may eat a lot of carrion especially in winter They will also scavenge dead bodies up to the size of whales However eagles eat more large dead fish than whales They also sometimes eat the leftover food from campsites or garbage dumps The mammals they eat include rabbits hares raccoons muskrats beavers and deer fawns Some of the birds they eat include grebes ducks gulls and geese Reptiles amphibians and crustaceans are also eaten

To hunt fish the eagle swoops down over the water and snatches the fish out of the water with its talons They eat by holding the fish in one claw and tearing the flesh with the other Eagles have special things on their toes called spiricules that help them hold the fish more easily Bald Eagles have powerful talons They have been recorded flying with a 7kg fawn Sometimes when the fish is too heavy the eagle will be dragged into the water with it Sometimes eagles swim back to the shore and live but sometimes they may drown or die because of hypothermia Other times Bald Eagles will steal fish and other kinds of food away from other animals Healthy adult Bald Eagles are not eaten anywhere in the wild This makes them thought as one of the top animals of the food chain

Bald Eagles become adults when they are four or five years old When they are old enough to mate they usually come back to the place where they were born It is thought that Bald Eagles mate for life However if one of the pair dies or disappears the other will choose a new mate A pair which can not get a chick after trying for a long time may split up and look for new mates When Bald Eagles court they call and show their flying skills When they do so two mates may fly high and then lock their talons together and fall parting again right before hitting the ground The nest of the Bald Eagle is larger than any other nest in North America This is because it is used again and again and every year more is added to the nest until it may soon become as large as convert4mftspus deep convert25mftspus across and weigh 1 tonne One nest in Florida was found to be convert61mftspus deep convert29mftspus across and to weigh convert3STt1spus The nest is built out of branches usually in large trees near water If there are no trees the Bald Eagle will make its nest on the ground Eagles have between one and three eggs per year Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs The other parent will hunt for food or look for more to add onto the nest The eggs are about convert73mminspus long

Once easily seen on the continental United States the Bald Eagle was close to becoming extinct because of the use of the pesticide DDT The DDT destroyed an adult birds calcium and it would become unable to lay more healthy eggs Female eagles laid eggs that were too weak to withstand the weight of its parents In the early 1700s the number of bald eagles were 300000500000 but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the United States Other things that stopped Bald Eagles from producing well was the loss of habitat and illegal hunting of Bald Eagles Also oil and lead were other big reasons why Bald Eagles began to die out

The species was first protected in the United States and Canada by the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty The 1940 Bald Eagle Protection Act in the United States also tried to stop the killing of the Bald Eagle and the Golden Eagle The Bald Eagle was an endangered species in 1967 and the penalties for people who killed the species grew more and more Also in 1972 DDT was banned in the United States DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989

Because of all this hard work the Bald Eagles population began to rise again It was officially taken out from the United States list of endangered species on July 12 1995

To keep Bald Eagles in captivity the workers had to be experienced in caring for eagles The Bald Eagle can live a long time in captivity if well cared for but does not mate well even under the best care

The Bald Eagle is the national bird of the United States It appears on most of its seals including the Seal of the President of the United States The Continental Congress made the design for the Great Seal of the United States with a Bald Eagle holding thirteen arrows and an olive branch with thirteen leaves in its talons on June 20 1782

The Bald Eagle can be found on both national seals and on the back of several coins Between 1916 and 1945 the Flag of the President of the United States showed an eagle facing to its left

There is a popular legend that Benjamin Franklin once supported the Wild Turkey as a symbol of the United States instead of the Bald Eagle However there is no evidence that this is true The legend comes from the letter Franklin wrote to his daughter in 1784 from Paris However this letter was about the Society of the Cincinnati and it did not say anything about the Bald Eagle or the Wild Turkey

The Bald Eagle is a holy bird in some North American cultures Its feathers are thought to be special They are used very much in spiritual customs among the Native Americans Eagles are thought as messengers between gods and humans Eagle feathers are often used in traditional things especially in fans The Lakota people for instance give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to a person who achieves a task In modern times it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college The Pawnee people thought eagles as symbols of nature and fertility This is because their nests are built high off the ground and because they protect their young very bravely The Choctaw explained that the Bald Eagle who can see the sun more directly is a symbol of peace

During the Sun Dance which is danced by a lot of Native American tribes the eagle is included in many different ways A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used during the dance Also during the dance a medicine man may direct his fan which is made of eagle feathers to people who need healing The fan is then held up toward the sky so that the eagle may send all the sick prayers to the god

However Native American tribes cannot use Bald or Golden Eagle feathers for their religious or spiritual use anymore This is because of a law called the eagle feather law The eagle feather law usually defends Native Americans by providing many exceptions to wildlife laws but it presently does not yet allow Native American tribes to use them yet This made the Native American groups angry because they insisted that it was stopping their ability to use their religion freely

A monthly magazine published by the Smithsonian Institution is also named the Smithsonian

The Smithsonian Institution was founded for the increase and diffusion of knowledge by a bequest to the United States by the British scientist James Smithson who had never visited the United States himself In Smithsons will he stated that should his nephew Henry James Hungerford die without heirs the Smithson estate would go to the United States of America for creating an Establishment for the increase diffusion of Knowledge among men After the nephew died without heirs in 1835 President Andrew Jackson informed Congress of the bequest which amounted to 104960 gold sovereigns or USD 500000

Eight years later Congress passed an act establishing the Smithsonian Institution

The Smithsonian Institution Building on the National Mall is known as The Castle because its design looks similar to a European castle

Though the Smithsonians first leader Joseph Henry wanted the Institution to be a center for scientific research before long it became the depository for various Washington and US government collections

In the early morning of March 23 1920 the Azeri army soldiers and Kurdish gangs attacked the Armenian part of town and began a horrible massacre of the Armenian population which finished in March 26 1920

The famous Russian poet Osip Mandelstam who was in Shushi in 1931 wrote a poem called The phaeton driver dedicated to this tragedy

These were my fears

Forty thousand dead windows 

Are visible there from all directions 

The cocoon of soulless work

In July 1 1997 the Baroness Caroline Cox gave a speech in the House of Lords United Kingdom remembering the lives of Armenians who have been killed and specifically mentioned the occurrence in Shushi in 1920

According to the Jewish tradition God telling Adam and Eve not to eat from the Tree was to give them free choice and allow them to earn perfection instead of getting it with a simple deed According to this tradition Adam and Eve would have become perfect and immortal had they not eaten from the Tree After failing they were sentenced to a long time of hard work to get themselves back into Gods trust

In Christianity the Tree of Knowledge is connected to the beginning of sin By eating the fruit of the Tree Adam and Eve tried to become like God 

In Buddhism the Buddha became enlightened under a Bodhi tree While the biblical tree is usually seen as representing pleasure the Bodhi tree gave pure knowledge

An Automatic Teller Machine or ATM for short is a machine that lets people take out cash from their bank accounts In the United Kingdom ATMs are often called cash machines cashpoints or the hole in the wall

Some ATMs allow people to do more than take money out They may allow people to put in money or check how much money is in a bank account

ATMs may be found in stores and shopping malls Sometimes they can be found in bars or restaurants Other times at special events people may set one up so the guests can use the machine like at a fundraiser

People need a debit card or credit card in order to use an ATM They will also need to have a Personal Identifying Number which is a code that lets them get into their account

There are a number of scams with ATMs In one scam con artists look over the victims shoulder and find their PIN this is known as shoulder surfing In another they may install a video camera and get PIN numbers from that way They then make cards using the PIN number and account number to be able to use that persons account

The Garden of Eden is the place where the first man Adam and the first woman Eve lived after they were created by God 

In the Christian Bible the story of the creation of the world in the book of Genesis describes how Adam and Eve lived in Eden in peace with all of the animals They tended the garden and could eat from any tree except the Tree of Knowledge After they ate from the Tree of Knowledge God punished Adam and Eve by making them leave the Garden of Eden forever

The story is told in Book of Genesis 1 3 in the old Testament of the Bible and the Tanakh The Tanakh translates the Garden of Eden as Paradise 

In Sumerian Eden is a name for the Steppe Heavenly Eden is also mentioned It refers to a place that appears to be fertile at first but later changes to become infertile Climatologists have said this is a good description of the climate change that happened in The Levant after the last ice age The green steppe became dry This meant that food was no longer available all year round but only at certain times This forced the people living at the time to start agriculture and to keep some of their food for the periods where there was none Scientists have referred to this change as the Neolithic Revolution This change of food is also mentioned in the story

Babylonian mythology sees the main reason for the creation of man to grow food for the gods This is different in the Bible There god created plants as food for humans and animals to keep them company

The beginning of the Book of Genesis has been seen as describing the state before a climate change in a certain region Because of this change humans were condemned to growing crops and keeping some food in stock to be able to eat it during the times it did not grow Genesis has been seen to only start when this region converted to agriculture This means that Genesis roughly covers the time from about 8000  6000 BC to about 2000 BC

Judaism teaches that sin cannot be passed on from the parents to their children There is a free will everyone is responsible for their own sins only Humans can do bad things and good things Gods commandments help them do good things What exactly makes up the Commandments of God is not written down but needs to developed by tradition Sins are forgiven once a year Unlike Christianity Judaism has no personified evil

Christianity believes that sin can be passed on from the parents to their children This is known as original sin Without Jesus humans must live in sin Augustine of Hippo formalized this belief which is now a dogma in the Western Christian denominations

Islam sees Adam and Eve being chased away as a chance for a new start Islam says the Christian concept of original sin is false This means that them being chased away does not change the relationship between men and God According to Islamic tradition Adam and Eve were placed in different parts of the world They first had to wander around before they found each other

The Wigmore Hall is a famous concert hall in London It is called a recital hall because it is designed for recitals concerts given by one soloist or sometimes a small group of musicians It is in Wigmore Street in the centre of London just north of Oxford Street

The Wigmore Hall was built in 1901 by the German firm Bechstein who made pianos Originally it was called Bechstein Hall Bechsteins showrooms were next door The hall was built in a Renaissance style with alabaster and marble walls and a rectangular hall with a small raised stage Above the stage the ceiling is in the form of a cupola which has a painting which shows the Soul of Music looking up at the Genius of Harmony a ball of eternal fire whose rays are reflected across the world These are separated by thorns from the rest of the picture which includes a musician and on the other side Psyche inspiring a composer to write music

Because it was owned by a German firm the hall was seized as enemy property during World War I The hall with over 130 pianos was sold at an auction to Debenhams for a very small amount of money and was re opened as Wigmore Hall in 1917 Musicians who have performed there since include Sviatoslav Richter Vladimir Ashkenazy Elisabeth Schwarzkopf Victoria de los ngeles Sergei Prokofiev Shura Cherkassky Paul Hindemith Andrs Segovia Benjamin Britten and Francis Poulenc

The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music or ABRSM is an organisation that arranges music examinations The organisation is based in London but they arrange examinations in places all over the world Many people especially children who learn instruments take examinations of the ABRSM as it helps them to become better players because it gives them something to work for People of any age can take the exams Those who pass an exam get a certificate Over 620000 candidates take the ABRSM examinations every year in over ninety countries

The organisation is called Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music because it is organised by a group of four music conservatoires 

Exams can be taken on many different instruments In nearly each case there are eight grades numbered from 1 to 8 For example someone who has learned the piano for a short while may take Grade 1 once he or she can play pieces such as a simple minuet and play a few scales with separate hands By the time they take Grade 8 they will need to be able to play movements from sonatas by composers such as Beethoven play all 24 scales in various ways very fluently and be good at sight reading

The marks are given out of 150 The pass mark is 100 Below 100 marks is a Fail 120 marks and above is called a Merit and 130 and above is a Distinction

Although some students take each of the grades as they get better at their instrument it is not necessary to have passed earlier grades in order to take a higher grade For grades 6 and above it is necessary to have passed Grade 5 Theory or Practical Musicianship or Jazz This is to make sure that students have a good knowledge of music

The examiners are people who are professional musicians Many of them are music teachers They have a wide experience of music and they are trained by the ABSCM so that they all mark in the same way

There are four kinds of exams

These are by far the most commonly taken exams Available for over 35 instruments these exams consist of 4 different sections

Each section has a certain number of marks and all the marks add up to 150 100 is a pass 120 a merit and 130 a destinction

There is also a Prep Test for those who are not yet ready to take Grade 1 but would like to have the experience of taking an exam Students who take a Prep Test are not given a mark It is a way to encourage young people and make them relaxed about the idea of taking exams

These are written papers about musical theory They are marked out of 100 66 or more is a pass 80 or more is a merit 90 or more is a distinction

These exams will test a students understanding of rhythm melody key and notation together with the ability to sing and play from memory and improvise and to recognise changes to and answer questions about a score

These are the newest types of exams Jazz piano was first offered in 1999 At the moment they are only available for flute piano clarinet saxophone trumpet and trombone They are also only available from Grades 1 5 They are marked in the same way as practical exams However many of the pieces include large sections where they have to improvise using particular chords

For each discipline there are three levels of award

These are professional qualifications which allow a person to put the letters after his or her name

Engraving is putting a design onto a hard flat surface by carving into it The result may be a decorative piece in itself as when silver gold or steel are engraved or may provide a printing plate of copper or another metal for printing images on paper which are also called engravings Engraving was an important method in history of making images on paper both in artistic ways such as making a decorative print and also for printing books and magazines It has long been replaced by photography in its commercial uses and is nowadays much less common in printmaking where it has been almost completely replaced by etching and other techniques

Engravers use a steel tool called a burin to cut the picture or pattern into the surface mostly a copper plate Gravers come in a variety of shapes and sizes that give different line types when used The burin gives us a line that is unique because of its steady appearance and smooth edges The angle tint tool has a slightly curved tip that is commonly used in printmaking Florentine liners are flat bottomed tools with multiple lines on them used to do work on larger areas Flat gravers are used for doing work on letters as well as most musical instrument engraving work Round gravers are commonly used on silver as well as other hard to cut metals such as nickel and steel 

In ancient history the only engraving that could be made were the shallow grooves found in some jewellery after 1000 BC 

In the European Middle Ages goldsmiths used engraving to decorate metal It is thought that they began to print impressions of their designs to record them From this grew the engraving of copper printing plates to make artistic images on paper in Germany in the 1430s The first and greatest period of engraving was from about 1470 to 1530 with such masters as Martin Schongauer Albrecht Drer and Lucas van Leiden 

Thereafter engraving tended to lose popularity to etching which was a much easier technique for an artist to learn By the nineteenth century most engraving was for commercial picture making 

Before the invention of photography engraving was used to reproduce other forms of art for example paintings Engravings continued to be common in newspapers and many books into the early 20th century because they were cheap to use in printing

Because of the high level of detail that can be done by a master engraver faking engraved designs is almost impossible and modern banknotes are almost always engraved as are plates for printing money checks bonds and other papers that should not be faked Engraving is so fine that a normal printer can not make the detail of hand engraved images properly In the US Bureau of Engraving and Printing more than one engraver will work on the same printing plate making it nearly impossible for any person to duplicate all the engraving on almost any banknote or document 

Many classic postage stamps were engraved although the practice is now mostly confined to particular countries or used when a more elegant design is desired and a limited amount of different colours is acceptable

Engraving machines such as the K500 or K6 by Hell Gravure Systems use a diamond pen to cut cells Each cell creates one printing dot later in the process A K6 can have up to 18 engraving heads each cutting 8000 cells per second to an accuracy of 01 m and below They are of course fully computer controlled and the whole process of cylinder making is fully automatic

The engraving process with diamonds is state of the art since the 1960s 

Now laser engraving machines are being made and even today the mechanical cutting has proven its strength in economical terms and quality More than 4000 engravers make about 8 million printing cylinders worldwide per year

The earliest allusion to engraving in the Bible may be the reference to Judahs seal ring followed by Engraving was commonly done with pointed tools of iron or even with diamond points 

Each of the two onyx stones on the shoulder pieces of the high priests ephod was engraved with the names of six different tribes of Israel and each of the 12 precious stones that adorned his breastpiece was engraved with the name of one of the tribes The holy sign of dedication the shining gold plate on the high priests turban was engraved with the words Holiness belongs to Jehovah Bezalel along with Oholiab was qualified to do this specialized engraving work as well as to train othersEx 3530 35 289 12 396 14 30

Most decks are made with six to nine plywood layers Other materials used in making decks fiberglass bamboo resin Kevlar carbon fiber aluminum and plastic All these make the board more light Some decks made from maple plywood are dyed to make many different colored plywood Modern decks are different in size Most are 7 to 105 inches wide Wider decks can be used for greater stability when transition or ramp skating Skateboard decks are normally between 28 and 33 inches long The bottom of the deck can be printed with a design by the maker Or it can be blank

The longboard a common different kind of skateboard has a longer deck This is mostly ridden down hills or by the beach The longboard was made by two surfers Ben Whatson and Jonny Drapper One of the first deck companies was called Drapped taken from Jonnys second name Old school boards are mostly wider and often have only one kicktail Different kinds of the 1970s often have little or no concavity whereas 1980s models have deeper concavities and steeper kicktails

Some cities have short freeways that get a three digit number That means that there is an extra number put ahead of the number of the Interstate This number is even if the Interstate goes around a city and connects with another Interstate and odd if an Interstate goes into a city and ends at a road that is not an Interstate Highway Numbers can be used again in different states Three digit Interstates usually go to the Interstate in their last two numbers For example Interstate 195 goes to Interstate 95

Let It Be was a 1970 album and movie by rock band The Beatles It was the last Beatles project finished before the band broke up

After the White Album was released in late 1968 the Beatles talked about making a television special where they would play songs from the album for an audience It would be the bands first live public performance since 1966

As 1969 began the band decided instead to begin work on a new set of songs and film the process of rehearsing and recording all the songs then performing them live The project was titled Get Back and a song by that name was worked up during rehearsals The band agreed to perform all the songs without studio broken wikt linkretouchingretouching or broken wikt linkoverduboverdubs as they had long used

The Beatles rented a broken wikt linksoundstagesoundstage at Twickenham Film Studios where their instruments and equipment were set up They were used to working from afternoons until late at night on music but had to arrive between eight and ten oclock in the morning to meet the filming schedule The band did not use this setup for long The early hours and the cold huge soundstage made them uncomfortable

There was also broken wikt linkfrictionfriction between the Beatles and it showed The Beatles could not agree on where to perform the show and for how large an audience The suggested locations ranged from Los Angeles California to Tunisia and the size of the audience from a few dozen to thousands of people Nobody had a location in mind that the rest liked and George Harrison decided he did not want to perform a public concert at all

Paul McCartney took charge of the rehearsals and drove the band hard to play his new songs just the way he imagined them The other Beatles became tired of this because it did not give them much chance to broken wikt linkimproviseimprovise the way they were used to doing George Harrison got especially tired of McCartney telling him what to play and his own songs not getting the attention they deserved John Lennon also had new songs but was more interested in spending time with Yoko Ono than in making another Beatles record He was also broken wikt linkcriticalcritical of Harrisons new songs Yoko Ono gave her opinions on the bands music which they were not used to hearing from anyone but their producer George Martin McCartney and Harrison broken wikt linkresentresented Onos being at Lennons side constantly Ringo Starr tried to play the peacemaker but did not always succeed Harrison walked out during one lunch break saying he had had enough The band stopped work on the production and decided to find a new location to work

Harrison went to a Beatles business meeting a few days after he left the rehearsal McCartney agreed to mend his ways and let Harrison have more input Lennon and Harrison also made up The idea of finishing Get Back with a public show was dropped Nobody wanted to return to the movie studio and they began to look for another place to work on their new songs

Magic Alex a Greek born inventor had been hired by the Beatles to build them a new recording studio in the basement of the broken wikt linktownhousetownhouse which was the home of their company Apple Corps Alex spent a great deal of money over many months trying to make a first rate facility He did not understand recording or studio technology well though and the studio he made had many technical problems The Beatles only found this out when they tried to use the place to record Things did not work and this added to the tension felt by the band and the people who worked for them

George Martin was able to help the Beatles by working around the problems in the basement studio He borrowed recording equipment so the band could finish their project The movie cameras were also set up in the basement and the Beatles went back to work on their music This time things were as crowded as the first location was cavernous and again the band and their crew were uncomfortable

The Beatles usually warmed up by playing old songs they had learned growing up Many of these were captured on camera or tape during the sessions Not all the songs were complete or true to their original versions When the band went from playing old songs to trying out new ones problems came up Lennon McCartney and Harrison each wanted certain things for their music and enough time to make the records the best they could be This did not always work out and they sometimes insulted each other for trying to outdo the others or for letting their musical influences show It made the sessions unpleasant

George Harrison helped the broken wikt linkmoralemorale of the band when he brought a guest musician Billy Preston to the sessions All of the Beatles liked Preston and got along while he was there He played keyboards along with the band and gave the records a fuller sound McCartneys girlfriend Linda brought her daughter Heather to the studio and they helped cheer things up Linda sang background vocals on Let It Be a gospel like song by McCartney

The question of where and when to finally perform the new songs was settled when the Beatles decided to give a show on the roof of Apple headquarters This happened on January 30 1969 early in the afternoon The Beatles performed for the movie cameras and for anyone who could hear them outside

As it happened the music coming from the rooftop caused a traffic jam along Savile Row where the building was located Local police came to Apple and tried to stop the show Mal Evans one of the Beatless most trusted helpers went downstairs and talked to the police to stall them until the band could finish playing After performing Get Back Dont Let Me Down Ive Got A Feeling One After 909 Dig A Pony and another version of Get Back the band went inside

The next day the Beatles gave another show back in the Apple basement This show was for the cameras though and not a live audience They performed Two of Us Dont Let Me Down Let it Be Get Back and The Long and Winding Road Some of these songs were too hard to record outdoors with their keyboard parts

The film crew shot more than a hundred hours of movie footage which was more than enough to make a television special The Beatles worked a little longer on the recordings of the Get Back songs ending up with over twenty nine hours of session tapes The problem was nobody was happy with the music that had come from the sessions The band members had argued and disagreed on camera and did not always make their best efforts on each others songs or to get along This was plain to anyone who saw the footage or listened to the dialogue between songs

George Martin tried to remix the recordings and make an album from the songs while the Beatles film personnel tried to edit the movie footage into the TV special the band wanted The bands problems were only magnified by the results and they blamed each other and the people who worked for them for what showed The Beatles decided to abandon the project and work on other things Only one single was released from the sessions with the songs Get Back and Dont Let Me Down Billy Prestons name appeared underneath the bands and stories started that Preston might join the Beatles He never did but he signed a recording contract with Apple Records their record label The other songs stayed in the can

The Get Back project became another problem that was dividing the Beatles There was also trouble with Apple Corps and personal issues between the band members They had begun to make music apart the year before and this increased as they stopped getting along as people McCartney and Lennon both married their girlfriends and lost control of their publishing company Northern Songs George Harrison began to play with musicians outside the Beatles Ringo Starr started a new career as an actor in movies The Beatles issued a new single with the songs The Ballad of John and Yoko and Old Brown Shoe John and Paul played on the first song and George and Ringo on the second They had stopped working as a unit and George Martin stopped coming to recording sessions which he had never done before

During the summer of 1969 the Beatles felt sorry for the way the Get Back sessions had gone They wanted to forget that time and make another new album of songs back at Abbey Road Studios George Martin decided to come back on the bands promise that they really would work together like the old days with Martin taking charge The band kept their promise Abbey Road was the result and was issued in the early fall As the record was being released the Beatles met to discuss future projects John Lennon freshly back from his first non Beatles concert playing in Toronto surprised everyone by announcing that he was quitting the band He agreed to not make a public announcement because this would have hurt the bands chance to broken wikt linkrenegotiaterenegotiate their recording contract Lennon instead focused on his and Yoko Onos new group the Plastic Ono Band

At the end of the year Apples accountants told the Beatles that they would have to release some kind of album and program from the Get Back sessions They had spent too much money on the project to just forget about it Glyn Johns a young music producer tried to assemble an album from the session tapes but he also could not please the Beatles Anxious fans and insiders worked together and released a broken wikt linkbootlegbootleg album from Johnss mix Even though it was an broken wikt linkunauthorizedunauthorised album it sold many copies and received radio airplay The public wanted to hear the songs good or bad

Phil Spector a legendary producer who predated the Beatles had always wanted to work with them Allen Klein brought Spector to England early in 1970 to meet them John Lennon and George Harrison got along well with Spector who produced a record of Lennons song Instant Karma the same day he wrote it Lennon and Harrison gave their OK for Spector to work on the recordings and Ringo Starr played along with the musicians Spector hired to make overdubs This went against the original plan to present the songs live but was accepted to sweeten and finish the recordings

An eighty minute program was edited together from the film footage and the band decided it would make a better movie than a television show The Beatles had a contract with United Artists who agreed to distribute the movie which was titled Let it Be

Some of the new songs that appeared in the movie including Across the Universe and I Me Mine were not finished on record A session was scheduled in January 1970 to record full versions of some songs but John Lennon refused to attend George Harrison made a joke about this during a take of I Me Mine referring to Lennon as Dave Dee another British musician

Spector applied his Wall of Sound style to the Beatles recordings including an old tape of Across the Universe so it could appear on record His finished album was listenable and showed none of the troubles that affected the band during the sessions but it did not sound the same as other Beatles albums Paul McCartney hated the changes Spector made to his songs on the album especially The Long and Winding Road but he could not stop the album from being issued

Another problem was the timing of the records release Allen Klein had succeeded in remaking the Beatless recording deal and McCartney was not bound by the same promise Lennon had been to not say he was leaving the band His first solo album finished early in 1970 included a press release stating that he had no further plans to work with the Beatles This effectively broke up the band He also wanted the album released ahead of Let it Be 

Ringo Starr who also had a solo record due to appear was sent to ask McCartney to change his release date The two argued and McCartney threw Starr out of his house The release schedule was changed so McCartney could have his wish Starrs album appeared earlier than planned and Let it Be was pushed back from April to May

Let it Be was both a hit movie and a hit album and won a Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack Paul McCartney accepted the award The news that the Beatles were breaking up was very sad to their fans however and the knowledge made watching the movie a broken wikt linkbittersweetbittersweet experience Many fans and critics did not like Spectors changes to the Beatles style on record and said so publicly

A souvenir book was also issued but instead of being a real document of the sessions the book was broken wikt linkcensorcensored and heavily edited and reflected little of what was intended It never appeared in the United States

Late in 1970 John Lennon issued a solo album John LennonPlastic Ono Band which made his feelings plain in its last song God Lennon sang I dont believe in Beatles He gave a long interview to Rolling Stone magazine which was later published as a book Lennon Remembers He told his side of the Let it Be story declared That movie was set up by Paul for Paul and said he regretted not announcing that he quit the Beatles first

When home video came along in the 1970s Let it Be became a popular rental and sales title Over time the Beatles asserted their copyright control over the movie and copies were withdrawn The movie has been planned as a reissue many times but has yet to be officially released on DVD

In 2003 recording engineers went back to the old session tapes and used broken wikt linkdigital remasteringdigital remastering to make a new version of the familiar Let it Be songs The new version was close to what the Beatles had wanted to make in the first place and had none of Spectors post production work The album was issued as Let it Be Naked and was praised as a real sounding recording

The House of Commons of Canada is a part of the Parliament of Canada along with the Sovereign and the Senate The House of Commons is an elected body of 308 members who are known as Members of Parliament Members are elected for a maximum of five years at a time Each member is elected by one of the countrys federal electoral districts which are usually called ridings

The House of Commons was established in 1867 when the British North America Act 1867cite weburl title British  created the Dominion of Canada and was modelled on the British House of Commons The House of Commons is sometimes called the lower house even though it has more power than the upper house the Senate Both Houses is must agree to new laws but the Senate very rarely rejects bills passed by the Commons The Government of Canada is responsible only to the House of Commons The Prime Minister stays in office only as long as he or she has the support of the Lower House 

The Canadian House of Commons is in the Centre Block of the Parliament Buildings on Parliament Hill in Ottawa Ontario

Unlike the Parliament of the United Kingdom the powers of the Parliament of Canada are limited because provincial legislatures have the sole right to pass laws about some things

Until 1982 only the Parliament of the United Kingdom had the power to change the British North America Act this was to protect the rights and powers of the provincial legislatures This was changed by the Canada Act In Canada the British North America Act is now called the Constitution Act 

A lot of the work of the House of Commons is done by committees which can spend more time investigating a subject than the whole House of Commons could

Riboflavin is one of the B vitamins The B and C vitamins are the vitamins that dissolve in water A healthy persons gut can easily take riboflavin from food and pass it on to the blood for the body to use The body needs the B vitamins to get energy from food Without riboflavin and the other B vitamins peoples bodies cannot use fats carbohydrates and proteins

These foods have a lot of riboflavin We say that they are rich in riboflavin or good sources of riboflavin

Light can break down riboflavin molecules into other molecules that the body cannot use

If anyone eats too much riboflavin the gut does not take up enough to make a person sick but an injection with too much riboflavin can make one sick The kidneys pass riboflavin out in the urine so when there is too much riboflavin in the body the part that one does not want will not stay in the blood for long If there is much riboflavin in the urine the urine becomes bright fluorescent yellow Vitamin pills or a meal with a lot of liver or egg white turns the urine yellow because such foods put so much riboflavin into the blood

To make Vitamin B2 for vitamin pills or to add to foods industrial companies grow special yeasts other fungi or bacteria that make a lot of riboflavin

Riboflavin is yellow or orange yellow so it can be useful as a food coloring People get some very bad kinds of sickness when their food has too little riboflavin Adding extra riboflavin can stop people from getting such sicknesses To prevent riboflavin deficiency people may add riboflavin to baby foods breakfast cereals pasta sauces fruit drinks and foods such as cheese that are made from milk People call it fortification with riboflavin when they add riboflavin to food A lot of the riboflavin that people make they use in vitamin pills

When there is too little riboflavin in the food it causes what people call a primary riboflavin deficiency Some people who have something wrong with their guts get what people call a secondary riboflavin deficiency even if there is plenty of riboflavin in the food the sick gut cannot get it out of the food and pass it on to the blood

Riboflavin deficiency can cause sores in the mouth cracked red lips cracks at the corners of the mouth and a sore throat The eyes may become yellow stinky and watery and bright light might hurt the eyes easily so that it is hard to open the eyes in strong daylight A riboflavin deficiency also can cause dry scaly skin that cracks easily and itchy painful private parts

When all these three things go wrong angular cheilitis photophobia and sore itchy skin on the private parts doctors call it the oral ocular genital syndrome The syndrome shows that there may be riboflavin deficiency

If riboflavin deficiency gets bad enough in animals they grow too little become unhealthy and they may die Dogs with bad riboflavin deficiency do not grow well their skins become sore and their hair may fall out Their eyes become cloudy their insides may bleed they become weak they cannot move or even stand properly In the end they lie down and die All this is very much like what one might see in humans with riboflavin deficiency but we seldom see such things except where people are very poor and starving Still millions of people in rich countries do not understand the need to eat the right foods or are too poor They might have quite such bad signs of riboflavin deficiency but still have what we call sub clinical symptoms not bad enough to send them to hospital but bad enough to make them unhealthy and to stop children from growing properly and becoming healthy

Subclinical riboflavin deficiency also happens more easily in women taking the contraceptive pill It also may happen when people get old or cannot eat properly or who have sicknesses such as AIDS inflammatory bowel disease diabetes and chronic heart disease We can tell that the body does not lose all its riboflavin easily because riboflavin deficiency does not cause bad sickness all at once

A peer is a member of the nobility It is sometimes used instead of Lord In formal or old British documents the House of Lords is called the House of Peers

In the United Kingdom there are five ranks of the peerage

Informally Barons Viscounts Earls and Marquesses are called lords and instead of their name when speaking to them the term my lord is used A Duke is never called a lord Your grace is used for a Duke

Since 2004 a list of peers has been kept by the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice This list called the Roll of Peerage had to be kept to prove who was a peer The list of members of the House of Lords used to be the same until the hereditary peers were excluded Official documents can only call someone a peer if their name is on the Peerage Roll

Sorting out which peer should precede in a procession or other event depends on three different things

The only exceptions are the royal dukes and the Duke of Abercorn

Fertility is the natural capability to give life In humans and animals fertility means that the parent can produce babies 

More precisely fertility is the capacity of an individual or population to produce viable offspring By viable is meant able to live and reproduce

In agriculture fertility means that a soil can support the growth of plants because it contains the right minerals and nutrients 

Fertility can also be used as a metaphor having a fertile imagination means being able to think of many new and interesting things

As a measure fertility rate is the number of children born per couple person or population This is different to fecundity This is defined the potential for reproduction In the English language the term was originally applied only to females but increasingly is applied to males as well as common understanding of reproductive mechanisms increases and the importance of the male role is better known Infertility is a deficient fertility

Human fertility depends on factors of nutrition sexual behavior culture instinct endocrinology timing economics way of life and emotions Animal fertility is no less complex and may display astounding mechanisms

In the United States the average age of menarche is about 125 years However in most girls menarche does not signal that ovulation has occurred In postmenarchal girls about 80 of the cycles are anovulatory in the first year after menarche 50 in the third and 10 in the sixth year Womens fertility peaks between ages 22 26 and after 35 it starts to sharply decline 

According to Henri Leridon PhD an epidemiologist with the French Institute of Health and Medical Research of women trying to get pregnant without using fertility drugs or in vitro fertilization

The use of fertility drugs andor in vitro fertilization can increase the chances of becoming pregnant at a later age

Postmodernism is a word that describes a kind of response to culture and thought The term has been used in many different ways at different times but there are some things in common

Postmodernism rejects the idea of objective truth and universal social progress Starting with the 18th century Enlightenment and for more than a century there was widespread belief that science and knowledge would improve the world Social progress would be inevitable Modernism in particular held these beliefs

Postmodernism challenges all this certainty Postmodernist thought is an intentional departure from modernist approaches that had previously been dominant Postmodernism has influenced many cultural fields including literary criticism philosophy sociology linguistics architecture visual arts and music

Although the term was first used around 1870 its modern appearance was to express criticism of modern architecture In 1949 the term was used to describe a dissatisfaction with modern architecture leading to the postmodern architecture movement Postmodern architecture returns to surface ornament historical reference in decorative forms and non orthogonal angles

Postmodernist ideas can be seen in philosophy the analysis of culture and society literature architecture and design Changes in history law and culture came in the late 20th century These developments were a re evaluation of the entire Western value system All that took place since the 1950s and 1960s and are described with the term Postmodernity as opposed to Postmodernism a term referring to an opinion or movement Whereas something being Postmodernist would make it part of the movement its being Postmodern would place it in the period of time since the 1950s making it a part of contemporary history 

The term Postmodernism is often used to refer to different sometimes contradictory concepts Conventional definitions follow

While the term Postmodern and its derivatives are freely used with some uses apparently contradicting others those outside the academic milieu have described it as merely a buzzword that means nothing Dick Hebdige in his text Hiding in the Light writes

 When it becomes possible for a people to describe as postmodern the dcor of a room the design of a building the diegesis of a film the construction of a record or a scratch video a television commercial or an arts documentary or the intertextual relations between them the layout of a page in a fashion magazine or critical journal an anti teleological tendency within epistemology the attack on the metaphysics of presence a general attenuation of feeling the collective chagrin and morbid projections of a post War generation of baby boomers confronting disillusioned middle age the predicament of reflexivity a group of rhetorical tropes a proliferation of surfaces a new phase in commodity fetishism a fascination for images codes and styles a process of cultural political or existential fragmentation andor crisis the de centring of the subject an incredulity towards metanarratives the replacement of unitary power axes by a plurality of powerdiscourse formations the implosion of meaning the collapse of cultural hierarchies the dread engendered by the threat of nuclear self destruction the decline of the university the functioning and effects of the new miniaturised technologies broad societal and economic shifts into a media consumer or multinational phase a sense of placelessness or the abandonment of placelessness or a generalised substitution of spatial for temporal coordinates  when it becomes possible to describe all these things as Postmodern then its clear we are in the presence of a buzzword

British historian Perry Andersons history of the term and its understanding The Origins of Postmodernity explains these apparent contradictions and demonstrates the importance of Postmodernism as a category and a phenomenon in the analysis of contemporary culture

Lady Linda Louise Eastman See McCartney was the first wife of musician Paul McCartney She was the mother of artists Heather McCartney and Mary McCartney fashion designer Stella McCartney and musician James McCartney Her father was attorney Lee Eastman whose law partner was his son John Eastman Her mother was Louise Linder who was an heiress to a broken wikt linkdepartment storedepartment store fortune

Linda grew up in Scarsdale New York and attended Sarah Lawrence College She enjoyed music and sang engirl group songs with friends When The Beatles became famous in America she attended one of their concerts She never considered a musical career

Before long she began to photograph rock bands and singers She became well known for this The Rolling Stones once made her the exclusive photographer for one of their public appearances In time she visited England to photograph the broken wikt linkpop starpop stars there

Linda had been attracted most of all to John Lennon of the Beatles when she first saw them In person though she was charmed more by another Beatle Paul McCartney when they met McCartney was engaged to actress Jane Asher but she wanted to wait to have children and McCartney did not Their engagement ended McCartney loved to spend time with Lindas daughter Heather and the three of them seemed to make a family Linda and Heather moved into McCartneys home during 1968

Early in 1969 Linda became pregnant She and McCartney were married and had a baby the next year During this same time the Beatles were growing apart They had business problems and no longer had the same kinds of plans or hopes Linda hoped her father and brother whose clients were mostly entertainment personalities could help solve the business problems The fact that they were her family did not put the other Beatles at ease They chose Allen Klein to represent them instead Klein and the Eastmans did not get along and this caused further problems The Beatles began to break up late in 1969

Besides the bands problems Paul McCartney and John Lennon had grown apart personally Lennon divorced his first wife Cynthia in 1968 and started a relationship with Japanese artist Yoko Ono They were also married in 1969 Lennon and Ono spent as much time as possible together and McCartney often felt out of place McCartney and Linda also spent a lot of time together but separated to work on their own projects Linda and Yoko did not get along well but each supported their men and encouraged them to believe in themselves Later some fans blamed one or both women for breaking up the Beatles but their role was not crucial to that It was one of many factors that drove the band apart

Paul McCartney suffered from depression for a time when the Beatles ended It had been his longtime band made up of good friends and he had lost both He turned to his family for comfort Linda and their children were always there McCartney and Lennon argued in the media and Linda also took verbal jabs at Lennon and Yoko Ono Surprisingly when they met in person everyone usually acted in a completely different way and were kind to each other

Linda began to sing with her husband and to help him to write new songs He wanted her to do this and liked her input He also wanted to perform again for small audiences as the Beatles had done in their early days He taught Linda to play piano so she could share in the experience Linda did not become a virtuoso musician or singer but she added to the sound of McCartneys new band which he called Wings The couple enjoyed performing together as part of a band

Adding other musicians Wings began to play small shows sometimes turning up at a school or club in the morning and asking to play for no charge As they played more they began to give regular concerts and to go on tours The McCartneys would bring their children along during their school vacations The McCartney children did not realise their parents were celebrities and the family atmosphere between all of them was strong

Although now a musician Linda continued her photography and published books of her works She and McCartney also became vegetarians out of their love of animals Linda became a broken wikt linkcrusadercrusader for animal rights and related causes She learned and made recipes for vegetarian meals and began to write cookbooks

After Wings ended Linda still recorded and performed with her husband but she was now recognized as an activist for social causes and for charity work She launched a line of vegetarian frozen dinners They became popular and in time made Linda wealthy on her own Paul McCartney was knighted in 1997 and Linda was named Lady McCartney

In 1995 she was diagnosed with breast cancer which McCartneys mother died of in 1956 Medicine had advanced since that time but Linda died of breast cancer in 1998 at the Arizona ranch she owned with her husband A memorial service was held in London England and former Beatles George Harrison and Ringo Starr attended marking the last time they and Paul McCartney appeared and performed together in public

Pachycephalosaurus was a genus of ornithischian dinosaur which lived during the last five million years of the Upper Cretaceous It lived in what is now North America Pachycephalosaurus was a member of the Pachycephalosaurid family This dinosaur is only known from a single skull and a few extremely thick skull roofs From this it is estimated that its length was about 45 to 5 metres long It is the largest known pachycephalosaur

Scientists do not yet know for sure what these dinosaurs ate Having very small ridged teeth they could not have chewed tough fibrous plants as effectively as other dinosaurs of the same period It is assumed that pachycephalosaurs lived on a mixed diet of leaves seeds fruit and insects The sharp serrated teeth would have been very effective for shredding plants

The locomotion of Pachycephalosaurus might have included bipedal walking but this goes beyond the available evidence Only the skull is known

Gulag describes a vast network of slave labor camps operated by the Soviet Union from the 1930s to the 1950s From the time that the Soviet Union was founded in 1917 it imprisoned people who disagreed and spoke out against it This was in fact no different from what Imperial Russia did in previous decades with its katorga camps But the Soviet Union camp system eventually grew to be one of the biggest prison systems in existence

During the 1920s the Soviet Union imprisoned more and more people that disagreed with it It believed that it was better to put these people to work and make their labor and goods part of the national economy The Gulag system was officially created in 1930 During the 1930s there was a lot of fear of the Soviet government Police officials were encouraged to round up and imprison many citizens for the most trivial offenses even if they were innocent and this caused the Gulag system to swell By 1939 there were 13 million people in labor camps

Even though the Gulag is often associated with Siberia labor camps were located nationwide Siberian camps greatly simplified the problem of keeping prisoners from running away though it was harder to feed these camps and move goods in and out because of the vast distances involved

The Gulag system died during the 1950s after the death of Stalin and many people were released starting in 1954 The Gulag program was ended with a government decree in 1960

It is thought that as many as 20 million people had been in a Gulag camp at one time or another

In law negligence is a kind of lawsuit that people and organizations can bring if they are hurt It is a kind of tort The law calls someone negligent if he hurts someone else or someone elses property because he was not careful enough

In a case about legal negligence the person who brings the lawsuit is called the plaintiff and the person who is being sued is called the defendant The law about negligence is different in many places but for the plaintiff to win he or she usually has to prove at least four things

The defendants duty is what the law says that he or she has to do Usually the law says that people have to be reasonable That means they have to be careful use good judgment and not be unfair to other people In some cases the law tells people that they have special duties In other cases the law says that people have no duties at all For example in most places that use the common law a person has no legal duty to rescue another person from harm even if the rescue is very easy and does not cost anything or put anyone else in danger

When people do not follow their duty the law says that they breach their duty

A plaintiff can usually bring a lawsuit only if he or she has been hurt or has some other legal harm The law tells people what kinds of injuries people can sue about

A plaintiff can usually sue a defendant only if that defendant was the one who hurt the plaintiff In many cases it is easy to figure out who hurt someone But sometimes people get hurt in ways that nobody expects For example a defendant might be driving while drunk and he might hit an electric pole The electric pole could fall down and cause a neighborhood to lose electric power As a result a person two miles away might trip and fall in the dark The law will decide whether the drunk driver caused the person to trip and fall

The word negligence is sometimes used outside the law in a similar way It means that someone has not been careful enough

Cytokinesis is the division of cells after either Mitosis or Meiosis I and II

During Cytokinesis the cytoplasm splits into two equal halves a cleavage point appears and the cell becomes two daughter cells This occurs right after the beginning of anaphase and continues during telophase until the cell has completely divided and interphase has re started

In plants cytokinesis is slightly different As plant cells cannot move apart because of their rigid cell wall a cell plate begins to form during late anaphase and throughout telophase When the cytoplasm and organelles are divide evenly between the two new cells the plate then becomes less flimsy and soon becomes another rigid cell wall separating the daughter cells

There are many kinds of leukemia Leukemias are part of a bigger group of diseases the blood cancers 

Untreated leukemia will lead to death within weeks to months Chronic leukemias can last for years

Leukemia can be either acute or chronic Acute leukemia usually grows quickly Chronic leukemia usually grows slowly

Scelidosaurus was a genus of thyreophorans a lightly plated herbivorous dinosaur about 4 metres long It lived during the Lower Jurassic 208 to 194 million years ago Its fossils have been found in both England and in Arizona in the United States

Scelidosaurus has been called the earliest complete dinosaur This and related genera have been found on three continents

It is one of the earliest and most basal of the armoured dinosaurs A review by Serano placed Scelidosaurus as as the sister group to both the Stegosauria and Ankylosauria 

A full grown Scelidosaurus was rather small compared to most other dinosaurs Some scientists have estimated a length of 4 metres Scelidosaurus was quadrupedal with the hindlimbs considerably longer than the forelimbs It may have reared up on its hind legs to browse on foliage from trees but its forefeet were as large as its hind feet indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture 

Scelidosaurus and its Jurassic relatives were herbivorous However while other ornithischians had teeth capable of grinding plant material Scelidosaurus had smaller less complex teeth and a jaw capable of only simple up and down jaw movements In this aspect they resembled the stegosaurids which also bore primitive teeth and simple jaws Also like stegosaurs they may have swallowed gastroliths to aid processing of food in the same manner used by modern birds and crocodiles Their diet would have consisted of leaved plants or fruits as grasses did not evolve until after Scelidosaurus had become extinct

DNA repair means a collection of processes by which a cell identifies and corrects damage to the DNA molecules that encode its genome 

In human cells both normal metabolic activities and environmental factors such as UV light can cause DNA damage resulting in as many as 1 million individual molecular lesions per cell per day Many of these lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule and can alter or eliminate the cells ability to broken wikt linktranscribetranscribe the gene that the affected DNA encodes Other lesions induce potentially harmful mutations in the cells genome which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it undergoes mitosis Consequently the DNA repair process must be constantly active so it can respond rapidly to any damage in the DNA structure

The rate of DNA repair is dependent on many factors including the cell type the age of the cell and the extracellular environment

However no single haploid chromosome set defines even the DNA of a species because of the huge variety of alleles carried by a population Even a diploid individual carries genetic variety For that reason Dobzhansky preferred set of chromosomes and the definition now must be broader than Winklers definition The genome of a haploid chromosome set is merely a sample of the total genetic variety of a species

The term genome can be applied specifically to mean the complete set of nuclear DNA but can also be used of organelles that contain their own DNA as with the mitochondrial genome or the chloroplast genome

Atomic force microscopes are a type of microscope AFMs provide pictures of atoms on or in surfaces Like the Scanning Electron Microscope the purpose of the AFM is to look at objects on the atomic level In fact the AFM may be used to look at individual atoms It is commonly used in Nanotechnology

The AFM can do some things that the SEM cannot do The AFM can sometimes provide higher resolution than the SEM Further the AFM does not need to operate in a vacuum In fact the AFM can operate in ambient air or water so it can be used to see surfaces of biological samples like living cells

The AFM works by employing an ultra fine needle attached to a cantilever beam The tip of the needle runs over the ridges and valleys in the material being imaged feeling the surface As the tip moves up and down due to the surface the cantilever deflects In one basic configuration a laser shines on the cantilever at an oblique angle and allows for the direct measurement of the deflection in the cantilever by simply changing the angle of incidence for the laser beam In this way an image may be created revealing the configuration of the molecules being imaged by the machine 

There are many different operating modes for an AFM One is the contact mode where the tip is simply moved across the surface and the cantilever deflections are measured Another mode is called tapping mode because the tip is tapped against the surface as it travels along By controlling how hard the tip is tapped the AFM can move away from the surface when the needle feels a ridge so that it will not hit against the surface when it moves across This mode is also useful for biological samples because it is less likely to damage a soft surface These are the basic modes most commonly used however there are different names and methods such as intermittent contact mode non contact mode dynamic and static modes and more but are often variations on the above described tapping and contact modes

Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was the second president of Tunisia after Habib Bourguiba

Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was born in Hammam Sousse on September 9 1936

He was assigned to manage the Defense Military Security in 1964 and worked there until 1974 He was then promoted to director general of National Security at the Ministry of Interior in 1977 After that he was assigned to take care of relations between Tunisia and the Kingdom of Morocco After being the ambassador of Tunisia in Poland he returned to National Security

Right before becoming the President of Tunisian Republic Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has been promoted to Prime Minister and the constitutional successor on October 1 1987 Five weeks after his promotion he officially became the Second President of Tunisia

The way that Zine El Abidine Ben Ali governs had cause some problems with groups including the Al Jazeera channel Al Jazeera does not believe it is correct for Ben Ali to say that Muslim women wearing headscarves in public places must take then off and say that they will not wear them in public again

Heraldry is the art and science of designing and using a coat of arms The study of coats of arms is also called armory The practice of using distinct markings on a persons shield started in the Middle Ages when a knights helmet covered his face making everybody look the same in battle At first only knights and nobility had coats of arms but in the Middle Ages some cities started using heraldry too By the end of the Middle Ages other people began using coats of arms now called burgher arms which means they belong to a regular person and not a member of the nobility An official in charge of approving and recording coats of arms is called a herald The related study of flags is called vexillology

Heraldry is described in English using a specialised broken wikt linkjargonjargon called Blazon which is based on French words Heraldry uses only bold bright colors called tinctures with special names Gold for instance is called Or This word is often capitalised to distinguish it from the conjunction or Silver and white are sometimes treated as different colors but in English Blazon both are called argent Some combinations of colors represent furs and these have names that are only used in heraldry There are a number of geometric shapes called ordinaries that are used in heraldry and each of these has a special name too The shield may be divided in a number of ways usually following the lines of the ordinaries 

In the United Kingdom a baronet is a man who has the title Sir like a knight but who is neither

Unlike the members of the orders of chivalry and a knight bachelor a baronet can pass his title to his children

Baronets rank higher than knights but below barons

Some baronets were created in the 1300s but the modern Order of Baronets dates from King James I of England

On 22 May 1611 King James I set up the present hereditary Order of Baronets in  England He made 200 gentlemen of good birth baronets He did this partly to reward those people with more than a knighthood without making them as important as a Baron The other reason was that the king needed money to keep soldiers in Ireland Each of the new baronets had to pay 1095 which was the cost of keeping thirty soldiers for  three years

In 1619 James I set up the Baronetage of Ireland to raise more money

To explore Nova Scotia in what we now call Canada King was going a create the Baronetage of Nova Scotia in 1624 but he died that year His son King Charles I set up the Baronetage of Scotland and Nova Scotia in 1625  The new baronets had to pay 2000 or to support six settlers for two years 

Today over a hundred baronets of Nova Scotia still exist The Duke of Roxburghe who is also Baronet of Innes Ker of Innes is the Premier Baronet of Scotland because the baronetcy is the oldest one still existing in Scotand It was created in 1625

The Baronets of Nova Scotia were allowed to wear a badge from 1629 The design on the badge is the same as the flag of Nova Scotia

Baronets of England of Ireland of Great Britain or of the United Kingdom had no badge until 1929

The duchy of Saxe Coburg and Gotha was a dual monarchy in Germany This means that one ruler ruled over two countries In this case the duchies of Coburg and Gotha Saxe means of Saxony because there were a lot of different little countries but all were ruled by members of the royal house of Saxony Usually the royal house of Saxony means the rulers of the Kingdom of Saxony The house of Wettin is the rulers of the other states Wettin is the familys surname

The royal house of Saxe Coburg and Gotha was created in 1826 One dynasty of the House of Wettin became extinct because there were no more male children to inherit

The remaining members of the family divided their various lands between them The duke of Saxe Coburg Saalfeld gave up Saalfeld and instead got the duchy of Gotha Saalfeld became part of Saxe Meinigen which also took Hildburghausen when the Dule of Saxe Hildburghausen became Duke of Saxe Altenburg

On 12 November 1826 Ernst III of Saxe Coburg Saalfeld became Ernst I Duke of Saxe Coburg and Gotha Duke of Jlich Cleves and Berg also Engern and Westphalia Prince of Lichtenberg Landgrave in Thuringia Markgrave of Meien Count of Hennerberg Count of the Mark and Ravensburg Lord of Ravenstein and Tonna

Ernst had two sons His younger son Albert married his cousin Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom Saxe Coburg and Gotha was the name of the royal house of the United Kingdom until 1917 when the name was changed the Windsor because of hatred of anything German in World War I

Ernst I died in 1844 and his elder son and successor Ernst II ruled until he died in 1893 As he had no children childless the throne of the Duchy passed to the male descendants of Ernsts late brother Albert the Prince Consort husband of Queen Victoria But the Duchies did not want to be joined to Great Britain so their constitutions constitutions stopped the King and heir apparent of Great Britain from becoming Duke if other eligible male heirs exist Therefore after Edward Prince of Wales was his next brother Alfred Duke of Edinburgh Alfreds only son also named Alfred committed suicide in 1899 so when Duke Alfred died in 1900 he was succeeded by his nephew Charles Edward the Duke of Albany the sixteen year old son of Queen Victorias youngest son Leopold The new Duke started using the German version of his name and ruled as Duke Carl Eduard Until he came of age in 1905 the Hereditary Prince of Hohenlohe Langenburg acted as Regent Carl Eduard kept using his British title Duke of Albany but because he fought for Germany in the First World War he was stripped of his British titles in 1919

Carl Eduard reigned until 18 November 1918 when the Workers and Soldiers Council of Gotha deposed him during the German Revolution The two Duchies became separate states but soon joined bigger states Saxe Coburg became a part of Bavaria and Saxe Gotha merged with other small states to form the new state of Thuringia in 1920 in the Weimar Republic

The capitals of Saxe Coburg and Gotha were Coburg and Gotha By 1914 the area and populations of the two duchies were

Saxe Coburg and Gotha was the only European country to appoint a diplomatic consul to the Confederate States of America The consul was named Ernst Raven consul in the State of Texas When Raven asked the Confederate Government for a diplomatic exequatur on 20 July 1861 he was accepted

Other members of the family became kings of Belgium and Bulgaria and married into nearly all of the other royal families of Europe More than 50 years after Bulgaria became a republic King Simeon returned to Bulgaria and was elected Prime Minister After the First World War the Kings of Belgium stopped using the name Saxe Coburg and Gotha but never officially changed their name Simeon of Bulgarias legal name is Simeon Borisov Sakskoburggotski

The Duchy of Saxe Coburg and Gotha stopped being independent in 1918 when Germany became a republic Carl Eduard the last reigning duke had his British titles taken away for supporting Germany in World War I He died in 1954

Gotha became part of the new state of Thuringia and Coburg joined Bavaria

Edward Teach was a pirate often called Blackbeard the Pirate He attacked ships in the Caribbean and the American colonies

His best known ship was the Queen Annes Revenge which is thought to have run aground near Beaufort Inlet North Carolina in 1718

No one knows how many wives Blackbeard had The book A General History of the Pyrates says that he had as many as fourteen wives but he was not legally married to most of them

Blackbeard often fought wearing a big feathered tricorn hat and with lots of swords knives and pistols Some pictures show him with lighted rope matches woven into his enormous black beard during battle The marches burned slowly and gave of lots of smoke They were designed to make him look frightening  He probably got the idea from seeing the burning rope was used to light the gunpowder in cannons and guns

Blackbeard is thought to have been born in Bristol Teach went to sea when he was very young He served on an English ship in the War of the Spanish Succession privateering in the Spanish West Indies and along the Spanish Main At the wars end in 1713 Teach like many other privateers turned to piracy

Teach began as a pirate under Benjamin Hornigold In 1716 Hornigold retired taking advantage of an amnesty offered to former privateers by the British government Teach then took command of his own ship

During the next two years Blackbeard attacked merchant ships forcing them to allow his crew to board their ship The pirates would seize all of the valuables food liquor and weapons Ironically despite his ferocious reputation there are no verified accounts of him actually killing anyone

The governor of North Carolina sent two ships after Blackbeard The most complete account of the following events comes from the Boston News Letter 

Teach was said to have been shot five times and stabbed more than twenty times before he died and was decapitated Legends about his death immediately sprang up His headless body was thrown overboard but swam three times around the ship before sinking Teachs head was placed as a trophy on the bowsprit of the ship Captain Maynard had to keep the head to claim his prize when he returned home Later Teachs head hung from a pike in Bath Somerset

 Bah

Siyyid Al Muammad was a merchant from Shrz Iran who started a religion called Bbism After he started the religion he changed his name to Bb People who believe in the Bb are called Bbs and they believe that the Bb was a prophet Bbs also believe that the Bb is the Qim that Shias believe will come in the future The Bb wrote hundreds of letters and books teaching who he was and what the rules of his religion were The Bbs new rules replaced the Shariah or Muslim rules for his followers Bbism became very large over ten thousand people believed in the Bb The Shia clergy or leaders of Islam in Iran hated the Bb and tried to harm people who followed his religion In 1850 a firing squad or group of gunmen shot the Bb in Tabrz Iran

The Bb had other names for example the Primal Point and the Point of the Bayn

The Bb told everyone that another prophet who was stronger and even more powerful was coming soon People who follow the Bah religion believe the Bb was talking about Bahullh who started the Bah religion

The Bb was born on October 20 1819 in Shiraz Iran His father was a merchant and many people in the town knew him Very soon after the Bb was born his father died The Bbs uncle j Mrz Siyyid Al was also a merchant and he raised the Bb

When the Bb became a man he started working as a merchant with his uncle In 1842 he married a woman named Khadjih Bagum Together they had one son who they named Amad Amad was very sick and died when as a baby Someone who lived at the same time as the Bb said he was very calm and quiet they said the Bb only spoke who he had too and did not even answer questions The Bb was always thinking and praying People said he was handsome and had a thin beard He always dressed in clean clothes and wore a green scarf and a black turban or wrap of cloth on his head

Shaykh Ahmad i Ahsai started a Shia Islam religious group in Persia in the 1790s The member of the group who were called Shaykhis believes that god was sending a new messenger to earth very soon They called the new messenger the Qim or theMahdi When Shaykh Ahmad died Siyyid Kzim who was from Rasht Iran became the new leader of the Shaykhis Shaykh Ahmad lived was born in 1753 and he died in 1862 Siyyid Kzim was born in 1793 and he died in 1843

When the Bb went on a pilgrimage to Karbala and the places near it he may have listened to Siyyid Kzim teach Nobody knows for sure if he did or did not because there are very few documents or records from that time

When Siyyid Kzim was dying in December he told all his followerspeople who believe what he taughtthat they should travel and try to find the new prophet from god He called that prophet The Lord of the Age and told them that he would be discovered very soon One of the people who believed Siyyid Kzim prayed and fasted or stopped eating from dawn to dusk for forty days  his name was Mull usayn After that he travelled to Shiraz and he met the Bb

Mull usayn got to Shiraz on May 23 1844 A young man wearing a green turban greeted him after he had not been in Shiraz for very long In Iran at that time only people who were related to the prophet Muammad wore green turbans Men who were related to the prophet Muammad were called Siyyids The young man was the Bb and he invited Mull usayn to his home

The Bb asked Mull usayn why he was in Shiraz and Mull usayn told him that he was searching for the new prophet or Promised One The Bb asked Mull usayn how he would know who the prophet way Mull usayn told him that the prophet would come from a famous and good family and would know many things without having to learn them also that he would have no problems with his body Then the Bb said that all of those things were true about himself Behold all these signs are manifest in me The Bb was saying that he was the new prophet Mull usayn had been looking for This shocked or startled Mull usayn

Mull usayn had one more way to know who the new prophet was and he had not told the Bb about Siyyid Kim had told Mull usayn that the new prophet would write a book explaining the Surih of Joseph Siyyid Kim had also said that the new prophet would do this without anyone asking him to After the Bb told Mull usayn that he was the new prophet he wrote a book about the Surih of Joseph The Bb called that book the Qayymul Asm

After spending the night talking to the Bb Mull Husayn said this

Mull usayn was the Bbs first disciple A student of a religious leader is called a disciple In less than five months seventeen more students of Siyyid Kim became disciples of the Bb All of the new disciples started believing the Bb was a new manifestation or prophet of god without anyone elses help One of these new disciples was a woman Her name was Zarrn Tj Baraghni and she was a poet Later she was given a new namehirih Later people started calling the first eighteen disciples and the Bb the Letters of the Living The Bb told the Letters of the Living that it was their job to tell people that he was the new prophet

The Bb said that the Letters of the Living were special In Shia Islam there are fourteen special people called the Infallibles Shias believe the Infallibles are always right Muhammad the twelve Imms and Fatimah are the Infallibles in Shia Islam Just like the Infallibles one of the letters of the Living was a woman and one was a prophet Nineteen was a special number in Bbism The Letters of the Living were very much like the Twelve Apostles of Christ

Mescaline is a chemical substance It occurs naturally in some cactuses like the Peyote cactusthe Peruvian Torch cactus or the San Pedro cactus Small amounts of it can also be found in certain members of the Fabaceae family like Acacia berlandieri 

The chemical can cause hallucinations In has been used as a drug in Native American religious ceremonies It is illegal in many countries Some people use it as an illegal drug

Psilocybin is a chemical substance It can cause hallucinations It occurs in many kind of fungi and mushrooms most notably Psilocybin mushrooms Most of these are known as psychedelic mushrooms 

The substance is used as a recreational drug It is illegal in many countries

Ketamine is an anesthetic It causes a so called dissociative analgesia which means that it has a high analgesic effect but a minor hypnotic so treated people can be nearly awake but without feeling pain Sometimes it can lead to hallucinations That is why some people use it as a recreational drug As it can have severe side effects it is usually not available as an over the counter drug For many years Ketamine had been available just as an racemic mixture The new Enantiomer Esketamin has much fewer of these side effects A prescription is needed to get it

Diazepam is a drug It is a benzodiazepine which has a relatively long half life It is mostly used to treat anxiety certain forms of epilepsy and sleeping problems Like with other benzodiazepines there is a risk of addiction For this reason the drug is used to treat acute cases It should not be taken for longer than a few weeks According to the World Health Organization diazepam is an essential drug

Non sovereign states dependencies of members of the Commonwealth

Ascension Island is an island in the South Atlantic Ocean It is about convert1600kmabbron from the coast of Africa It is a dependency of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena which is convert1287kmsigfig1abbron to the southeast The island is named after the day of its discovery Ascension Day

On the island is Wideawake Airfield which run by the Royal Air Force and the United States Air Force

The Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands is two groups of small low lying uninhabited tropical islands in the Indian Ocean north west of Australia and south of the Indonesian island of Roti

The territory includes Ashmore Reef and Cartier Island convert70kmmisigfig1 east with a total area of convert19945km2mi2sigfig3 within the reefs and including the lagoons and convert114400mi2sqftsigfig2 of dry land They have a long coastline over convert74kmmisigfig2 but there are no ports or harbours only offshore anchorage Nearby Hibernia Reef convert42kmmisigfig2 northeast of Ashmore Reef is not part of the territory because it has no permanently dry land area although large parts of the reef become exposed during low tide

The territory is administered from Canberra by the Australian Department of the Environment and Heritage Therefore it is a dependency within the commonwealth The islands are visited by seasonal caretakers

The Australian Antarctic Territory is the part of Antarctica claimed by Australia and is the largest part of Antarctica claimed by any nation The area is about 6119818 km Only the staff of research stations live in the territory

Victoria Land was first claimed for Britain on 9 January 1841 and Britain claimed Enderby Land in 1930 In 1933 a British imperial order transferred territory south of 60 S and between meridians 160 E and 45 E to Australia On 13 February 1954 Mawson Station was set up It was the first Australian station on the continent proper 

Australias claim to sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory is recognised by the United Kingdom New Zealand France and Norway As Australia is part of the Antarctic Treaty System which accommodates differences of opinions over the status of Antarctic territorial claims which pre dated the 1959 Antarctic Treaty  effectively placing claims in abeyance  Australia only exercises its sovereignty in ways that in its view are consistent with good relations under the Antarctic Treaty

Australia issues postage stamps for the Australian Antarctic Territory The first issues came in 1957 and sporadically thereafter settling into a pattern of an annual issue by the 1990s All have been Antarctic themed and all are valid for postage in Australia so in practice they are just Australian stamps with a different inscription

Assigned the country calling code 672 four Antarctic bases operated by Australia can be reached by direct calling from anywhere in the world The area codes are 10 6 for Davis 11 7 for Mawson 12 8 for Casey and 13 9 for Macquarie Island in each case followed by three additional digits

The British Antarctic Territory is a sector of Antarctica claimed by the United Kingdom and is a British overseas territory It is a triangle in Antarctica from the South Pole to 60 S latitude between longitudes 20 W and 80 W The Territory was formed on March 3 1962 although the UK first claimed this part of the Antarctic in 1908 Before 1962 the area now covered by the Territory comprised three separate dependencies of the Falkland Islands 

The Territory overlaps other claims on Antarctica by Argentina and Chile

The Territory is inhabited largely by the staff of research and support stations operated and maintained by the British Antarctic Survey and other organisations

The United Kingdom has had a presence in the South Atlantic since 1833 when it occupied the Falkland Islands In 1908 the UK claimed the territory that is British Antarctic Territory today as well as South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands The territory was governed as three separate dependencies Graham Land the South Orkneys and the South Shetlands administered from Falkland Islands by the Governor

In addition to continental Antarctica within which the BAT claim includes the Palmer Land peninsula and the Ronne Ice Shelf Weddell Sea the territory also includes the South Shetland Islands and South Orkney Islands

It is administered by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office A Commissioner is appointed and is always the Head of the FCOs Overseas Territories Department 

The Territory has a full suite of laws and legal and postal administrations Given the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty System the Territory does not enforce its laws on foreign nations who maintain scientific bases within the Territory It is self financing with income from the sale of postage stamps and income tax

The British Antarctic Survey has three permanently staffed research stations in the Territory

The British Indian Ocean Territory is a dependency of the United Kingdom It includes many small islands in the Indian Ocean The largest island is Diego Garcia However India claims the territories and does not recognise its authority over the Chagos Archipelago

Like many other peoples throughout history around the world the natives of these islands were forcefully deported by the British government This happened in 1967 to allow the United States to rent them for a military base In 2000 the High Court of the UK first ruled that the natives had the right to return home but the government have been fighting hard against this court decision and the natives are still now trying to move back to the islands

The Territory of Christmas Island is a small island that belongs to Australia It is in the Indian Ocean 2600 kms northwest of Perth in Western Australia and 500 km south of Jakarta Indonesia 

About 1600 people live on Christmas Island mostly in a number of settlement areas on the north of the island 

Christmas Island is a long distance from other islands which is why many of the plants and animals are only found on that Island Much of it is undisturbed by humans 

There used to be mining on the island but now 65 of Christmas Island is National Park 

Captain William Mynors of the British East India Company ship the Royal Mary gave the island its name because they arrived on Christmas Day 25 December 1643 

The earliest recorded visit was in March 1688 by William Dampier of the British ship Cygnet Dampier was blown away from the direction he wanted to go and he got lost After 28 days he arrived on Christmas Island Two of his crewmen were the first recorded people to set foot on Christmas Island

There were several visits and explorations of the island but it was only when valuable phosphate of lime was discovered that the island was annexed to the British Crown on 6 June 1888

Soon afterwards a small settlement was started in Flying Fish Cove by G Clunies Ross the owner of the Keeling Islands to collect timber and supplies for the growing industry on Cocos

Phosphate mining began in the 1890s using indentured workers from Singapore China and Malaysia

The island was ruled jointly by the British Phosphate Commissioners and District Officers from the United Kingdom Colonial Office through the Straits Settlements and later the Crown Colony of Singapore 

Japan invaded and occupied the island in 1942 as the Indian garrison mutinied and they interned the residents until the end of World War II in 1945 

Australia asked the United Kingdom to allow them to rule the island in 1957 the Australian government paid the government of Singapore 29 million in compensation This amount of money was decided by guessing how much the phosphate given up by Singapore was worth

The first Australian Official Representative arrived in 1958 and was replaced by an Administrator in 1968 Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands together are called the Australian Indian Ocean Territories and since 1997 share one Administrator who lives on Christmas Island

Since the late 1980s boatloads of refugees have gone to Christmas Island mostly from Indonesia During 2001 Christmas Island received a large number of asylum seekers travelling by boat most of them from the Middle East and intending to apply for asylum in Australia The Norwegian cargo vessel MV Tampa rescued people from a sinking Indonesian fishing boat Palapa The ship had 420 asylum seekers from Afghanistan 13 from Sri Lanka and five from Indonesia The captain of the ship asked to let the refugees leave the ship at Christmas Island The Australian SAS boarded and took control The asylum seekers were sent to Nauru Another boatload of asylum seekers was taken from Christmas Island to Papua New Guinea It was said that many of the adult asylum seekers threw their children into the water in protest at being turned away This was later proved to be untrue Many of the refugees were accepted by New Zealand 

The Australian Parliament later passed a law to ban people who arrive on Christmas Island from being able automatically to claim refugee status This allows the Australian navy to move them to other countries In 2005 the Department of Immigration began to build an Immigration Reception and Processing Centre due for completion in late 2007 The facility will probably cost 210 million and will have 800 beds

Christmas Island is a non self governing territory of Australia The Queen of Australiais represented by an administrator appointed by the Governor General Neil Lucas was appointed administrator on 28 January 2006

Federal government services are provided through the Department of Transport and Regional Services and the Christmas Island Administration 

The Western Australian Government and other contractors provide state government services but because Christmas Island is a territory the Commonwealth Australian Government pay the costs 

The local government is the Shire of Christmas Island This council has 9 members half the members are elected every two years

Christmas Island residents who are Australian citizens also vote in Commonwealth elections for the Northern Territorys Lingiari constituency of the House of Representatives They are represented in the Senate by Northern Territory Senators 

In early 1986 the Christmas Island Assembly held a design competition for an island flag the winning design was adopted as the informal flag of the territory for more than ten years and in 2002 it was made the official flag of Christmas Island

The annual red crab mass migration to the sea to spawn has been called one of the wonders of the natural world and takes place each year around November after the start of the wet season and in synchronisation with the cycle of the moon 

The Christmas Island National Park covers 63 of the island This means that for the visitor interested in plants and animals there is a great deal to see There is also lots of amazing marine life in the sea

The Territory of Cocos Islands also called Cocos Islands and Keeling Islands is a territory of Australia There are two atolls and twenty seven coral islands in the group The islands are located in the Indian Ocean about one half of the way from Australia to Sri Lanka 

Captain William Keeling was the first European to see the islands in 1609 but they remained uninhabited until the nineteenth century when they became a possession of the Clunies Ross Family Slaves were brought to work the coconut plantation from Indonesia the Cape of Good Hope and East Asia by Alexander Hare who had taken part in Stamford Raffles takeover of Java in 1811 A Scottish merchant seaman called Captain John Clunies Ross who had also served under Raffles in the takeover set up a compound and Hares severely mistreated slaves soon escaped to work under better conditions for Clunies Ross 

On November 23 1955 the islands were transferred to Australian control under the Cocos Islands Act 1955 In the 1970s Australian government dissatisfaction with the Clunies Ross feudal style of rule of the island increased In 1978 Australia forced the family to sell the islands for the sum of AU6250000 using the threat of compulsory purchase By agreement the family retained ownership of Oceania House their home on the island However in 1983 the Australian government moved to dishonour this agreement and told the former last ruler John Clunies Ross that he should leave the Cocos The following year the High Court of Australia ruled that the government could not buy Oceania House Instead the Australian government ordered that no government business was to be given to his shipping company an action which contributed to his bankruptcy John Clunies Ross lives in exile in Perth Australia but his successors still live on the Cocos

In 2004 there were 629 people living on the Cocos islands There are about 120 Europeans on West Island and 500 Malays on Home Island A Cocos dialect of Malay and English are the main languages spoken and 80 of Cocos Islanders are Sunni Muslim India does not recognise Anglo annexation of these Cultural Indo IndianIndies islands as part of Australia and disputes its status to counter balance regional hegemonic sea power factdateJuly 2010

Heard Island and McDonald Islands are islands in the Southern Ocean about two thirds of the way from Madagascar to Antarctica They are south of Rajapur MaharashtraIndia and nobody lives on these islands The islands were discovered in 1833 by the British sailor Peter Kemp They have been territories of Australia since 1947 and contain the only two active volcanoes in Australian territory one of which Mawson Peak is the highest Australian mountain The groups size is 372 km in area

The Ross Dependency is an area of Antarctica claimed by New Zealand The Dependency takes its name from Sir James Clark Ross who discovered the Ross Sea

The Dependency includes part of Victoria Land and most of the Ross Ice Shelf Ross Island Balleny Islands and the small Scott Island also form part of the Dependency as does the ice covered Roosevelt Island

The scientific bases of Scott Base and McMurdo Station are the only permanently occupied human settlements in the area apart from the Amundsen Scott South Pole Station at the very edge of the territory The Dependency has a snow runway at Williams Field and depending on conditions and time of year two ice runways This guarantees accessibility by wheeled and ski equipped aircraft year round

The British government took possession of the territory in 1923 and entrusted it to the administration of New Zealand Under the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty System to which New Zealand is a signatory no nation may make efforts to enforce sovereignty or territorial claims over the Antarctic continent proper If one accepts the claim the Ross Dependency comprises the bulk of the territory of New Zealand far larger than the North Island and the South Island combined However the actual amount of land mass claimed is not large most of the area defined as being in the Ross Dependency is either in the Ross Sea or the Antarctic Ocean It is the smallest of the claims which were made prior to the implementation of the Antarctic Treaty System and the suspension of all territorial claims to Antarctica proper

The Governor General of New Zealand is also the Governor of Ross Dependency Officers of the Government of the Ross Dependency are annually appointed to run the Dependency

In the late 1980s the British non governmental exploratory vessel Southern Quest sank in the Ross Sea United States Coast Guard helicopters rescued the crew who were taken to McMurdo Station 

Tristan da Cunha is a group of remote islands in the south Atlantic Ocean 2816 km from South Africa and 3360 km from South America It is a dependency of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena 2173 km to the north The territory consists of the main island Tristan da Cunha as well as several uninhabited islands Inaccessible Island and the Nightingale Islands Gough Island situated 395 km south east of the main island is also part of the territory

A frozen dinner is a kind of broken wikt linkprepackageprepackaged meal or convenience food Frozen dinners are prepared in bulk cooked until ready to serve then divided into single servings and frozen to be reheated later An entre of meat or other protein is included along with vegetables a carbohydrate food and a sweet dessert

Frozen dinners are helpful for persons who do not have time to cook or who lack meal planning or cooking skills They are also known as TV dinners because they were long advertised as suitable to warm up and eat while watching television Both inventions became popular at around the same time and each one sold more of the other

For many years frozen dinners came packaged with a shaped broken wikt linkaluminium foilaluminum foil tray This made them easy to reheat in a normal gas or electric stoves oven The trays were sometimes reused or recycled by users When microwave ovens became common frozen dinners could not be cooked in them because the metal tray would damage the oven Early packaged foods for the microwave often could not be cooked in a regular oven because the heat would make the package catch fire or fall apart New packaging had to be developed so the same frozen dinner could be heated in both kinds of ovens This succeeded during the 1980s Some new trays can be reused while others are made of paper and meant to be thrown away

The quality of food in frozen dinners has also improved steadily through the years Early potato dishes would sometimes have a chalk like quality to them and vegetables poor texture Newer dinners taste much more like they are freshly cooked Vegetarian meals have also been introduced Linda McCartney started a popular line of frozen vegetarian dishes during the 1990s

A Tumulus is a certain type of grave The word comes from Latin This way of burying people was common in the Stone age Bronze age and Iron age There are different layouts Sometimes sarcophaguses were used at other times urns were placed in the grave There are layouts with one or with multiple chambers Sometimes the location is privileged and stone circles can be found nearby

Zapotec could mean

The Zapotec civilization was an indigenous pre Columbian civilization It was mainly in the Valley of Oaxaca of southern Mesoamerica Archaeologists think their culture goes back at least 2500 years The Zapotec left traces at the ancient city of Monte Albn There are buildings ball courts magnificent tombs and grave goods In the graves finely worked gold jewellery was found Monte Albn was the first major city in the western hemisphere It was the center of a Zapotec state that dominated much of what we know of as the current state of Oaxaca

The name Zapotec comes from Nahuatl tzapotcah This word means inhabitants of the place of sapote The Zapotec referred to themselves as Beenaa which means The People 

The Zapotec developed a calendar and a special system of writing This system has a separate glyph for each of the syllables of the language It is one of several candidates thought to have been the first writings system of Mesoamerica It is the predecessor of the writing systems developed by the Maya Mixtec and Aztec civilizations Currently there is some debate if Olmec symbols dated to 650 BC are actually a form of writing which is older than the earliest Zapotec writing dated to about 500 BC

In the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan there were Zapotec and Mixtec artisans who made jewellery for the Aztec rulers including Moctezuma II Relations with central Mexico go back much further This can be proven by archaeological remains of a Zapotec neighborhood within Teotihuacan and a Teotihuacan style guest house in Monte Albn Other important pre Columbian Zapotec sites include Lambityeco Dainzu Mitla Yagul San Jos Mogote El Palmillo and Zaachila

The Zapotec were a sedentary culture They were a well advanced in civilization living in large villages and towns in houses constructed with stone and mortar They recorded the principal events in their history by means of hieroglyphics and in warfare they made use of a cotton armour The well known ruins of Mitla have been attributed to them and were claimed to be the tombs of their ancestors

Like most Mesoamerican religious systems the Zapotec religion was polytheistic Two principal deities include Cocijo the rain god and Coquihani the god of light It is believed that the Zapotec sometimes used human sacrifice in their rituals

The Zapotecs tell that their ancestors emerged from the earth from caves or that they turned from trees or jaguars into people while the elite that governed them believed that they descended from supernatural beings that lived among the clouds and that upon death they would return to such status In fact the name by which Zapotecs are known today resulted from this belief In Central Valley Zapotec The Cloud People is Beena Zaa

The last battle between the Aztecs and the Zapotecs occurred between 1497 and 1502 under the Aztec ruler Ahuizotl At the time of Spanish conquest of Mexico when news arrived that the Aztecs were defeated by the Spaniards King Cosijoeza ordered his people not to confront the Spaniards so they would avoid the same fate They were defeated by the Spaniards only after several campaigns between 1522 and 1527 However uprisings against colonial authorities occurred in 1550 1560 and 1715FactdateAugust 2007 

In 1850 there was another rebellion against the local government of Oaxaca followed in 1866 by one against the Royal French Army during the French invasion of Mexico In recent times there was an uprising against the local governor Manuel Zrate Aquino in the 1970s supported by the Mexican ArmyFactdateAugust 2007

The Olmec were a people who lived about 3000 years ago in what is today south central Mexico The Olmec were the first civilization in the ancient area known as Mesoamerica Because they were the first civilization many later Mesoamerican civilizations used and repeated Olmec features and characteristics The Olmec people discovered and made use of many natural resources in the area including rubber and corn Dozens of mysterious stone heads were discovered in the Olmec territory as well archaeologists are still not sure what their purposes were

The Olmecs lived from 1200 BC to about 400 BC They had two important cities first San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan and then La Venta The Olmecs were able to thrive due to the fertile land around the Coatzacoalcos river basin The reason for the fall of the Olmec empire is unknown

While the Olmecs are most famous for their colossal stone heads they also created a range of other artwork such as altars Jade masks and stone carvings

The Olmec colossal heads are the most recognized symbol of the Olmec civilization The height and weights of the heads vary but the largest head is about twice the height of an average human male They include seventeen heads found in the southern Mexican cities of La Venta San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan Tres Zapotes and Rancho la Cobata Each head shows a unique facial expression and wears a helmet bearing distinctive decorations No two are alike The origins and meaning of the heads remain mysterious and they are the subject of much speculation among scholars and archaeologists

Scholars have tried to explain for instance how the Olmecs might have made and moved such big objects The heads were sculpted out of a hard dense rock called basalt Archaeologists theorize that the Olmecs found the majority of the basalt in the Tuxtlas Mountain range According to this theory the basalt heads were sculpted roughly in the mountains and then either floated or dragged by thousands of people from the construction site to the Olmecs central cities 

Perhaps the most notable features of the sculpturesand a clue as to their meaningare the helmets worn by all the Olmec heads These helmets together with rubber balls found near the sculptures may be evidence that the Mesoamerican ball game originated with the Olmec civilization The Mesoamerican ball game was a team sport with profound religious and cultural significance for the indigenous people of Mexico and Central America The Olmec heads were once thought to have represented Mesoamerican ball players who were sacrificed after losing a match The current theory however is that the heads honor Olmec rulers It is unknown whether these rulers are meant to be dressed as ball players

Baron Edouard Louis Joseph Merckx is a former Belgian professional cyclist Merckx regarded as the greatest and most successful cyclist of all time established several world cycling records some of which remain unbroken to this day

Merckx started competing in 1961 Three years later he became Amateur World Champion He turned professional in 1965 In 1966 he won the first of seven editions of Milan Sanremo He started his first grand tour at the 1967 Giro dItalia He won his first stage here and finished seventh overall Later that year he outsprinted Jan Janssen to become Professional World Champion at Heerlen The Netherlands He was world champion twice more 

In 1968 Merckx moved to the Italian Faema team As world champion he wore the rainbow jersey and won the Paris Roubaix race for the first time He also won the Giro dItalia He won the Giro three more times

Starting the 1969 season he won Paris Nice stage race In the time trial he overtook the five time Tour de France winner Jacques Anquetil Anquetil was so good at time trailing many people thought he was unbeatable Merckx went on to win Milan Sanremo and Ronde van Vlaanderen several weeks later 

In his Tour de France debut in 1969 Merckx immediately won the yellow jersey the green jersey and the red polka dotted jersey No other cyclist has won the three jerseys in one Tour de France and only Tony Romingerin 1993 and Laurent Jalabert in 1995 have been able to match this feat in any Grand Tour Both were in the Tour of Spain Merckx was only 24 so would have won the white jersey but the Tour de France did not give a white jersey until the 1970s

Eddy Merkx was the first Belgian to win the Tour de France since Sylvre Maes in 1939 Merckx became a national hero He won the Tour four more times in 1970 1971 1972 and 1974 equalling Jacques Anquetil Over the next 25 years only Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain were able to equal the five victories Then Lance Armstrong won the Tour a sixth and a seventh time Merckx still holds the records for stage wins and number of days in the Yellow Jersey

The greatest challenge to Merckx was in the 1971 Tour de France Luis Ocana attacked and won the maillot jaune by several minutes Ocana held his lead until he crashed and had to abandon the tour Many people hoped they would race against each other againof a rematch between the two 

Before that could happen Merckx raced in the 1972 edition of the Giro dItalia and beat the mountain racing expert Jose Manuel Fuente in the mountain stages In that years Tour de France Ocana was sick and withdrew 

In 1973 Merckx rode in the Vuelta a Espaa where he beat Luis Ocana and Bernard Thvenet and then went on to win the Giro dItalia Merckxs final victory in the Giro dItalia in the 1974 edition was a tight battle between Merckx and two Italians In the end Merckx won by the very narrow margin of twelve seconds over Gianbattista Baronchelli and 33 seconds over Felice Gimondi

In addition to Grand Tour successes Merckx has a long list of victories in one day races Among the highlights are 

That is a total of 19 victories in the Classics He also won the World Road Racing Championship a record three times in 1967 1971 and 1974 and every Classic except Paris Tours Finally he won 17 six day track races often with Patrick Sercu

Merckx retired from racing in 1978 at the age of 33

The blackest day in Merckxs career was in 1969 when he crashed in a derny race towards the end of the season A pacer and a cyclist fell in front of Merckxs pacer Fernand Wambst Wambst and Merckx crashed Wambst was killed instantly and Merckx suffered concussion and fell unconscious This accident cracked a vertebra and twisted his pelvis Afterwards he said his riding was never the same because he always be in pain especially while climbing

That same year during the Giro dItalia was found to have used drugs and disqualified He cried in front of reporters and still protests his innocence He argued that there were no counter experts nor counter analysis and that foreign supporters hated him Further he stated that the stage during which he was allegedly using drugs was an easy one so there was no need to use drugs The Belgian prince sent a plane to bring him to Belgium This incident was one of the reasons why Merckx thought his first Tour de France victory later that year his best ever win

The end of his Tour career came in 1975 That year he attempted to win his sixth but became a victim of violence Many Frenchmen were upset that a Belgian might beat the record five wins set by Jacques Anquetil Merckx held the yellow jersey for eight days which raised his record to 96 days but during stage 14 a French spectator punched him in the liver A later collision with the Danish rider Ole Ritter broke his jaw Although he could not eat solid food and was barely able to talk Merckx did not retire During the last stage he attacked leader Bernard Thevenet 

Merckx set these records during his career 

Merckx set the hour record in 25 October 1972 He covered 49431 km at high altitude in Mexico City The record was unbeaten until 1984 when Francesco Moser broke it using a specially designed bicycle During the next 15 years various racers improved the record to more than 56 km However because of the more and more strange designs of the bikes and position of the rider in 2000 the UCI said a traditional bike must be used When Chris Boardman had another go at Merckxs reinstated record in 2000 he beat it by slightly more than 10 metres at sea level But Merckx had raced a full road season winning the Tour Giro and four Classics while Boardman was a time trial specialist who had retired from road racing and had prepared specially for the 2000 Hour Record

Having retired Merckx has a bicycle factory and is a race commentator He was coach of the Belgian national cycling team during the mid 90s and part of the Belgian Olympic Committee Merckx is still asked to comment as an authority on cycling As such he has also figured as special advisor for the recent UCI addition Tour of Qatar since 2002

In May 2004 he underwent an oesophagus operation to cure the constant stomach ache which he suffered since he was a young man He lost almost 30 kg in the process and started cycling again but only for leisure

In 1967 Merckx married Claudine Acou Merckxs mother asked the priest to celebrate the ceremony in French a choice that ended up being a contentious issue in Belgium They had two children a daughter and a son Axel who was a professional cyclist for Team T Mobile 

Despite this early incident Merckx is a perfect ambassador to Belgium Because of this he came 4th in the Walloon version of the Greatest Belgian contest in 2005 and third in the Flemish version

In 1996 the Belgian king gave him the title of baron In 2000 he was chosen Belgian Sports Figure of the Century

Merckx is known as a quiet and modest person Many of his former helpers have worked in his bicycle factory and join him during recreational bike tours

Merckx has condemned doping At the same time he has been quick to point out that cycling is unfairly treated when compared to other sports In the 1990s he became a friend of Lance Armstrong and supported him when he was accused of drug use stating he believed what Lance told him than what appeared in newspapers After Armstrong won his third Tour de France Merckx predicted he would go on to win as many as seven

Merckx twice tested positive for doping in his career Because he has admitted doing this publicly the city of Stuttgart Germany did not want to invite him to the world cycling championships being held in the city in 2007 

Monstera is a genus of flowering plants There are about 60 species in the genus The genus belongs to the family Araceae Originally the plants occur in the tropical regions of Central and South America 

The plants are herbs or evergreen vines They climb other trees They can grow to a height of about 20m The plants also have aerial roots These can act as hooks on branches of the tree that the plant is climbing They grow down into the ground to support the plant The leaves are leather dark green and often have holes in them The flowers grow on a special inflorescence called a spadix  Some species have edible fruit

Many people grow some of these species indoors as a houseplant Monstera deliciosa is sometimes also grown for its fruit which tastes somewhere between a banana and a pineapple

In some parts of the world some plants started to grow in the wild This is the case for example in Portugal on Madeira Morocco some parts of India and Malaysia as well as in Florida

A vine is any plant of the genus Vitis These plants make berries which can be made into wine These plants are different from other plants They have special ways to climb structures like trees Therefore Vine often refers to such climbing plants Sometimes such plants are referred to as Climber Ivy or Liana are examples of such plants

Aerial roots are roots that are above ground Different plants have grown them They can serve different purposes

Tropical waves or easterly waves also known as African easterly waves in the Atlantic Ocean are a type of atmospheric trough an extended area of moderately low air pressure leaning north to south which move from east to west across the tropics creating areas of cloudiness and thunderstorms West moving waves can also form from the tail end of frontal zones in the subtropics and tropics and may be called to as easterly waves but these waves are not properly called tropical waves they are a form of inverted trough sharing many characteristics with fully tropical waves All tropical waves form in the easterly flow along the southern side of the subtropical ridge or belt of high pressure which is located north and south of the Intertropical Convergence Zone Tropical waves are normally carried westward by the prevailing easterly winds along the tropics and subtropics near the equator They can lead to the formation of tropical cyclones in the north Atlantic and northeast Pacific Oceans

A tropical wave is usually preceded by an area of sinking intensely dry air sloping as a northeast wind With the passage of the trough line the wind turns to the southeast the humidity suddenly rises and the atmosphere destabilizes producing widespread showers and thunderstorms sometimes severe As the wave moves off westward the showers slowly stop

A notable exception to the general characteristic of widespread precipitation behind a tropical wave occurs in the Atlantic Periodically a surge of intensely dry air known as the Saharan Air Layer is entrained behind a tropical wave resulting in cloudless or nearly cloudless skies as convection is limited by the dry layer inversion Also any dust which may be present within the SAL reflects solar radiation slightly cooling the atmosphere below it

Tropical waves in the Atlantic Ocean form from disturbances which drift off the continent of Africa onto the Atlantic Ocean These are generated or enhanced by the African Easterly Jet The clockwise circulation of the large transoceanic high pressure cell or anticyclone centered near the Azores islands impels easterly waves away from the coastal areas of Africa to North America Approximately 60 of Atlantic tropical cyclones originally form from tropical waves while approximately 85 of intense Atlantic hurricanes form from tropical waves

Tropical cyclones can sometimes degenerate back into a tropical wave This normally happens if upper level wind shear is too strong The storm can redevelop if the upper level shear decreases or stops If a tropical wave is moving quickly it can have strong winds of over tropical storm force but is not considered a tropical storm unless it has a closed circulation

It has been suggested that eastern Pacific Ocean tropical cyclones are formed out of tropical waves that come from North Africa as well During the summer months tropical waves can go northward as far as the desert southwest of the United States producing spells of intensified shower activity surrounded within the current monsoon area

A cable is made of many wires or optical fibers twisted together to make a larger wire Each of these wires may be covered Some cables contain both electrical wires and optical fibers There are many kinds of cables including coaxial cables which block out radio or magnetic interference from other wires or cables by having one wire inside an insulated tube surrounded by a second wire acting as a metal tube along the same axis

Electrical cables are usually made of copper because electricity moves well through copper but it is not as expensive as silver or other better conductors Cables are sometimes made of aluminium because it is cheaper than copper

The word cable is also used as ellipsis or a short form for cable TV A cable car is a trolley which uses a cable wire above the track

The Yellow jersey is the jersey worn by the leader of many multi day bicycle races originally and most notably the Tour de France It allows the rider who was in the overall lead at the end of the previous day to be easily identified

Because the Tour de France was the first to use a coloured jersey to identify the leader many newer races have chosen the same colour for example the Tour of Germany Other tours and races use other colours sometimes because of the sponsor

The Giro dItalia Tour of Italy have a pink jersey The races original sponsor was the sports newspaper which printed on pink paper like many European sports newspapers

The leader in the Vuelta a Espaa wears a golden jersey

Sometimes a rider will get three yellow jerseys 

In road bicycle racing and especially the three Grand Tour stage races Tour de France Italy and Spain the Green jersey is the name given to a cycling jersey worn by the leader in a subsidiary competition

For example while the overall race leader in the Tour de France will wear the yellow jersey or maillot jaune the green jersey will be worn by the leader in the points competition for sprinters

In the Giro dItalia and Vuelta a Espana the green jersey is worn by the King of the Mountains the leader in the competition for the best climber

The following events use the green jersey to signify the current leader andor final winner of the overall classification by time

The following events use the green jersey to signify the current leader andor final winner of the overall classification by points

The following events use the green jersey to signify the current leader andor final winner of the overall classification of the best climber 

The Rainbow jersey is a special jersey worn by world champion cyclists during races 

It is mainly white with five horizontal bands in the UCI colours around the chest From the bottom up the colours are green yellow black red and blue the same colours that appear in the rings on the olympic flag There are different jerseys for each discipline

A cyclist must wear the jersey when competing in the same discipline category and speciality that he is world champion for For example the world road race champion would wear the jersey while competing in stage races and one day races but would not during time trials Similarly on the track the world individual pursuit champion would only wear the jersey when competing in other individual pursuit events

A champion who does not wear the rainbow jersey can be fined 2500 to 5000 Swiss francs

The teams sponsor pays a lot of money to have their name on each riders jersey They can still put their names on the world champions jersey but probably smaller because there is less space Sponsors do not mind because the world champion gets a lot more publicity than ordinary riders

A world champion who is leading a stage race wears the race leaders jersey not the world champions but only while he is the leader

An escopetarra is a guitar made from a rifle it is used as a symbol of peace The name is a combination of the Spanish words escopeta and guitarra 

Escopetarras were invented in 2003 by a Colombian peace activist named Csar Lpez At a gathering after the El Nogal Club bombing in Bogot he noticed a soldier holding a gun like a guitar and got the idea for it The first escopetarra in 2003 was made from a Winchester rifle and a Stratocaster electric guitar

Lpez made five escopetarras four of which were given to Colombian musician Juanes Argentine musician Fito Pez the United Nations Development Program and the city government of Bogot while one was kept for himself Juanes later sold his escopetarra for US17000 at a Beverly Hills fundraiser held to help victims of anti personnel mines while the escopetarra given to the UN was exhibited at the June 2006 of the UN Conference on Disarmament 

In 2006 Lpez got 12 more decommissioned AK 47 machine guns from Colombias peace commissioners office After they are turned into guitars he plans to give them to popular musicians such as Shakira Carlos Santana and Paul McCartney as well as political figures such as the Dalai Lama However a member of the Dalai Lamas staff rejected Lpez offer saying it is not appropriate to give a weapon as a gift Lpez has said he will try to explain his purpose more clearly

He is buried in the Cimetire Est in the neighbouring suburb of Sallaumines

Insects have small holes in their bodies that allow them to breathe These holes are called spiracles Air comes in the spiracles and goes to trachea or tubes These tubes take the oxygen to other parts of the insect body Because insects have no lungs air comes in and goes out of the spiracles passively Some insects can open and close the spiracles to keep water out

Some spiders also have spiracles

Sharks and rays have a spiracle behind each eye When the shark is not moving the spiracle helps the shark to breathe

Henri Cornet was a French cyclist who won the second Tour de France in 1904 

Born in Desvres Pas de Calais France he was only 18 years old when he raced in the Tour de France The race was spoiled by a many of problems including irate spectators throwing nails on the road in the final stage that forced Henri Cornet to ride the last 40 kilometres with two flat tyres There were a lot of complaints about cheating the top four finishers were disqualified by a special committee of the French cycling union Although his overall time was three hours behind the first place rider race officials declared Henri Cornet the winner in November 1903 when he was 19 years and 3 months old He is the youngest ever winner

Such was the commotion over the 1904 race that Tour founder Henri Desgrange said it was probably the last time the race would ever be run  The race winner Maurice Garin was suspended from competition for two years and the second place finisher was banned for life In all nine cyclists were excluded because of illegal use of cars or trains and all of the stage winners were disqualified because of illegal agreements about allowing people to win

After 1904 Cornet never again had any great success in any race He abandoned the 1905 Tour de France in the 4th stage He did win the 1906 Paris Roubaix race but could not start the 1906 Tour de France and had to abandon it again in 1907 but did manage 8th place finish in 1908 Extremely fast in what today are called time trials he won the final leg of the 1908 race A special timed lap run at a velodrome racetrack in Paris the event was not counted as an official stage or towards the overall classification Cornet competed in his last Tour de France in 1912 finishing 28th 

He died in 1941 at the age of 56 in Prunay le Gillon Eure et Loir 

Paris Roubaix is a famous single day professional bicycle road race held in northern France starting in Compigne and finishing in Roubaix near the Belgian frontier It was one of the ten UCI Road World Cup races and became part of the UCI ProTour It is one of the Classic cycle races has the nickname The Hell of the North 

Paris Roubaix is one of the oldest professional bicycle races Tho Vienne and Maurice Perez got the idea to run the race and in 1896 the sports newspaper Le Vlo worked out original route between Paris and Roubaix The race has been contested every year since 1896 stopped only by the two World wars 

The first edition of the race was held at Easter April 19 1896 so it got the nickname of La Pascale 

188 competitors left the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris and raced almost 300 kilometres to Roubaix Josef Fischer the winner of this first edition received 1000 francs

The race is now organised by the media group Amaury Sport Organisation who also run the Tour de France

Riders are often covered from head to toe in mud and grit and race over the cobblestoned roads and hard rutted tracks of northern France However the race got the nickname lenfer du Nord or the Hell of the North from journalists who watched the race after world war I and saw it pass through many of the ruins craters and destruction along the way

Originally the race was from Paris to Roubaix but in 1966 the starting location was moved to Chantilly 50 kilometres to the north of Paris to be moved in 1977 to Compigne approximately 80 kilometres to the north of Paris Famous for rough terrain the route of Paris Roubaix is adjusted slightly from year to year as the older roads are resurfaced and the race organisers seek to replace them with other challenging cobbles to maintain the character of the race  in 2005 for example the race included 547 kilometres of cobbled sections The race finishes with 750 meters on the smooth concrete expanses of the large outdoor velodrome in Roubaix

Due to its challenging course and poor weather conditions Paris Roubaix presents a challenge to riders team support personnel and equipment alike Special frames and wheels are often used specifically for Paris Roubaix in various configurations depending on the weather conditions

The Deutschland Tour is the most important stage race in Germany Initially the race was held in MayJune Since 2005 it has been part of the UCI ProTour and has been moved to August

Already in 1911 a national cycling race of over 1500 km was held in the German Empire Until 1931 several Tours were held organised by different groups In 1931 the first Deutschlandtour was held The race was well organised and exciting between 1937 and 1939 but stopped again at the start of World War II

There was not a lot of road cycling in Germany and the tours popularity depended on German riders doing well in other races  This resulted in several parallel tours of West Germany

But after Jan Ullrichs 1997 Tour de France victory cycling became more popular Partly as because of Germanys new found cycling enthusiasm the Bund Deutscher Radfahrer eV and the company Upsolut founded the Deutschland Tour gmbh 1999 the Deutschlandtour restarted but has not been run since 2008 because of a lack of interest from TV sponsors

The Tour of the Netherlands began on 6 May 1948 but only became an annual event in 1975 From about 2000 it was known as the Eneco tour The start of the UCIs ProTour in 2005 saw the tour reorganised

The then UCI president Hein Verbruggen wanted to keep the Tour of the Netherlands for marketing reasonsrefGraat2005  The Dutch Tour organisation got a better sponsor But because the race was not difficult enough for the new ProTourthe race organisers asked the organisers of the Tour of Belgium and the Tour de Luxembourg The idea was a Tour of the Benelux that would replace the three The Tours of Belgium and Luxembourg will carry on The organisers of the Tour of Luxembourg did not want to join the new big race so the Eneco tour only covers Belgium and the Netherlands

The overall winner of the race by time wears a red jersey

In 2005 the overall winner of the race by points wears a blue jersey This was changed to a white jersey however in 2006

Lucas Cranach the Elder was a German painter and printmaker in woodcut and engraving He was born Lucas Sunder at Kronach in upper Franconia

Early on Lucas Cranach tried jobs that had something to do with painting He decorated houses but mostly made portraits and altar pieces He also helped design coins and other things

His first paintings were still lifes and animals on the walls of the palaces at Coburg and Locha They were so good that the duke asked Lucas Cranach to make a painting of him Lucas Cranach painted the duke killing a boar

Before 1508 he had painted a few altar pieces for the Castle Church at Wittenberg Albrecht Drer Hans Burgkmair and others also worked there He made many portraits of the duke and his brother John The best woodcuts and copper plates were published

More honour was given to Cranach when he went to the Netherlands in 1509 and painted the Emperor Maximilian I and the boy who became Charles V later in his life Until 1508 Cranach signed his works with the initials of his name In that year the person in charge gave him the snake with wings as a symbol This symbol was marked on all his pictures after that date 

Lucas Cranach the Elder died on 16 October 1553 at Weimar in Germany The house in which he lived still stands in the marketplace He is commemorated as an artist by the Lutheran Church on 6 April

Cranachs art in its prime was slightly affected by the art of the Italians but was also similar to that of the Netherlands and Germans

As a composer Cranach was not greatly gifted His concept of the human shape was low but he showed some freshness in the contour of incident though he not unfrequently bordered on coarseness His copper plates and woodcuts are the best pieces of his art and the earlier they are in date the more apparent is their power Striking evidence of this is the St Christopher of 1506 or the plate of Elector Frederick praying before the Madonna 

His first woodcut represents the Virgin and three saints in prayer before a crucifix Later on he composes the marriage of St Catherine a series of martyrdoms and scenes from the Passion 

After 1517 he occasionally draws the old gospel themes but he also gives style to some of the thoughts of the Reformers In a picture of 1518 at Leipzig where a dying man offers his soul to God his body to earth and his worldly goods to his relations the soul rises to meet the Trinity in heaven and being saved is clearly shown to depend on faith and not on good works Again sin and grace become a familiar subject of description in pictures Adam is observed sitting between John the Baptist and a prophet at the foot of a tree To the left God brings out the tables of the law Adam and Eve partake of the forbidden fruit the serpent is holding his head up high and punishment takes place in the shape of death and the realm of Satan To the right the birth Crucifixion and Resurrection symbolize achievement and this is duly impressed on Adam by John the Baptist who points to the sacrifice of the crucified Saviour There are two examples of this work in the galleries of Gotha and Prague both of them dated 1529

Cranach had three sons all artists John Lucas Cranach who died at Bologna in 1536 Hans Cranach whose life is obscure and Lucas Cranach the younger who took over his fathers workshop after his death He also had a daughter Barbara Cranach married to Christian Brck ancestors of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

Edwards v Aguillard was a 1987 United States Supreme Court case that said that creationism was not science The Supreme Court said that it was religion and could not be taught in American schools because the United States Constitution does not allow the government to support one religion more than other religions and so schools run by the government cannot teach religion as being true This rule is known as the Establishment Clause

The Establishment Clause is part of the United States Constitution that does not allow the government to support one religion more than any other religions The government also can not say a religion or a god is true The govern It is often described as separation of church and state where state means the government

Kitzmiller et al v Dover Area School District et al is the full name of an American trial from 2005 It is also called the Dover trial because it happened in Dover Pennsylvania It said that intelligent design was not science and could not be taught as science in schools

Intelligent design is the idea that the universe is not simple enough to be made by nature Instead people who believe in intelligent design think that a smarter force must have made everything or at least important parts of it

Evolution is sciences explanation of how all of the different kinds of life developed from a simple beginning Intelligent design is another explanation that life was developed by a smart being A school district in Dover Pennsylvania wanted to tell the students about intelligent design They wanted teachers to tell their students about intelligent design at the same time they taught evolution They were using a text book from the Foundation for Thought and Ethics called Of Pandas and People written by Percival Davis and Dean Kenyon This book says it presents the scientific evidence for intelligent design and why it makes more sense than evolution Tammy Kitzmiller and ten other parents did not want their children being taught intelligent design They complained to the government and a trial was held

There was an earlier trial called Edwards v Aguillard It was about teaching creationism in schools Creationism is the belief that God created the universe like it says in the Bible or other religious books

The United States Constitution is the set of rules that all of the government in the United States must follow It does not allow the government to support one religion more than any other religion Schools run by the government cannot teach one type of religion as being true In Edwards v Aguillard the United States Supreme Court said that creationism was not science It said it was religious because it tried to explain things using stories from the Bible The Supreme Court said that creationism could not be taught in public schools But people said intelligent design was not creationism

During the trial experts showed that intelligent design was an old argument for religion and not science They looked at the authors notes for the book Of Pandas and People that the school was using These notes included things that had been changed when the book was being prepared for printing It had been changed from being about creationism to being about intelligent design The authors did this by changing the words created to designed and creationists to intelligent design proponents The judge found this interesting These changes were made just after Edwards v Aguillard said you could not teach creationism in schools The judge said this showed that intelligent design was creationism

In one part of the trial they spoke to Michael Behe Behe was one of the people that helped create intelligent design He said nobody could say how evolution made the immune system the thing in your body that protects you from diseases He said that some smarter force had to have made it Behe was shown 58 articles nine books and lots of other things scientists wrote to show how the immune system could have been made by evolution He said none of them was good enough The judge did not think this was true

After the trial the judge said that intelligent design was creationism not science The government is not allowed to support one religion more than any other religion Creationism had already been shown to be religious Therefore schools can not teach intelligent design as that would be saying one type of religion was true

Psychometrics is a science that tries to measure educational and psychological levels of people and groups of people Areas of people which are studied include intelligence skills and personality traits The science is mainly a part of the science of psychology

In physics drag is a force which tends to slow down the movement of an object through a liquid or gas As a moving object pushes the liquid or gas out of its way the liquid or gas pushes back on the object This drag force is always opposite to the objects motion and unlike friction between solid surfaces the drag force increases as the object moves faster 

Air resistance is a force that is caused by air the force acts in the opposite direction to an object moving through the air It is where air particles hit the front of the object slowing it down The more surface area the more air particles hit it For example a truck with a flat front will experience high air resistance while a sports car with a streamlined shape will experience lower air resistance allowing the car to go faster

Manatees are large fully aquatic marine mammals of the order Sirenia They are sometimes known as sea cows The manatees form the genus Trichechus and the family Trichechidae There are three manatee species

The name comes from the Spanish manat which itself comes from a Carib word meaning breast

Christopher Columbus who thought mermaids were real went to the waters around Haiti and wrote in his broken wikt linklogbooklogbook that he had seen three mermaids He said that they were not as beautiful as everybody said they were Nowadays people believe Christopher Columbus had actually seen three manatees It is possible he saw them kissing one another which is something they do when the meet each other in the water

Manatees have thick pads around their lips stiff broken wikt linkbristlebristles that help them grab food and move it towards the mouth A manatee eats sea grass and all kinds of sea vegetation All its teeth are shaped like a humans molars The eight hours of chewing each day wears down on their teeth In fact its first two pairs of teeth get so worn out that they simply fall out sometimes However manatees can grow new teeth  just like sharks New teeth are always growing in the back When front teeth fall out the back teeth move forward to take their place

Manatees live on the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean and the rivers The West African Manatee lives on the western side of Africa on the shores from Senegal to Angola They also live in some rivers like the Niger River and around Lake Chad The West Indian Manatee lives in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean and also on the shores of Brazil and Venezuela The Amazonian Manatee lives in parts of the Amazon Basin in South America

Manatees live in salt water and in fresh water On the sea shores they mostly live in shallow water like lagoons and mangroves They also live in brackish water and rivers Manatees like bodies of water with a temperature of over 20 C

They are mainly herbivores spending most of their time grazing in shallow waters at depths of 1 2 metres

Natural history is the study of plants and animals in the wild and the environments they live in Also included are those aspects of geology which can be done in the field 

The work of naturalists is observation interpretation collecting and classification rather than experiments People who study natural history are called naturalists Charles Darwin was a naturalist They were among the first to explore the world They were the first to study the Amazon and other tropical places Naturalists find new species and classify plants and animals They study ecology

Naturalists developed some theoretical ideas which were valuable They noticed that living things more or less fitted the lives they led This was adaptation They noticed a struggle for existence between animals They thought they could see a chain of being from lower animals to higher which they thought was the work of God The idea that such things might happen by natural means began to surface in the 18th century but did not become the majority view until the time of Charles Darwin

Before Darwin most naturalists did not think of themselves as scientists When they looked at nature perhaps as explorers they looked at everything They looked at the land the people the plants and animals After Darwin they did see themselves as scientists Early on Darwin called himself a geologist Huxley was an anatomist Hooker was a botanist Lyell was a geologist Their education changed too They often took degrees in science That sort of education was rare before Darwin

Naturalists were educated amateurs scientists are trained professionals The change happened slowly during the 19th century The very word scientist was invented in 1937 by William Whewell Before then the term was natural philosopher or natural historian Naturalist is short for natural historian

These men are important They are just some well known names amongst the many who investigated nature before science existed in its modern form

Theistic evolution is the belief that God or another higher power used evolution as a tool to create the different species of living creatures on earth

During the war years a scheme was set up for the farmers to study abroad He as a result went to England for studies In 1951 he returned to Pakistan but he found that he was cut off from the rest of the scientific world there He again went to England where he started having interest in the Grand Unified Theory

He believed that if the Creator of the universe was one then the origin of all the forces had to be single also He then set off to unify the Electromagnetic and the Weak Nuclear Force According to another scientist Peter Higgs a field existed ie the Higgs field it had many corrugurations Abdus Salam concluded that the Z and W particles the weak force carriers travelled on these rough features therefore they gained mass while the photons travelled along these uneven features and therefore were massless

The Pleistocene was one long ice age cold glacial periods with shorter warmer interglacials Ice ages are when the world becomes much colder for a long time Much of the world we know was covered by ice North America down to and past the Great Lakes all of northern Russia and Europe England down to the Thames

Many animals that lived then have become extinct Climate change and hunting by humans were responsible Many of the mammals were larger and hairier versions of animals that live now Glyptodon was something like a giant armadillo and mammoths were hairy elephants

Louis XV was a French king who ruled from 1715 until his death in 1774 He is the great grandson of Louis XIV whom he succeeded at age of five He was called The Beloved His failure to provide strong leadership and badly needed reforms contributed to the crisis that brought on the French Revolution

Louis was born at Versailles on February 15 1710 the son of Louis Dauphin of France and his mother Marie Adlade of Savoy Philippe Duke of Orlans Regent of France governed as regent until Louis reached his legal majority in 1723 In 1725 the king married Maria Leszczyska daughter of Stanisaw I of Poland The following year his former tutor Andr Hercule de Fleury became the chief minister Fleury gave France a stable administration until his death 17 years later Thereafter Louis himself was in nominal control but he took only a sporadic interest in government and never followed any consistent policy at home or abroad He was frequently influenced by his mistresses the most powerful of whom was the marquise de Pompadour

France was involved in three wars during Louiss reign As a result of the first the War of the Polish Succession France gained the province of Lorraine The second the War of the Austrian Succession which marked the beginning of a colonial struggle with Britain was indecisive In the last the Seven Years War France crippled by corruption and mismanagement lost most of its overseas possessions to the British French foreign policy in this period was made chaotic by Louiss secret diplomacy as his agents in other countries sometimes pursued aims that were in conflict with those of his own ministers The situation improved somewhat in the 1760s when a new minister the duc de Choiseul restored some order to the government and tried to repair the damage done by the Seven Years War In the last years of his reign Louis cooperated with his chancellor Ren de Maupeou in an effort to reform the countrys inequitable and inefficient system of taxation In 1771 the parlements or sovereign courts which had opposed reform were reorganized and stripped of their power to obstruct royal decrees Measures were then implemented to tax the previously exempt nobility and clergy but these were reversed after the kings death at Versailles on May 10 1774 Louis XV died of smallpox as a defeated and unpopular king He was succeeded by his grandson Louis XVI who was later guilotined during the French Revolution

Whitbourne is a town on the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland and Labrador Canada

Whitbourne Newfoundlands first inland town is named after Sir Richard Whitbourne one of the most colorful early settlers of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador who wrote a book about Newfoundland that was published in 1620 Sir Richard was selected by the High Court of the Admiralty to set up the first English law court in the New World in 1615 in Trinity He was kidnapped and held by the infamous Pirate Peter Easton in Harbour Grace He also described a mermaid that he saw in St Johns harbour Later he became governor of Renews on the Southern Shore

Whitbourne unlike most communities on the Island of Newfoundland is inland It was founded in about 1880 during the construction of the Newfoundland Railway The railway continued to be an important employer in the Town until its abandonment in 1988 although its economic importance weakened slowly throughout the twentieth century

Sir Robert Bond the Prime Minister from 1900 to 1909 played a role in the expansion and planning of the Town and developed a complex country home the Grange there

The town of Whitbourne is located just off the Trans Canada Highway on Route 81 It is located at the center of three possible routes to visit the Avalon Peninsula Route 80 is one of the two entrances to the Baccalieu Trail Route 100 and Route 81 lead to the Marine Atlantic Ferry Service in Argentia and other parts of Placentia and St Marys Bays and Route 1 the Trans Canada leads towards the second entrance to the Baccalieu Trail and the capital city of St Johns As a result there is a Provincial Visitor Information Center on the Trans Canada near the town

Wind power in South Australia is a big energy source for the state and South Australia is well suited to wind farms as it is close to the Roaring forties winds

As of December 2010 South Australia has thirteen wind farms with an installed capacity of 1018 megawatts A further 184 MW of projects are under construction

Wind farms do not emit greenhouse gases in the generation of electricity and so wind power is considered a highly desirable form of renewable energy which assists in the reduction of the States reliance on coal and gas fired electricity generation

There are several Solar power plants in the Mojave Desert which supply power to the electricity grid  Solar Energy Generating Systems is the name given to nine solar power plants in the Mojave Desert which were built in the 1980s These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts making them the largest solar power installation in the world Nevada Solar One is a new solar thermal plant with a 64 MW generating capacity located near Boulder City Nevada There are also plans to build other large solar plants in the Mojave Desert The Mojave Solar Park will deliver 553 MW of solar thermal power when fully operational in 2011

Insolation in the Mojave Desert is among the best available in the United States and some significant population centers are located in the area This makes the Mojave Desert particularly suitable for solar power plants These plants can generally be built in a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular readily available materials

Charles Franois Gounod was a French composer Gounod wrote many different kinds of pieces but he is best known today for his operas Faust and Romeo and Juliet and especially for the very popular Ave Maria which is a melody that goes with a prelude by Johann Sebastian Bach

Gounod was born in Paris His father was a painter and engraver His mother was his first piano teacher When his father died in 1823 his mother started a school to teach the piano Gounod soon showed musical talent and went to study at the Paris Conservatoire He studied with three teachers all of whom died soon after Gounod became their pupil The first time he competed for the Prix de Rome he did not get it but the third time in 1839 he was successful This meant that he could go to Rome to learn more about music

In Rome he liked the religious music of the 16th century by composers such as Palestrina He did not much like the modern opera composers such as Donizetti and Bellini Gounod also spent some of the year in Austria and Germany He passed through Leipzig where he met Mendelssohn whose music made a big impression on him

Gounod returned to Paris where he got a job as director of music at a church He thought of becoming a priest but then he changed his mind He left his job in the church Some time later he became friends with the singer Pauline Viardot and her husband Louis He spent some time at their house composing the opera Sapho

He composed the Messe Sollennelle also known as the Saint Cecilia Mass Two fragments of this work were first performed in London during 1851 and it helped him to become famous By this time he was married He had a job in charge of several choirs He started to write a lot of choral music

He wrote two symphonies in 1855 the 1st Symphony in D major and the 2nd Symphony in E flat although they are not often played today

In 1856 he started to write the opera by which he is now best remembered Faust based on the first part of the play Faust by Goethe The opera was produced in 1859 and soon was performed in many countries especially in Germany The composer Richard Wagner was the most important opera composer in Germany and his operas were quite different so he said that Gounods operas were silly

When the Franco Prussian war broke out in 1870 Gounod went to live in England He stayed there for five years becoming the first conductor of what is now the Royal Choral Society Gounod wrote a lot of music for choirs at this time including a motet composed especially for the grand opening of the Royal Albert Hall in 1871 He worked very hard although he was often depressed about the war situation in France His house in Saint Cloud had been destroyed He returned to France in 1874 and was glad to be back with his family

He wrote much chamber music including five string quartets but these are hardly ever played today

Later in his life Gounod became very interested in religion again He wrote a lot of religious music including his famous musical setting of Ave Maria based on the first prelude from Book I of the Well Tempered Clavier by JS Bach and Hymnus Pontificius the anthem of Vatican He also wrote two oratorios including Mors et vita which Queen Victoria liked so much that she asked for it to be played in the Royal Albert Hall in 1886

He was just finishing a requiem called Le Grand Requiem when he died He was given a state funeral on October 27 1893 He asked for all the music at his funeral to be chant only

Rugby sevens is the shortened version of rugby union in which only seven players per side feature instead of the full fifteen The version of rugby union is very popular with notable competitions including the IRB Sevens World Series and the Rugby World Cup Sevens It is also played at events such as the Commonwealth Games and rugby league has also adopted the sevens format

Rugby sevens was invented in Melrose a small town in Scotland

It is played under the same rules and on a field of the same dimensions as the 15 player game but a rugby sevens match lasts approximately 15 minutes but the finals last somewhat more than 20 minutes each half in a final is ten minutes instead of the normal seven minutes and the point system is similar to rugby union where a Try gets a team 5 points and conversion 2 points with 3 points for penalties and Drop goals Points scoring occurs with much greater regularity in sevens compared to fifteens since there are more spaces for players to run Scrums still exist within sevens composed of just three players from each team Given the speedy nature of the game players are usually either from the backline or the trio of loose forwards in fifteens rugby

The Rugby World Cup Sevens is the worlds premier international contest in the Sevens version of rugby union first held in Scotland in 1993 and held every four years The winning trophy is the Melrose Cup named after the Scottish town of Melrose where the first sevens game was played The current holders are Fiji who have won the Cup twice since it was first played in 1993

Michel de Nostredame also known as Nostradamus was a French apothecary and allegedly a doctor He is famous as a seer who wrote collections of prophecies that have since become famous around the world His best known book was called Les Propheties and first appeared in 1555 Since its first publication the book has rarely been out of print Over the years many people have come to believe that Nostradamus predicted a range of events in history People often reached this conclusion by applying methods similar to the Bible code  ie by twisting the texts in such a way as to suggest that they predicted the future

Most academics say that these associations between Nostradamus quatrains and world events are the result of misinterpretations or bad translations that are so far fetched that they are useless as a source of genuine prediction What is more no interpretation has yet managed to predict any event before it happened

Some people have written prophecies that were wrongly assumed to be by Nostradamus For example in 1997 a college student in Canada wrote an essay that included a fake English quatrain written in the same style that Nostradamus used in French The quatrain ended up on the Internet where it was soon assumed that it was a verse by Nostradamus himself predicting the events of 911 So many people e mailed it to their friends thinking that it was by Nostradamus that the associated websites and discussion forums were soon overwhelmed

A trough is an elongated area of comparatively low atmospheric pressure usually in association with weather fronts

Convective cells may form in the surrounding area of troughs and give birth to a tropical cyclone Some tropical or subtropical areas such as the Philippines or south China are greatly affected by convection cells along a trough In the mid latitude westerlies troughs and ridges often exchange with each other especially when upper level winds are in a high amplitude pattern For a trough in the westerlies the region just west of the trough axis is typically an area of convergent winds and descending air  and hence high pressure  while the region just east of the trough axis is an area of fast divergent winds and low pressure Tropical waves are a type of trough in easterly currents a cyclonic northward deflection of the trade winds

The QuikSCAT is an earth observing satellite that provides wind speed and direction information over oceans to NOAA It is a quick recovery mission to fill the gap created by the loss of data from the NASA Scatterometer that was lost in June 1997 It is in a sun synchronous low earth orbit

Because of the 2003 failure of the ADEOS II satellite that was meant to succeed the NSCAT QuickSCAT is currently the only US owned instrument in orbit that measures surface winds over the oceans The European Space Agency has its own scatterometers in orbit such as Envisat

However because it is now running on a backup transmitter and having other problems this satellite could fail at any moment putting risk at weather forecasts for possibly dangerous tropical cyclones

In early June 2007 Bill Proenza Director of the National Hurricane Center in Florida came under fire for criticizing his NOAA superiors for not creating a back up plan for replacing the capabilities provided by this satellite

A shepherd is someone who looks after sheep Shepherds usually take the sheep out into fields so that they can graze In the same way someone who looks after cows is called a cowherd A swineherd looks after pigs and a goatherd looks after goats A herd is a group of animals To herd can also mean to get a herd of animals to move along A female shepherd is called a shepherdess

Many years ago when most people lived in the country shepherding was very common Sheep were kept for their milk meat and especially their wool We know that there were shepherds in some parts of the world thousands of years ago

The shepherds job was to make sure the sheep were safe and they were not eaten by wolves or other wild animals

In many societies shepherds were an important part of the economy Unlike farmers shepherds were often wage earners They were paid to watch other peoples sheep Shepherds often lived all on their own Some were nomadic  Shepherds were most often the younger sons of simple farmers who did not inherit any land Still in other societies each family would have a family member to shepherd its flock often a child or young person or an old person who was not able to help much with the harder work 

Shepherds often worked with dogs The dogs were trained to herd the sheep Sheepdog trials are still popular today The shepherd has to give signs to the dog to tell it exactly where he wants the sheep to go 

A shepherd had a lot of time to sit and think or amuse himself He often made simple instruments out of reeds that grew where he sat These instruments were often simple panpipes or just pipes which were similar to bamboo pipes or a modern recorder Some shepherds learned to carve instruments out of wood An example is the fujara from Slovakia and southern Poland

Shepherds often made up music This is why composers of classical music very often wrote music which imitated the sound of the shepherds pipe For example in Mozarts opera The Magic Flute the character Papageno a birdcatcher plays on his pipes In the Symphonie Fantastique Berlioz wrote music which describes a shepherd playing his pipes and a shepherdess far away the other side of the hill answering his call Berlioz used an oboe and a cor anglais for this

Musicians were not the only people who liked the idea of the life of a shepherd Many painters painted scenes in the country with sheep being looked after by a shepherd Poets wrote about shepherds The shepherds way of life was thought to be the ideal way to live It was called Arcadian Poems like these are called pastoral after the term for herding Some early examples are the Idylls of Theocritus and the Eclogues of Virgil 

In the Christian religion Jesus is often called the good shepherd because he looks after his people in the same way that a shepherd looks after his sheep

Muhammad the Prophet of Islam was proud of being part of a rich tradition of prophets who made their living as shepherds 

The Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia was a Marxist Leninist guerilla organization that operated from 1975 to 1986 The stated intention of ASALA was to compel the Turkish Government to acknowledge publicly its alleged responsibility for the deaths of 15 million Armenians in 1915 pay reparations and cede territory for an Armenian homeland 

ASALA was founded in 1975 in Beirut Lebanon by Hagop Hagopian and Kevork Ajemian a prominent contemporary writer

The groups activities were primarily assassinations of Turkish diplomats and politicians in Western Europe in the United States and the Middle East A failed attack in Geneva on October 3 1980 in which two Armenian militants were injured resulted in a new nickname for the group the 3 October Organization The ASALAs eight point manifesto was published in 1981

Continuous attacks prompted Turkey to accuse Cyprus Greece Syria Lebanon and the Soviet Union of provoking or possibly funding the ASALA though nothing of this sort was ever found to be true

According to Dr Tessa Hofmann Turkish officials frequently used the accusation of collaboration with the ASALA and foreign Armenian circles to incriminate extreme left wing Turkish opposition groups

Kevork Ajemian was an Armenian writer journalist and public activist one of the founders of ASALA military organization 

Kevork Ajemian was born in Syria in the family of Armenian refugees In early age he moved to Lebanon where he studied at the American University of Beirut 

A prominent representative of the new generation of Armenian Diaspora writers of 1960s he wrote both in Armenian and in English his books were published in Lebanon USA and USA 

In 1978 1989 Ajemian edited the Spurk journal in 1979 he took part of the First Armenian Congress Organizing Committee He died in Paris France 

In 1999 a collection of the best journalistic works of Ajemian was published

The cor anglais or English horn is a double reed instrument in the woodwind family It is very similar to an oboe but as it is longer than an oboe it plays lower notes

The lowest note of an oboe is B flat The lowest note of a cor anglais is an E natural a diminshed fifth lower than the oboes lowest note

The cor anglais is a transposing instrument pitched in F This means that the music sounds a fifth lower than written This has the advantage that the cor anglais player uses fingering as if he were playing an oboe but it will sound a fifth lower 

The bell is shaped like a pear This gives it a less nasal sound The reed is not fixed to a piece of cork like the oboe reed but it is put straight onto the short piece of metal at the top of the instrument 

The word cor anglais is a French word which literally means English horn but the cor anglais is neither English nor a horn No one is sure how it got its name but many people think it is because the bocal at the top is curved

Many oboists can play the cor anglais as well just as flautists can play the piccolo

There are few solo pieces for the instrument but mostly it is used for solo melodies in slow pieces for orchestra because it can sound very expressive

Some famous examples of cor anglais solos can be found in

An Artificial sweetener or Sugar substitute is a chemical It is added to some foods to make them taste sweet It is made to taste like sugar or corn syrup Usually it has a much lower energy value than sugar It can be found in many products which say Light or Diet in their name 

Consumers use artificial sweeteners for one of the following reasons

Studies done with animals have shown that artificial sweeteners cause weight gain A sweet taste causes insulin to be produced This will store some of the sugar in the blood in tissues including fat With artificial sweeteners the amount of sugar in the blood does not increase This means that there will be too little sugar in the blood This is known as hypoglycemia On the next meal more food will be eaten to get the blood sugar level back to normal values After a while rats given sweeteners have steadily increased the amount of calories This increased body weight and adiposity The natural response to eating sugary foods is to eat less at the next meal and to use some of the extra energy to warm the body after the meal When using artificial sweeteners this effect is lost gradually

Cargo cult is name given to several religions There are many cargo cults in Melanesia and New Guinea These religions are started when tribal societies come into contact with Western civilisation When the first contact happened the tribespeople saw Western manufactured goods like radios These things are called cargo The tribespeople did not know how the manufactured goods worked nor how they were made They made imitations of such goods which of course did not work 

They imitate the behaviour they saw the Westerners do in the hope that some spirits will send them more cargo In other cases such as on the island of Tanna in Vanuatu cult members worship Americans who brought the cargo

During the age of colonialism the colonial powers came in contact with many simpler societies The first cargo cults were documented in New Guinea and other countries of Micronesia Melanesia and the West Pacific Ocean 

The people who are part of the cargo cults think that the cargo was created by their deities and ancestors They think that the cargo was made for the members of the cargo cult but the foreigners have it For this reason the efforts and rituals of cargo cults are done so that the foreigners should get less of these goods and the cult members more of them

Ruhleben POW Camp was a camp near Berlin Germany where British prisoners of war were detained during World War I Ruhleben itself was then a village 10 kilometres to the west of Berlin but now it is part of the city of Berlin in a district called Ruhleben in the borough of Spandau The camp was originally a horse racecourse

The detainees came from countries that were fighting against Germany in the war Most of them were British They were in Germany when the war broke out which is why they were taken prisoner Some of them were in Germany because they lived there others were on holiday at the time Some of them were crew members of civilian ships that happened to be in German harbours at the time or who were captured at sea

There were about 5500 prisoners in the camp Most of them spent all four years of World War I there Books have been written about what it was like living in the camp These include To Ruhleben  And Back by Geoffrey Pyke who successfully escaped from the camp in 1915

The detainees were mostly treated quite well The guards had to obey the Geneva Conventions Although there were some people who found it very difficult being kept there many others found lots of things to do to keep themselves occupied Letters books sports equipment and a printing press were all allowed into the camp and the detainees organised their own police force magazine library and postal service Some of the detainees were young people who later became famous They included the Canadian musician Ernest MacMillan who later became the conductor of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra MacMillan had been on holiday in Germany to visit the Bayreuth Festival when war broke out Charles Ellis and James Chadwick later became famous scientists They used their time in Ruhleben to study They were able to build a laboratory and do some experiments There were famous footballers and athletes as well

A lot of musical activities were organized in the camp There was a Ruhleben Musical Society Ernest MacMillan was a member and he gave concerts and lectures Together with the composer and pianist Benjamin Dale he played piano duet versions of all Beethovens symphonies The society put on a performance of the Gilbert and Sullivan opera Mikado and a pantomime version of Cinderella They did not have the music for the Mikado but someone had the libretto and four of the musicians wrote the music from what they could remember They wrote it out for whatever instruments they had in the camp There was also a Ruhleben Drama Society which put on productions of Shakespeares Othello and Twelfth Night and Oscar Wildes The Importance of Being Earnest

As well as music and drama sports also played a big part in the life of the camp detainees Among the detainees were four people who had been England internationals Fred Spiksley Fred Pentland Samuel Wolstenholme and Steve Bloomer a Scotland international John Cameron a German international Edwin Dutton and John Brearley once of Everton and Tottenham Hotspur There was a Ruhleben Football Association Sometimes 1000 detainees watched a game Cricket rugby tennis golf and boxing were also popular

Pierre Curie was a French physicist He shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with his wife Marie Curie and Henri Becquerel for the work on spontaneous radioactivity which Becquerel discovered

Pierre Curie is not as well known as Marie Curie although Pierre and his brother had done a lot of work before Pierres marriage and work with Marie They were the first to use the term radioactivity and were pioneers in its study Pierre and his brother Jacques Curie built a special meter for measuring small amounts of electricity which Pierre and Marie used in their other discoveries

Pierre died after a carriage accident in Paris on 19 April 1906 His head was crushed under the wheels If he had lived he would probably have died by radiation poisoning as Marie did As they were the first to study radioactivity they did not know how dangerous it was

After Pierres death a group of scientists at the Radiology Congress decided to honour him by naming the unit of radioactivity a curie

Pierre and Marie Curies daughter Irne Joliot Curie and their son in law Frdric Joliot Curie were also physicists involved in the study of radioactivity and were also awarded the Nobel prize for their work Their other daughter Eve wrote her mothers biography His granddaughter Hlne Langevin Joliot is a professor of nuclear physics at the University of Paris and his grandson Pierre Joliot who was named after him is a noted biochemist

The Maya languages is a group of languages spoken in Central America

Mayan languages are spoken by at least 6 million native Maya Most of them are in Guatemala Mexico or Belize In 1996 Guatemala formally recognized 21 Mayan languages by name and Mexico recognises eight more

Soconusco is a region of the Mexican state of Chiapas It is in the most southern part of the state It borders the Republic of Guatemala on the southeast the regions Costa Sierra and Fraylesca of Chiapas on the east and north and the shore of the Pacific Ocean on the southwest It is a region of rich lowlands and foothills The economic center of Soconusco is Tapachula

The name comes from the Nahuatl word xoconostle meaning the fruit of the prickly pear cactus It was under the Mexican culture the farthest region of trade The area provided jaguar pelts cacao and quetzal feathers for the ruling classes in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan   

The Soconusco region is the main coffee producing region in Chiapas It has many plantations farther inland in the foothills of the Sierra Madre del Sur

Chiapas is the southernmost state of Mexico It is towards the southeast of the country Chiapas is bordered by the states of Tabasco to the north Veracruz to the northwest and Oaxaca to the west To the east Chiapas borders Guatemala and to the south the Pacific Ocean 

Chiapas has an area of sq mi to km228528 The 2005 census population was 4293459 people

In general Chiapas has a humid tropical weather In the north in the area bordering Tabasco near Teapa rainfall can be more than 3000 mm per year In the past natural vegetation at this region was lowland tall perennial rainforest but this vegetation has been destroyed almost completely to give way to agriculture and ranching Rainfall decreases moving towards the Pacific Ocean but it is still abundant enough to allow the farming of bananas and many other tropical crops near Tapachula On the several parallel sierras or mountain ranges running along the center of Chiapas climate can be quite temperate and foggy This allows the development of cloud forests like those of the Reserva de la Biosfera el Triunfo home to a handful of quetzals and horned guans

The state capital is Tuxtla Gutirrez Other cities and towns in Chiapas include San Cristbal de las Casas Comitn and Tapachula Chiapas is also home to the ancient Maya ruins of Palenque Yaxchilan Bonampak Chinkultic and Tonina

Most people in Chiapas are poor rural small farmers About one quarter of the population are of full or predominant Maya descent and in rural areas many do not speak Spanish The state suffers from the highest rate of malnutrition in Mexico This rate is estimated to affect over 40 of the population

Other social issues involve the increasing presence of the Central American gangs known as Maras and illegal immigration from Central America in general This migration is mostly directed towards the United States but it makes local poverty even worse Many times there are abuse and Human Rights violations that touch these migrants

In 1994 there was an outbreak of violence between the Mexican Government and the Zapatista Army of National Liberation Today the EZLN has rejected the use of force and seek to be recognized as a voice of the poor There are currently 32 rebel autonomous zapatista municipalities controlled by the EZLN in Chiapas examples of these communities are Ocosingo and Las Margaritas

Urbanism is the study of cities Urbanists look at the different factors present in a city A city is different from rural areas There are certain things than make people come to a city to live and work there There are also certain factors like where the city is located that have an influence on the economic social and cultural development of that city

Teotihuacn teotiwakan was a city in pre Columbian America At the time it was most populated it was the largest known city there This was from about the 1st century to about the 5th century 

The civilization and culture lived around this city is also called Teotihuacn Its important position can be seen in various sites in Veracruz and the area controlled by the Maya civilization

The city is about 40km away from Mexico City in the State of Mexico It is about 83 km in surface It was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987

The name Teotihuacn was given by the Nahuatl speaking Aztec centuries after the fall of the city Although the original name of the city is unknown it can be seen in hieroglyph inscriptions Nahuatl creation myths took place in the city The Nauhatl nameTeotihuacn therefore translates to birthplace of the gods 

The Maya seemed to have referred to it as puh as place of reeds This is similar to other Central Mexican settlements that took the name Tollan such as Tula Hidalgo and Cholula It looks like Tollan was a general term used for large settlements In the concept of urbanism of the time Tollan and other names seemed like a metaphor They linked the bundles of reeds and rushes that formed part of the environment of the Valley of Mexico and the large gathering of people in a city

The early history of Teotihuacn is still debated At first archeologists believed the city was built by the Toltec people The Toltec were an early Mexican civilization Archeologists believed this because it is what the Aztecs wrote about the city The Nahuatl word Toltec means great craftsman There are some cases where it does not refer to the Toltec civilization Teotihuacan also seems to be older than the Toltec civilization This means the Toltec have probably not founded the cityFactdateFebruary 2007

Other people believe the Totonac were the founders of Teotihuacn The debate continues to this day At least some of the people living in Teotihuacn seemed to have come from areas influenced by the Teotihuacano civilization This includes the Zapotec Mixtec and Maya peoples The culture and architecture of Teotihuacn was also influenced by the Olmec people They are considered to be the mother civilization of Mesoamerica The earliest buildings at Teotihuacn date to about 200 BCE and the largest pyramid the Pyramid of the Sun was completed by 100 CE

The city reached its zenith between 150 and 450 It was the center of a powerful culture whose influence extended through much of the Mesoamerican region At its height the city covered over 30 km It probably housed a population of over 150000 people possibly as many as 250000 Various districts in the city housed people from across the Teotihuacano region of influence that spread south as far as Guatemala There seem to be no fortifications or military structures in the city

Different researchers have discussed what the relations the city had with the other cultural centers of the region might have been like The most notable other civilzation in the region were the Mayas Researchers agree that there was a large cultural exchange between Teothihuacan and its neighbors Teotihuacan inspired ideologies and motifs persisted at Maya centres into the Late Classic long after Teotihuacan itself had declined The ideas of exchange range from a military domination of Teotihuacan over its neighbors to a policy of adopting foreign traits if they were useful 

Architectural styles from Teotihuacn can also be found in Mesoamerican sites far away Some researchers see this as evidence for Teotihuacans far reaching interactions and political or militaristic dominance A style that has been particularly associated with Teotihuacan is known as talud tablero In this style an inwards sloping external side of a structure is below a rectangular panel Variants of the generic style can be found in some Maya region sites These sites include Tikal Kaminaljuyu Copan Becan and Oxkintok They can be found particularly in the Petn Basin and the central Guatemalan highlands The Talud Tablero style is probably older than Teotihuacn It seems to have come from the Tlaxcala Puebla region originally The style seemed to have appeared at Tikal before the 5th century where Teotihuacn related motifs also appear The style seems to have spread through the region form the end of the Preclasic period unrelated to the influence of Teotihuacn It is currently unclear where the style originally came from and how it arrived in the Maya region

The city was a center of industry Many potters jewelers and craftsmen lived there Many obsidian artifacts were produced in Teotihuacn Unfortunately no ancient Teotihuacano non ideographic texts are known to exist Mentions of the city in inscriptions from Maya cities show that Teotihuacn nobility travelled to local rulers as far away as Honduras It might have conquered them Maya inscriptions mention an individual nicknamed by scholars as Spearthrower Owl He seems to have been a ruler of Teotihuacn who reigned for over 60 years He installed his relatives as rulers of Tikal and Uaxactn in Guatemala Most of what we infer about the culture at Teotihuacn comes from the murals on the site and others like the Wagner Murals found in private collections and from hieroglyphic inscriptions made by the Maya describing their encounters with Teotihuacano conquerors

At first people believed that sometime in the 7th or 8th century the city was sacked and burned by invaders The Toltecs might have invaded the city More recent research shows that the fire damage and looting seems to be limited to the structures and houses of the elite This evidence makes an uprising more likely than invasion The invasion theory is also flawed because excavation and restoration work started with the temples and palaces All these structures showed fire damage The archaeologists then concluded that probably the whole city was burned 

The destruction seems to have been focused on structures along the Avenue of the Dead Some statues seem to have been destroyed in a rather methodical way The population in the city started to decline around the 6th century This supports the hypothesis that there was unrest in the city The decline in population is generally linked to droughts These were linked to climate change occurring in 535 536 There also seem to be more skeletons of young people and more evidence of malnutrition in city in the 6th century

There is no conflict between the theories Both increased warfare and internal unrest can also be effects of a general period of drought and famine 

Other cities nearby tried to take the position of Teotihuacn These include Cholula Xochicalco and Cacaxtla They tried to fill the power vacuum left by Teotihuacns decline They may have aligned themselves against Teotihuacn to reduce its influence and power The art and architecture at these sites show an interest in emulating Teotihuacn forms There is also but also a broader mix of motifs and iconography from other parts of Mesoamerica particularly the Maya region 

Teotihuacn was a multi ethnic city with distinct Zapotec Mixtec Maya and what seem to be Nahua quarters The Totonacs have always maintained that they were the ones who built it a story that was later supported by the Aztecs

In his 2001 paper Terrence Kaufman shows linguistic evidence that suggests that an important ethnic group in Teotihuacn spoke Totonacan andor Mixe Zoquean languages He uses this to explain general influences from Totonacan and Mixe Zoquean languages in many other Mesoamerican languages Many of these languages do not have any known history of contact with either of the above mentioned groups

The religion of Teotihuacn is similar to those of other Mesoamerican cultures Many of the same gods were worshipped This includes the Feathered Serpent and The Rain god Teotihuacn was a major religious center The priests probably had a great deal of political power As with other Mesoamerican cultures Teotihuacnos practiced human sacrifice Human bodies and animal sacrifices have been found during excavations of the pyramids at Teotihuacn When the buildings were expanded sacrifices were probably made to dedicate the new building The victims could have been enemy warriors captured in battle They were then brought to the city to be ritually sacrificed so the city could prosper Some were decapitated others had their hearts removed still others were killed by being hit several times over the head Some were even buried alive Animals that were considered sacred and represented mythical powers and military might were also buried alive They were imprisoned in cages though Cougars a wolf eagles a falcon an owl and even venomous snakes were among those found

The citys broad central avenue called Avenue of the Dead is flanked by impressive ceremonial architecture including the immense Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon Along the Avenue of the Dead are many smaller talud tablero platforms The Aztecs believed they were tombs inspiring the name of the avenue Now they are known to be ceremonial platforms that were topped with temples Further down the Avenue of the Dead is the area known as the Citadel containing the ruined Temple of the Feathered Serpent This area was a large plaza surrounded by temples that formed the religious and political center of the city The name Citadel was given to it by the Spanish who believed it was a fort Many of the rich and powerful Teotihuacanos lived in Palaces near the temples the largest of these covering more than 3300 m Most of the common people lived in large apartment buildings spread across the city Many of the buildings contained workshops that produced pottery and other goods 

The geographical layout of Teotihuacn is a good example of the Mesoamerican tradition of planning cities settlements and buildings as a representation of the Teotihuacano view of the Universe Its urban grid is aligned to precisely 155 east of North The Street of the Dead in particular seems to line up with Cerro Gordo to the north of the Pyramid of the Moon Pecked cross circles throughout the city and in the surrounding regions indicate how the grid was managed over long distances

Knowledge of the great ruins of Teotihuacn was never lost After the fall of the city various squatters lived on the site During Aztec times the city was a place of pilgrimage and identified with the myth of Tollan the place where the sun was created Teotihuacn astonished the Spanish conquistadores during the post conquest era Today Teotihuacn is one of the most noted archaeological attractions in Mexico 

Minor archaeological excavations were conducted in the 19th century and in 1905 major projects of excavation and restoration began under archaeologist Leopoldo Batres The Pyramid of the Sun was restored to celebrate the centennial of Mexican Independence in 1910 Major programs of excavation and restoration were carried out in 1960 65 and 1980 82 Recent projects at the Pyramid of the Moon and the Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent have greatly expanded evidence of cultural practices Teotihuacn features museums and reconstructed structures

The first sign of dangers was the appearance on the plain of bands of Kurds from the regions north and east Villages were attacked looted and burned while the villagers were killed or scattered For a time the marauders seemed to hold aloof from the city itself but as they kept on their course of pillage their appetite for plunder was whetted and they looked with avaricious eyes at the city on the hill 

The Tour de Pologne is a road bicycle racing stage race It consists of seven or eight stages and was first held in 1928 Until 1952 the race was not held every year but since then there has been a Tour annually When Eastern Europe was communist controlled there were no professional cyclists so until the early 1990s the race was for amateurs only and the winners mostly came from Poland

Although the Tour de Pologne had not reached a high status and was little known the International Cycling Union decided to make it a part of the UCI ProTour from 2005 which means that the major cycling teams compete in the race

The Tanos were pre Columbian indigenous people that came from the Caribbean coast of South America going northward to the island chain of the Lesser Antilles to the Greater Antilles around 1200 CE

When Christopher Columbus came to the Americas the Tanos were living in the Bahamas the Greater Antilles and some islands of the northern Lesser Antilles They had a culture different from that of the Arawaks of South America They were the first people that the Spanish met in the Americas

The name Tano was given by Columbus when he met some native men and they said Tano Tano meaning We are good noble Columbus thought that Tano was the name of the people

Rouse divides the Tanos into three main groups Classic Tano from Hispaniola and Puerto Rico Western Tano or sub Tano from Jamaica Cuba and the Bahamas and Eastern Tano from the Virgin Islands to Montserrat

The Tanos of the Bahamas were known as the Lucayan Lucayos were Tanos but with a culture less developed and archeologists call them as sub Tanos

The ancestors of the Tanos went from the center of the Amazon Basin to the Orinoco valley From there they got to the Caribbean islands through Guyana and Venezuela

Another theory says that the ancestors of the Tanos came from the Colombian Andes

The Tano culture developed in the Greater Antilles

Tano society was divided into two classes naborias and nitanos These were governed by chiefs known as caciques There were also bohiques

The Tanos lived in villages called yucayeques those in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico were the largest and those in the Bahamas were the smallest villages They built large round houses called bohio where several families lived The cacique and his family lived in a rectangular house called caney They slept on cotton hammocks

They played a ball game called batey Batey was also the name of the place where they played and had dances The cacique sat on a chair of wood called duho or dujo

When a musician auditions for a job in an orchestra they will have to prepare a piece of music they know well They may also be expected to have prepared difficult passages from well known musical works eg someone auditioning for tuned percussion might be asked to play the xylophone introduction to Summer Time from Porgy and Bess one of the hardest solos for xylophone They will also be given some sightreading

People can audition to sing in a choir Dancers can audition for dancing companies

In some cases people who pass an audition are still not automatically a member of a group until they have performed with the group for a trial period

Remus Lupin is a character in the Harry Potter book series written by J K Rowling

Lupin was bitten by a werewolf when he was very young His parents were both upset by this because it meant he could not go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry However when Albus Dumbledore became headmaster he let Lupin go to Howgwarts He had a tunnel built so that Lupin could sneak out of the school during the times when he became a werewolf This tunnel had the Whomping Willow built over it so nobody could get to him by mistake The tunnel led to the Shrieking Shack a building in the wizarding village of Hogsmeade When Lupin was in the Shrieking Shack as a werewolf he had no humans to bite so he often bit himself These bites led to cries of pain that led the villagers to think that the building was haunted

During his time at Hogwarts he became good friends with three other boys his age James Potter Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew These four came to be known as the marauders infamous for their mischievous antics They knew Hogwarts and the grounds like the back of their hands and actually created a magical map that showed the location of everyone on the grounds and in the building The map also revealed the many secret passages hidden in the school His friends knew of his lycanthropy but did not seem to mind They simply referred to it as his furry little problem Later on they even became animagi so that they could accompany him on the full moon and make his transformations more enjoyable

He was a wizard during Voldemorts first and second rises to power He was member of the First and Second Order of the Phoenix and taught as the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor in the 1993 94 school year at Hogwarts He quit at the end of the year when Severus Snape let it slip to students that he was a werewolf

An anagram is a puzzle where the player has to move all the letters in a word to make a new word An example would be The Morse Code and Here Comes Dots Anagrams are often used in fiction when a character wants to use a different name For example the Harry Potter character named Tom Marvolo Riddle made an anagram based on his name I Am Lord Voldemort and began calling himself Lord Voldermort

A werewolf is a mythical monster It is a human who turns into a fearsome wolf like creature during the full moon There are characteristics that make werewolves special and that allow a person to tell them apart from real wolves such as the eyes shape and tail When in human form werewolves look and act like any normal human being although they usually appear to be ill around nights were there is a full moon When in wolf form the werewolf does not keep the mind of the human and it cannot resist attacking humans the werewolf may attack their best friends A werewolf can be killed with silver bullets However a werewolf cannot be killed by silver crosses or holy water like vampires When a werewolf dies it turns back into a human It is said that humans can be turned into werewolves by having been bitten by another werewolf

The name is derived from wer meaning man and wulf meaning wolf

Some of the earliest myths of werewolves are those of Greek and Romania roots Ovid in the Metamorphoses told of King Lycaeon who was visited by gods Skeptical of them being true gods he decided to test them by serving human flesh in their banquet of honor Cannibalism is frowned upon in many parts of the world past or present When the gods discovered the tainted meal they changed King Lycaeon into a Werewolf Since he obviously liked human flesh the wolven form would be more acceptable for when he took part in his little activity The word Lycanthropy originates from greek roots

The Paneuropean Picnic was an event that took place on the border between Austria and Hungary near Sopron Hungary The event took place on August 19 1989

The event was planned to be a peaceful demonstration Both countries agreed to open a gate in the border fence between Sankt Margarethen im Burgenland and Sopronkhida on the Hungarian side of the border 

The leaders of the time were Otto von Habsburg and the Hungarian minister Imre Pozsgay The person who did the actual cutting of the border fence was the general secretary of the International Paneuropean Union Walburga Habsburg Douglas The gate was to be symbolically opened for three hours 

More than 600 citizens of the German Democratic Republic took the chance to cross into the west once the Iron Curtain was opened They had been told about the event by its organizers At that time the Hungarian border police still had orders to shoot anyone trying to cross the border illegally However they acted carefully and did not shoot at the fleeing people this time

The number of people who actually crossed the border to enter the west was only a few hundred on that first day On the following days the border was watched more closely due to orders by the Hungarian government Therefore a smaller number of people managed to flee then Hungary opened its borders to citizens of East Germany on September 11 1989

Today the Paneuropean Picnic is seen as one of the important events that led to the end of the German Democratic Republic and the Cold War the fall of the Iron Curtain and the unification of the two German states 

The event is celebrated every year on August 19 on the spot where the border was opened 

Today artwork made by Hungarian artists is at the place where the fence was cut It shows a partly opened door 

In 1996 a 10 meter statue was built in Fertrkos near Sopron It was made by Gabriela von Habsburg It shows a piece of barbed wire From far away it looks like a cross

Risk is a board game which is played with two to six players each with different coloured army men

The main aim of the game is to complete the mission the player gets in the beginning of the game These missions can differ from conquering or dominating parts of the world to kill an other player or to hold a number of regions with a specific ammount of units on each region

At the start of the game a player shuffles and deals out all of the cards Each cards has either a country or a territory on it When each player receives their cards they put a soldier on their countries or territories After they do this they get a number of soldiers cavalries and cannons to spread around according to which continent they want to conquer first Then they hand their cards back and they put them all face down on top of each other Then the game starts

Roll the red dice to attack and the white dice to defend At the end of each turn pick a card With this card look at the country or territory and the soldier cavalry or cannon If someone conquers the country or territory on the card it belongs to him For every country a player owned they get two extra soldiers

1 Cannon is equal to

1 Cavalry equals 

There are many countries and territories involved such as the following which can change depending on the version

Growth means an increase in some quantity over time 

The quantity can be physical or abstract It can also refer to the mode of growth ie numeric models for describing how much a particular quantity grows over time 

Cell growth is shorthand for the idea of growth in cell populations by means of cell reproduction

It is the stage which cells are preparing for the next division biochemical activities and reactions are taking place however no obvious changes can be seen at this stage Until cell division a parent cell divides to form two or more new daughter cells

Cell populations go through a type of exponential growth called doubling Thus each generation of cells should be twice as numerous as the previous generation But not all cells survive in each generation as written by Richard Dawkins in 1997

Cell reproduction is asexual

The process of cell reproduction has three major parts The first part of cell reproduction involves the replication of the parental cells DNA The second major issue is the separation of the duplicated DNA into two equally sized groups of chromosomes The third major aspect of cell reproduction is the physical division of entire cells usually called cytokinesis

Cell reproduction is more complex in eukaryotes than in other organisms Prokaryotic cells such as bacterial cells reproduce by binary fission a process that includes DNA replication chromosome segregation and cytokinesis Eukaryotic cell reproduction either involves mitosis or a more complex process called meiosis Mitosis and meiosis are sometimes called the two nuclear division processes 

The DNA content of a cell is duplicated at the start of the cell reproduction process Prior to DNA replication the DNA content of a cell can be represented as the amount Z After the DNA replication process the amount of DNA in the cell is 2Z During Binary fission and mitosis the duplicated DNA content of the reproducing parental cell is separated into two equal halves that are broken wikt linkdestinedestined to end up in the two daughter cells The final part of the cell reproduction process is cell division when daughter cells physically split apart from a parental cell During meiosis there are two cell division steps that together produce the four daughter cells 

Immediately after DNA replication a human cell will have 46 double chromosomes In each double chromosome there are two copies of that chromosomes DNA molecule During mitosis the double chromosomes are split to produce 92 single chromosomes half of which go into each daughter cell During meiosis there are two chromosome separation steps which assure that each of the four daughter cells gets one copy of each of the 23 types of chromosome

Cell reproduction that uses mitosis can reproduce eukaryotic cells Eukaryotes bother with the more complicated process of meiosis because sexual reproduction such as meiosis confers a broken wikt linkselectiveselective advantage

DNA replication is the process of copying a double stranded DNA molecule Both strands serve as templates for the reproduction of the opposite strand This process occurs in all life forms with DNA There are some differences in the control of DNA replication in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms 

In a cell DNA replication begins at specific places in the genome called origins As the DNA unwinds at the origin the synthesis of new strands forms at a replication fork In addition to DNA polymerase other enzymes at the fork help to start and continue the DNA synthesis

DNA polymerases are a family of enzymes that carry out all forms of DNA replication However a DNA polymerase can only extend an existing DNA strand paired with a template strand it cannot begin the synthesis of a new strand To begin synthesis a short fragment of DNA or RNA called a primer is created and paired with the template DNA strand

In general DNA polymerases are extremely accurate making less than one mistake for every 107 nucleotides added Even so some DNA polymerases also have proofreading ability they can remove nucleotides from the end of a strand in order to correct mismatched bases

The 1904 Summer Olympics officially known as the Games of the III Olympiad were held in St Louis Missouri in the United States from July 1 1904 to November 23 1904 at what is now known as Francis Field on the campus of Washington University in St Louis Chicago had won the original bid to host the games but the Louisiana Purchase Exposition would not accept another international event in the same time frame The organization began to plan for its own sports activities informing the Chicago Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games that the Exposition would try to make the Olympic Games less important than the Exposition games unless the Olympic Games were moved to St Louis Pierre de Coubertin the founder of the modern Olympic movement finally agreed

St Louis repeated the mistakes made at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris Competitions were reduced to a side show of the Worlds Fair and were lost in the chaos of other more popular cultural exhibits David Francis the President of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition did not invite anybody else to open the games and on July 1 1904 did so himself in a small short ceremony

Officially the games lasted for months in fact James Edward Sullivan tried to hold an event every day of the fair The Olympic events were again mixed with other sporting events but unlike Paris who hardly ever mentioned the Olympics Sullivan called all his sports events Olympic From these events the International Olympic Committee declared 94 of them to be Olympic A total of 651 athletes competed in the games645 men and 6 women representing 12 countries In fact only 42 of the events actually included athletes who were not from the United States The majority of the recognized Olympic sports were held from Monday August 29 to Saturday September 3 1904

Elliss father was a general manager of the Metropolitan Railway in London He went to Harrow School where he was very good at all subjects as well as sport In 1913 he become a cadet in the Royal Military Academy He wanted to join the Royal Engineers 

He was on holiday in Germany the next summer when World War I broke out  All British people who were in Germany were sent to the Ruhleben POW Camp just outside Berlin The place where the detainees were held had been a horse racecourse There were lots of stables and in each stable there were 27 horse boxes which became the detainees home during the war The detainees were allowed to do lots of things to keep themselves busy They could get books and Ellis made good use of his time to study Another detainee in the camp was the scientist James Chadwick Chadwick taught Ellis a lot and together they made a laboratory in one of the horse stables where they made scientific experiments on the photochemical process

After the war Ellis decided to study at Trinity College Cambridge After graduating in 1920 he did research work at the Cavendish Laboratory Cambridge The director there was Sir Ernest Rutherford Chadwick also worked there  In 1921 Ellis had become a fellow of Trinity College and was made assistant lecturer in natural science In 1925 he married the daughter of a wealthy Polish shipbuilder In 1929 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society

In 1930 Rutherford Chadwick and Ellis wrote a famous book together called Radiations from Radioactive Substances

During the early 1930s Ellis worked with NFMott on energy relations in beta decay He discovered the neutrino and worked with WJHenderson on the energy distribution of positrons in artificial radioactivity He became professor at the University of London

During World War II he worked on the possibility of using nuclear fission to develop new weapons He became scientific adviser to the army council from 1943 1946 He was knighted in 1946 for his war service

After World War II Ellis had other jobs which were not related to nuclear weapons He gave scientific advice to the National Coal Board and to the British American Tobacco Company This was at a time when people were just starting to realize that smoking might be bad for the health

Ellis died in 1980 in a nursing home in Cookham after a short illness

James Chadwick was born in Bollington Cheshire England He went to Manchester High School and studied at the Universities of Manchester and Cambridge In 1913 Chadwick went to Berlin in Germany to work with the scientist Hans Geiger He also worked with Ernest Rutherford He was still in Germany when World War I broke out and he was interned in Ruhleben POW Camp just outside Berlin The camp which had more than 5000 detainees had been a horse race course There were stables each with 27 horse boxes The detainees lived in these boxes The detainees were allowed to do things to keep themselves busy Chadwick worked with a young scientist called Charles Ellis Together they set up a laboratory in the stables where they worked on the ionisation of phosphorus and also on the photo chemical reaction of carbon monoxide and chlorine

After the war Chadwick returned to Cambridge where he worked with Ernest Rutherford studying the emission of gamma rays from radioactive materials They also studied the transmutation of elements by bombarding them with alpha particles and investigated the nature of the atomic nucleus

In 1932 Chadwick made a very important discovery he discovered the particle in the nucleus of an atom that became known as the neutron because it has no electric charge In contrast with the helium nuclei which are positively charged and therefore repelled by the strong electrical forces in the nuclei of heavy atoms this new tool in atomic disintegration need not overcome any electric barrier and is capable of penetrating and splitting the nuclei of even the heaviest elements In this way Chadwick prepared the way towards the fission of uranium 235 and towards the creation of the atomic bomb For this important discovery he was awarded the Hughes Medal of the Royal Society in 1932 and later the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1935 He was also nicknamed Jimmy Neutron because of his discovery of the neutron

Chadwick became professor of physics at Liverpool University in 1935 He worked on the possibility of an atomic bomb Later he realized that the nuclear bomb really was going to be made He found it very frightening that the science he had been working on could lead to such a terrible weapon He started to take sleeping pills

He joined the Manhattan Project in the United States which developed the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki Chadwick was knighted in 1945

After the war Chadwick moved to Cambridge University as master of Gonville and Caius College

He died in Cambridge on 24 July 1974

Francombat is a French martial art similar to jiu jitsu It was created in the year 1988 by Alain Basset and Dominique Dumolin 

Francombat is practiced especially in the south of France There are schools of francombat in Paris Bordeaux Montpellier and in other localities

This martial art is based on the strategy and on the knowledge of the human body During the trainings the instructors are dressed in red clothes and the students are dressed in green ones According to the persons that practice this discipline the efficiency in combat depends on three factors good physical form good knowledge of the techniques and of the strategy good control of stress 

The training of francombat is based on 

The classic cycle races are the most important one day professional cycling road races in the international calendar

All of the races are run in western Europe Most of the events have been on the professional calendar for decades and the oldest ones date back to the 19th Century They are normally held at roughly the same time each year In the last few years the five top races are sometimes described as the Monuments

From 2005 the Classics have formed part of the UCI ProTour run by the Union Cycliste Internationale This event series also includes various stage races including the Tour de France Giro dItalia Vuelta a Espaa Paris Nice and the Critrium de Dauphin Libr and various non Classic single day events The ProTour replaced the UCI Road World Cup series which contained only one day races

Some races that were Classics are no longer run These include the gruelling 560km Derny event Bordeaux Paris run from 1891 to 1988

Five of the classic races are sometimes called the Monuments

Only three riders have won all five Monument one day races during their careers Roger De Vlaeminck Rik Van Looy and Eddy Merckx All were from Belgium

Sen Kelly of Ireland won four Monuments but only finished second in the Ronde van Vlaanderen on three occasions

A criterium or crit is a type of bicycle race held on a short course often run on closed off city centre streets

Race length can be either a time or a number of laps Often a criterium lasts about one hour which is shorter than that of a traditional road race which can last many hours sometimes of several days or even weeks as in a Grand Tour However the average speed and is much higher The winner is the first rider to cross the finish line without having been lapped

Events often have prizes for winning specific intermediate laps

Winning criteriums needs a mix of good technical skills especially the ability to corner rapidly and sharply and riding safely with a large group on a short circuit and exceptional fitness to attack other riders and repeatedly accelerate hard from corners

Criteriums are relatively easy to organize and do not require a large amount of space They are the most common type of bicycle racing in the continental United States

Racing bicycles used for criteriums are typically no different than those used in other mass start road events However some racers use shorter bicycles to help keep control when turning and slightly shorter cranks to help pedalling through sharp turns

In chemistry valence electrons are the electrons in the outside or valence electron shell of an atom Valence electrons are important in how a chemical element reacts with other elements Elements which have eight valence electrons are inert and they do not tend to create chemical reactions with other elements in the Periodic table group The number of valence electrons is also important for determining the group of an element in the Periodic table because an elements number of valence electron is the same as the number of its group in the periodic table 

Flamingos are types of birds They are noisy birds and they live in big groups called flocks Flamingos are wading birds This means they live by water such as lakes 

They are in the genus Phoenicopterus and family Phoenicopteridae There are six species of Flamingo Two of species are found in Africa Europe and Asia The other four are found in North America and South America 

Flamingos are pink or red This is because of small bacteria that live in water which the Flamingos eat They also eat small shrimp Baby Flamingos are gray Flamingos are very tall birds and they have long legs They often stand on only one leg Scientists do not know why Flamingos do this Flamingos have a curved bill that is shaped like a banana This is because they feed in the mud on the bottom of lakes

Many Flamingos that live in Kenya and Tanzania are dying Scientists do not know why They think it may be because of bacteria in the water

Magnesium oxide or magnesia is a white solid mineral made of one part magnesium and one part oxygen Its chemical formula is MgO Magnesium oxide is used by libraries to make books last longer It is also used as an insulator for some electrical wires and to help crucibles resist high temperatures Magnesium oxide is also used to treat heartburn and upset stomachs

A movie studio or film studio is a place where movies are made A movie studio can be an area where the movie is filmed like an indoor stage or room or an outdoor area in which only those making the movie are allowed to be

The term movie studio also means a production company because these companies often had  in the 1920s to the 1940s  their own studios in their own buildings Even though most production companies do not now have their own studios the term is still used in this way

The Critrium du Dauphin Libr is an annual cycling road race run over eight stages in the Dauphin region in France during the first half of June It is organised by the Le Dauphin Libr newspaper Along with the Tour de Suisse the Dauphin Libr is an important race in the lead up to the Tour de France in July

Because the Dauphin is a mountainous area the winners are often climbing specialists Many climbs that are famous from the Tour de France like the Mont Ventoux the Col du Galibier or Col de la Chartreuse appear often in the Dauphin Libr 

All cyclists who have won the Tour de France five times or more have also won the Dauphin Libr

The first Dauphin Libr was held in 1947 when Eduard Klablinski from Poland was the winner Nello Lauredi Luis Ocaa Charly Mottet and Bernard Hinault share the record of the most wins with three each

Lance Armstrong used the Dauphin Libr as preparation for the Tour de France He won the Dauphin in 2002 and 2003 but was defeated by Iban Mayo in 2004 who climbed Mont Ventoux very quickly Armstrong finished 4th in the 2005 Dauphin finishing 59 seconds off the pace of overall winner Iigo Landaluze of the Euskaltel Euskadi team

The 1900 Summer Olympics officially known as the Games of the II Olympiad were held in 1900 in Paris France No opening or closing ceremonies were held but competitions began on May 14 and ended on October 28 The Games were held as part of the 1900 Worlds Fair Over a thousand athletes competed in 19 different sports Women took part in the games for the first time and Charlotte Cooper became the first female Olympic champion Many American athletes opposed competing on a Sunday because they travelled as representatives of their colleges and were expected to withdraw rather than compete on the sabbath

Most of the winners in 1900 were given cups or trophies instead of medals Professionals competed in fencing and Albert Robert Ayat who won the pe for amateurs and masters was awarded a prize of 3000 francs

The 1998 Winter Olympics officially known as the XVIII Olympic Winter Games were celebrated in 1998 in Nagano Japan Other possible host cities were Aosta Italy Jaca Spain stersund Sweden and Salt Lake City USA The selection was held in Birmingham United Kingdom in 1991

Mont Ventoux is a mountain in the Provence region of southern France about 20 km north east of Carpentras Vaucluse 

It is the largest mountain in the region and has the nicknames Giant of Provence and The Bald Mountain 

Jean Buridan climbed the mountain early in the fourteenth century Petrarch repeated the feat on April 26 1336 and claimed to have been the first to climb a mountain since antiquity which has been widely repeated since 

In the 15th century a chapel was built on the top It was dedicated to the Holy Cross

In 1882 a meteorological station was constructed on the summit but it is not used now In the 1960s a 50m high telecommunications mast was built

For road bicycle racing enthusiasts the mountain can be climbed by three roads 

Every year there are amateur races to climb the mountain as quickly and often as possible in 24 hours On May 16 2006 Jean Pascal Roux from Bdoin broke the record of climbs in 24 hours with eleven climbs all of them from Bdoin 

Mont Ventoux is the one of the most gruelling climbs in the Tour de France The Tour has visited the mountain thirteen times since 1951 The route is usually the Bdoin

British cyclist Tom Simpson who died here on July 13 1967 from a combination of amphetamines alcohol and heat exhaustion He began to weave across the road before he fell down twice He was delirious but his last words were not put me back on my bike that was what a journalist wrote

Amphetamines were found in his jersey and bloodstream There is a memorial to Simpson near the summit which has become a shrine to fans of cycling who often leave small tokens of remembrance there In 1970 Eddy Merckx rode himself to the brink of collapse but won the stage He received oxygen recovered and won the Tour In 1994 Eros Poli not known for his climbing ability stole away at the beginning of the days stage built up a big time gap from the peloton and was first over the Ventoux and was the stage winner despite The last winner on the Ventoux was the French climber Richard Virenque

The 1968 Winter Olympics officially known as the X Olympic Winter Games were celebrated in 1968 Grenoble France and opened on February 6 Thirty seven countries participated Norway won the most medals the first time a country other than the USSR had done so since the USSR first entered the Winter Games in 1956

Frenchman Jean Claude Killy won three gold medals in all the alpine skiing events In womens figure skating Peggy Fleming won the only United States gold medal The games have been credited with making the Winter Olympics more popular in the United States largely because of ABCs coverage of Fleming and Killy who became very popular among teenage girls

1968 was the first year that the International Olympic Committee let East and West Germany enter separately and the first time the IOC ever ordered drug and gender testing of the athletes

The 1964 Winter Olympics officially known as the IX Olympic Winter Games were celebrated in Innsbruck Austria from January 29 to February 9 1964 The games included 1091 athletes from 36 nations and the Olympic Torch was carried by Joseph Rieder a former alpine skier who had participated in the 1956 Winter Olympics

The games were affected by the deaths of Australian alpine skier Ross Milne and a British luge slider during training and by the deaths 3 years earlier of the entire US figure skating team and family members

Counterculture is a term used in psychology and sociology People use it to describe a set of views that are not of the mainstream These values are in contrast to what the mainstream people believe An example of a counterculture that was started in the 1960s is the culture of the hippies This counterculture focused on drug use sexual freedom and womens rights 

A hippie is a label for a person of a certain counterculture that started in the United States and spread to other countries in the 1960s 

Hippies have their own views on drug use sexual liberation and womens rights 

The first people to be called hippies were young adults and teenagers in the 1960s who grew out of the beatnik movement These people were supporters of civil rights for African Americans in the Southern USA They soon developed their own music scene in neighborhoods in New York City and San Francisco They were also strongly against the Vietnam War nuclear weapons and what they called the Establishment They were also against the military industrial complex This phrase was taken from a warning in the farewell speech of President Dwight Eisenhower in 1961

Many more people began to see hippies in the news after the Human Be In and the 1967 Summer of Love were held in San Francisco By this time they had developed their own lifestyle that included psychedelic styles drug use usually some amount of travel and much longer hair than other people These styles quickly spread across the country especially to college campuses where students were protesting President Lyndon Johnsons policies in Vietnam the assassination of Dr Martin Luther King Jr in 1968 and other events They also spread to the UK Netherlands France Italy Germany Australia New Zealand and Canada among other places 

In 1968 many more Americans turned against the war following the Tet Offensive King was shot and politicians began to get ready for the election for President in November Many colleges were shut down by students and people burned their draft cards at public rallies A group of radical hippies called the Yippies led by Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin led a huge protest during the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago where they tried to run a pig called Pigasus as a candidate for President The mayor responded by sending in riot police who beat people up in front of news cameras The riot police even beat the cameramen reporters and other innocent people This was shown on the news and many programs and television stations began to feel more sympathetic to the hippies This made hippie lifestyle much more mainstream through the early seventies 

In 1969 Richard Nixon succeeded Johnson as President and protests continued not just against the war but against the court trials and hearings of the Yippie leaders who became known as the Chicago Seven Also in that year a huge rock concert was held in Bethel New York the three day Woodstock Festival At this festival 500000 hippies and music fans heard some of the most famous singers and groups of the time The people there also did wild behavior like nudism nude swimming mud sliding rain dancing and mass tribal chants They did this to show their freedom to the world 

Late that year a murderer named Charles Manson who posed as a hippie killed several people Because some people blamed hippies for this the term began to fall a little out of fashion in 1970 even if the fashions themselves did not A new type of hard rock called heavy metal was developing out of one style of hippie music A band called Led Zeppelin took the number one spot for most popular band of the year in 1970 which had been held by the Beatles for eight years Also that year students at Kent State University in Ohio were protesting Nixons spread of bombing to Laos When the were protesting the National Guard shot at them and four were killed This had a chilling effect on the hippies and the whole country but the peace movement continued In 1973 the draft was ended and the war ended soon after that US public attention turned to the Watergate scandal After this hippies never again had the attention they once did though the lifestyle continued especially in other countries In the mid seventies trends like punks and disco were also spreading causing the hippie image to fade in the media

Tom Simpson was an English road racing cyclist who died of exhaustion on the slopes of Mont Ventoux riding the 13th stage of the Tour de France in 1967

The post mortem found that he had taken amphetamines Added to brandyl the hard climb up Mont Ventoux the hot conditions and a stomach complaint the doping was fatal

Simpson was the youngest of the six children  He was born in Haswell County Durham After World War II the Simpson family moved to Harworth in north Nottinghamshire another mining village where Simpson grew up and became interested in cycling He attended the village school and later Worksop Technical College and in 1954 was an apprentice draughtsman at an engineering company in Retford

As a cyclist he joined first Harworth and District Cycling Club and later Rotherhams Scala Wheelers and by his late teens was winning local time trials He was then advised to try track cycling and he travelled regularly to Fallowfield Stadium in Manchester to compete He won medals in the national 4000m individual pursuit discipline 

When he was 19 Simpson was part of the Great Britain team pursuit squad which won a bronze medal at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne Australia Two years later he won a silver medal in the individual pursuit at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff

In April 1959 Simpson went to France to live in the Breton fishing port of Saint Brieuc He hoped to win enough local amateur races to get noticed by a professional cycling team It was in Saint Brieuc that he met Helen Sherburn They married on 3 January 1960

Within two months Simpson had won five races and in July 1959 was offered terms by two professional teams he decided to join the Rapha Geminiani team which already had a British cyclist Brian Robinson in its squad His first event as a professional was a small stage race the Tour de lOuest He won two stages and finished 18th overall  a major achievement for a new pro who would normally be expected to be a domestique to the teams leader

He competed in the 1959 World Championships in the Netherlands in the individual pursuit and professional road race finishing fourth in both events Simpson turned down an invitation to ride in the 1959 Tour de France because he thought he was not ready He rode in the 1960 Tour and finished 29th and was third in stage 3 

In 1960 he also competed in his first Classic races he had top ten finishes in La Flche Wallonne and Paris Roubaix  he led the Paris Roubaix for around 40km before running out of energy and being overtaken less than 10k from the finish ending up 9th

In April 1961 however Simpson won his first Classic He won the tough Ronde van Vlaanderen after a two man sprint at the finish That year he also finished 5th in the Race to the Sun  the Paris Nice stage race and 9th in the world championship but he abandoned the Tour de France on stage 3 because of an earlier knee injury

In 1962 he became the first Briton to wear the maillot jaune and eventually finished 6th overall That was highest final placing by a Briton until Robert Millar was fourth in 1984 Simpson had been third until a crash 

Earlier in the season he again showed how much he likied for the tough Belgian Classic races Simpson finished 5th in the Ronde van Vlaanderen and 6th in the Gent Wevelgem

1963 and 1965 were probably Simpsons best years for Classic races  He was riding for the Peugeot BP team in 1963 when he won the gruelling motor paced event Bordeaux Paris was second in Paris Brussels and Paris Tours third in the Ronde van Vlaanderen 8th in Paris Roubaix and 10th in both La Flche Wallonne and Giro di Lombardia

In 1965 Simpson became the first Briton to be world professional road racing champion

In 1967 he won the early season Paris Nice stage race and the Tour of Sardinia He also rode in the Vuelta a Espaa for the first time collecting two stage victories en route to an eventual 33rd place overall

At the start of the 1967 Tour de France Simpson thought that he could do well in the event After the first week he was sixth overall but a stomach bug began to affect his form and he lost vital time in a stage including the Col du Galibier In Marseille at the start of stage 13 on Thursday 13 July he was still suffering the bad stomach as the race headed into Provence on a blisteringly hot day

On the days main climb Mont Ventoux Simpson broke away early but was soon passed by the eventual stage winner Julio Jimnez and four others About two kilometres from the summit Simpson began to zig zag across the road eventually falling against an embankment While his team car helpers wanted him to retire from the race Simpson insisted on carrying on He went another 500m or so before again beginning to fall he toppled unconscious into the arms of his helpers Despite mouth to mouth resuscitation and the administration of oxygen plus a helicopter airlift to a nearby hospital Simpson died Two tubes of amphetamines and more empty tube were found in the rear pocket of his racing jersey

On the next day the other riders did not want to race so soon after Simpsons death and asked the organisers for a postponement In the end they agreed to ride but with the condition that they would allow a British rider to win the stage This honour went to Barry Hoban Hoban later married Simpsons widow

British cyclists paid for a granite memorial to Simpson near the spot where he died 

Harry Hall the team mechanic said that Simpsons last wordswere Go on go on The ords Put me back on my bike were invented by Sid Saltmarsh a journalist writing about the Tour for The Sun Saltmarsh was not present at Simpsons death

Simpsons is buried in Harworth cemetery A small museum about him was opened in August 2001 by Tour de France legend Lucien van Impe in the Harworth social club A small version of the Mont Ventoux Simpson Memorial was put outside that club in 1997 to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Simpsonss death

Simpsons professional achievements include four Classic one day victories

In addition to these victories Simpson frequently finished in the top ten of Classics and won numerous criteriums and other events

As an amateur he also won an Olympic Games team pursuit bronze medal silver in the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games individual pursuit silver and gold medals in the British 4000m individual pursuit championship and was British League of Racing Cyclists hill climb champion in 1957 picking up a silver medal in the same event the following year

In chemistry and nuclear physics the electron cloud is a way to describe where electrons are when they go around the nucleus of an atom The electron cloud model is different from the older model by Niels Bohr Bohr talked about electrons going around the nucleus in a fixed circle the same way that planets go around the Sun The electron cloud model says that we can not know exactly where an electron is but the electrons are more likely to be in specific areas of an atom It is the most modern and accepted form of the atom

In the Bohr model electrons were assigned to different shells These shells explained the repeating patterns of chemical properties in the periodic table Using quantum mechanics chemists can use the electron cloud model to assign electrons to different atomic orbitals These atomic orbitals are not all spheres Atomic orbitals also explain the patterns in the periodic table

9 1 1 or 911 is the emergency telephone number for the United States Canada and Argentina This number can only be used for real emergencies In other words you use it when you are in serious trouble The use of the number when there is no emergency may end in a criminal charge

An emergency is a situation in which a risk to health life property or environment is about to happen Most emergencies need quick attention to prevent it from becoming worse Even though some emergencies are easy to see like a natural disaster many smaller incidents need the opinion of someone who is watching in order to decide whether it is really an emergency The exact definition of an emergency the agencies involved and the rules followed depend on the jurisdiction and this is usually set by the government whose agencies are responsible for emergency planning and handling

Post Mortem are two Latin words which mean after death

Especially in Britain post mortem is the usual name to describe the examination of a body to see if doctors can find the cause of death In the United States this is called an autopsy It got the name because it is the examination done after death

The term Sexual revolution was coined by Wilhelm Reich in his book The Sexual Revolution That book was first published in 1945 Reich wrote in the book what he saw as wrong namely the double standard regarding morals in the society of his time These double standards and the suppression of the sex drive would make people different This would lead to a buildup of aggressions and frustration 

Freeing the sex drive would lead to a peaceful change of society according to Reich 

These ideas meant that some people in the 1960s radically changed their views regarding sex They were very open minded about it The publications of people like Alfred Kinsey helped give wings to the movement

Boy was Irish rock group U2s first album from the year 1980

Before this album came a single a song that is played on its own called I Will Follow It was very popular and was played on college radio stations and made people know who U2 were People mostly thought of I Will Follow as a Christian song showing how all of the members of U2 were Christians but none of the band members has said that that is true This album is somewhat about Bonos life as a child and his mothers death when he was 14

At first the producer of band Joy Division Martin Hannett was supposed to produce the album but he was sad about the suicide of Ian Curtis so he did not help record the album It was produced by Steve Lillywhite and recorded in a Dublin studio called Windmill Lane Studios Some songs were written in the studio like An Cat Dubh and The Ocean Some other songs had already been written and U2 were performing them often like the songs Stories for Boys Out of Control and Twilight The Edge U2s guitarist recorded all of the songs using his Gibson Explorer guitar and his Fender Stratocaster guitar

Boy reached 63 on the Billboard album charts a list of the most popular albums in the US and was not on the popularity charts in the United Kingdom The song I Will Follow reached 20 on a popularity chart called the Mainstream rock charts People said that their live shows were too predictable and that Bono the singer used too much echo in his singing but their playing showed that they could play very well People also said that Bono was a charismatic and passionate singer meaning that he sang very emotionally and that people could connect to him Boy is the only U2 album that every song has been played live including all of the b sides On the list of the 500 greatest albums of all time made by the rock magazine Rolling Stone Boy was 417th on the list

The boy on the cover of the album is a boy named Peter Rowan Rowan is the brother of Bonos friend Guggi and he is a famous Irish photographer He has been on other U2 album covers including Three and War The person who took the picture has made other U2 covers too In case that the band could be blamed for pedophilia they changed the cover to a stretched picture of the four band members

All of the songs were written by U2 and all of the lyrics were written by Bono

There were two singles released from this album They were I Will Follow and A Day Without Me The album that came before Boy was called Three On very early copies of Boy there is a 30 second instrumental piece that is am early version of Fire which was on a later album called October

Ergastic substances are non protoplasm materials that one can find in cells The living protoplasm of a cell is sometimes called the bioplasm and something else than the ergastic substances of the cell 

These are usually organic or inorganic substances that are products of metabolism and include crystals oil drops gums tannins resins and other compounds that can help the organism in defense maintenance of cellular structure or just substance storage During the lifetime of a cell these can appear and disappear They indicate some level of participation in life processes Ergastic substances may appear in the protoplasm in vacuoles or in the cell wall

Adenine is one of the basic molecules which form DNA and RNA They are usually called bases in genetics 

In DNA adenine sticks to thymine with two hydrogen bonds to help in making the nucleic acid structures stronger In RNA which is used in the cytoplasm for protein synthesis adenine sticks to uracil

Adenine was sometimes called Vitamin B4 but no longer However two B vitamins niacin and riboflavin bind with adenine to form the essential cofactors NAD and FAD respectively

Some think that at the origin of life on Earth the first adenine was formed by the polymerization of five hydrogen cyanide molecules This is not generally agreed

Year 888 was a leap year starting on Monday of the Gregorian calendar

An atlas is a collection of maps or manifolds traditionally bound into book form but also found in multimedia formats 

It may show geographic features and political boundaries but often social religious and economic statistics as well

The earliest atlases were not called by that name at the time of their publication The first book that could be called an atlas was constructed from the calculations of Claudius Ptolemy a geographer who worked in Alexandria circa AD 150 The first edition was published in Bologna in 1477 and was illustrated with a set of 27 maps though scholars say that it is not known whether the printed maps were engraved versions of original maps made by Ptolemy or whether they were constructed by medieval Greek scholars from Ptolemys text

From about 1544 many maps were produced especially in the important trading centers of Rome and Venice Each publisher worked independently They produced maps based upon their own needs The maps often varied dramatically in size Over time it became common to bind the maps together into one book Although the term atlas was not in use in 1544 these works are now called IATO atlases  or more frequently Lafreri atlases after one of the leading publishers of the period 

With the coming of the global market publishers in different countries can reprint maps from plates made elsewhere This means that the place names on the maps often use the designations or abbreviations of the language of the country in which the feature is located to serve the widest market For example islands near Russia have the abbreviation O for ostrov not I for island This practise differs from what is standard for any given language

Some cartographically or commercially important atlases include the following

Simplified English is a set of approved words and writing rules Its makers made it to help engineers write manuals so that people all over the world can read them 

Some people think that

The rules say to only use the words in simplified English in approved ways This decreases misunderstanding For example the rules approve the use of the verb close The rules approve the use of the adjective closed meaning not open The adjective close means near The rules disapprove the use of the adjective close The rules approve the use of the adjective near for this meaning The rules specify the use of the adjective near instead of the adjective close This way the reader can be sure if the instructions say to keep the door open or to stay far from the door

People started developing simplified English in the 1970s People continue developing simplified English today AECMA is the European Association of Aerospace Manufacturers AECMA began work on simplified English ASD is the AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe ASD has a Maintenance Group called STEMG that continues work on simplified English STEMG is the Simplified Technical English Maintenance Group STEMG maintains the ASD STE100 the latest simplified English

Thymine also known as 5 methyluracil is a chemical found in the nucleic acid DNA DNA holds the genetic code for living cells

In RNA thymine is swapped with uracil to represent the same genetic information In DNA thymine connects to adenine by two hydrogen bonds These bonds hold the two strands of the DNA double helix structure together

Probability distribution is a term from mathematics Suppose there are many events with random outcomes A probability distribution is the theoretical counterpart to the frequency distribution A frequency distribution simply shows how many times a certain event occurred A probability distribution says how many times it should have occurred

There are different probability distributions Each of them has its use its benefits and its drawbacks

Common ones are

The exponential distribution is a probability distribution It is only used on the positive real numbers Its main use is to assess the duration of random time intervals Examples where it can be used

The binomial distribution is a probability distribution It has discrete values It counts the number of successes in yesno type experiments There are two parameters the number of times an experiment is done and the probability of a success Examples are

The Poisson distribution is a probability distribution It is named after Simon Denis Poisson who discovered it in 1838 It measures the probability that a certain number of events occur within a certain period of time The events need to be unrelated to each other They also need to occur with a known average rate 

Examples of this distribution are

Saman is a Dominican province It is in the northeastern part of the country It takes up the whole Saman Peninsula Its capital city is Santa Brbara de Saman usually called just Saman It is one of the main tourist regions of the country with several important resorts

It was created as a Maritime District on June 4 1867 The 1907 Dominican Constitution changed its status to province

To the north and east of the peninsula is the coast of the Atlantic Ocean To the south is the Saman Bay Saman shares borders with the Duarte and Mara Trinidad Snchez provinces It also shares a short border with Monte Plata

The word Saman written as Xaman centuries ago is the Tano name of the region The meaning of the word is unknown

Saman was visited by Christopher Columbus in January 1493 during his first travel to the Americas At that moment Saman was occupied by Ciguayos a tribe of Native Americans with the same culture of the Tanos but a different language They were the first Indians that fought against the Europeans

After the conquest of the Hispaniola island by the Spaniards Saman was occupied by different groups of Europeans mainly French people Some groups of maroon lived in the mountains for many years

To fight against those European groups Spain brought galleys and founded in 1756 the town of Santa Brbara de Saman on the northern coast of Saman Bay with people from the Canary Islands

When the eastern part of the Hispaniola was given to France in 1795 the French government tried to develop the region and many French families moved to Saman to grow coffee many places in Saman have French names Those French families left Saman when Spain took again the colony in 1809

During the Haitian Occupation a fort was built in Los Cacaos to control the Saman Bay another small fort was built in El Limn on the northern coast

Jean Pierre Boyer President of Haiti sent some Haitian families to live in Tessn to the north of Santa Brbara de Saman Boyer brought ex slaves from Philadelphia to live in the country and 200 of them were taken to live in Saman Both the Haitian and the American populations kept their languages and traditions

After the Independence several Dominican governments tried to sell or rent the Saman Bay with the peninsula to several foreign governments but without any result

In 1888 the railway from Snchez to La Vega began to run across the rich region of the Cibao Snchez became the most important port of the country during the rest of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century The railroad worked until 1966

Saman has a total area of 85374 km It has 18 of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 26th largest province

There are three municipalities and three municipal districts in the province

The municipalities and their municipal districts are

In 2002 there were 91875 people living in the Saman province and just 29046 living in towns and cities The population density was 1076 personskm

A mountain chain called Sierra de Saman runs across the province from west to east only in the western part west of Snchez there is flat land because it is an estuary The Sierra de Saman gets to the coast except in some places where there are very good beaches The highest mountain in the province is in the eastern part of the peninsula and is called La Meseta

There are many rivers and creeks but all are very short because the mountains get very close to the coast There are more rivers on the southern part of the province but the most important are on the northern part going to the Atlantic Ocean

In the southwestern part of the province is the River Yuna one of the most important river of the country it flows into the Saman Bay

Saman has a wet tropical weather with temperature of 259 degrees Celsius on average The annual rainfall on the Sierra de Saman is above 2000 mm

The most important economic activity of the province is agriculture Saman is the biggest producer of coconut in the country but the demand for that product is diminishing Cacao and rice are produced in the western part of the province

Even if fishing was a very important activity its importance has been reduced because the Yuna River has been filling the Saman Bay with solid material

Tourism is very important in the province because of the beautiful beaches in the province Whale watching is an important economic activity because many tourists come the province to watch the humpback whales that come in late winter and early spring to breed in the warm waters of the Saman Bay

Natural selection is a central concept of evolution sometimes called the survival of the fittest It was an idea of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace Darwin chose the name as an analogy with artificial selection 

Natural selection is the process where organisms with favourable traits are more likely to reproduce In doing so they pass on these traits to the next generation Over time this process allows organisms to adapt to their environment This is because the frequency of genes for favourable traits increases in the population 

Members of a species are not all alike partly because of differences in heredity This is true even with children of the same parents Some of these differences might make one organism better at surviving and reproducing than others in a particular habitat When this organism reproduces it passes along the genes which gave it the advantage to its children Some adaptations are extremely long lasting useful in many habitats The evolution of wings in birds is an example Others are good only as long as the environment stays the same If the environment changes enough then another organism might do better

Natural selection explains why living organisms change over time to have the anatomy the functions and behaviour that they have It works like this

There are now quite a number of examples of natural selection in natural populations 

A well known example of natural selection in action is the development of antibiotic resistance in microorganisms Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Alexander Fleming antibiotics have been used to fight bacterial diseases Natural populations of bacteria contain among their vast numbers of individual members considerable variation in their genetic material as the result of mutations When exposed to antibiotics most bacteria die quickly but some may have mutations that make them slightly less susceptible If the exposure to antibiotics is short these individuals will survive the treatment This selective elimination of maladapted individuals from a population is natural selection 

Given enough time and repeated exposure to the antibiotic a population of antibiotic resistant bacteria will emerge This leads to what is known as an evolutionary arms race or co evolution in which bacteria continue to develop strains that are less susceptible to antibiotics while medical researchers continue to develop new antibiotics that can kill them Response strategies typically include the use of different stronger antibiotics however new strains of MRSA have recently emerged that are resistant even to these drugs A similar situation occurs with pesticide resistance in plants and insects and with malarial resistance to quinine 

Some day flying moths were light in colour and some of the moths were dark At first the light coloured moths survived better because they were camouflaged against the white colour of the nearby trees This made it hard for birds to see them When factories were built it caused pollution that made all the trees look black Now the light coloured moths were obvious against the dark bark The dark coloured moths now had the advantage after the environment changed The genes controlling dark colour spread through the population of moths

Another example Some harmless insects mimic other insects which are dangerous or which taste foul Mimicry evolves because the better mimics survive better They live to produce more offspring than the less good mimics The genes of the better mimics become more common in the species Over time mimic species get closer to their models This is the process of evolution by natural selection

Sexual selection is a special kind of natural selection It is a theory of Charles Darwin that certain evolutionary traits can be explained by competition within a species Darwin defined sexual selection as the effects of the struggle between the individuals of one sex generally the males for the possession of the other sex It is usually males who fight each other Traits selected by male combat are called secondary sexual characteristics and sometimes referred to as weapons Traits selected by mate choice are called ornaments

Females often prefer to mate with males with external ornamentsexaggerated features of morphology Genes that enable males to develop impressive ornaments or fighting ability may simply show off greater disease resistance or a more efficient metabolismfeatures that also benefit females This idea is known as the good genes hypothesis Sexual selection is still being researched and discussed today

The UCI ProTour is the series of races for the top cycling teams The Continental circuits are for teams that are not so good

Some teams such as Team Milram have one team on the ProTour a team of younger riders on the continental circuit as well as being linked with U23 teams In this way teams can spot talented riders

There are five circuits one each for

Usually organisers of a ProTour event can invite one or two teams from the continental circuit to compete Also a ProTour team might decide to compete in a continental circuit race

The word fiddle means a violin when used in folk music Many people also use it simply as a fun word for violin Someone who plays the fiddle is a fiddler The bow is sometimes called a fiddling stick Fiddle playing or fiddling is a style of folk music

The word fiddle is also used for instruments of several hundred years ago which developed into the violin These instruments varied a lot from one country to another and one time to another They were of different shapes and sizes and even had many different names Often they were held against the chest instead of being tucked under the chin In the middle ages a small narrow violin called a kit was often used by dancing masters It was small enough to be put in a pocket In south eastern Europe there was even a fiddle with a belly made of skin Fiddle strings were usually made of gut

Many fiddles have bridges which are flatter on top than those of classical violins The flatter bridges makes it easier to play chords and to bow quickly from one string to another The strings are tuned in a variety of ways A player might even change the tuning for playing different pieces of music Tunings other than the regular G D A E tuning such as G D G D or A E A E are common One two or three of the strings may have been used for a drone while playing the tune on the top string

Many fiddlers have not received classical training but have learned by listening to other fiddlers and copying them The music they play is dance music Classical violin playing developed out of country fiddle playing Most fiddlers use bows which are the same as violin bows but in some countries such as Hungary they use shorter heavier bows with horse hair that is tied around the frog With this type of bow the player tightens the hair by squeezing it while playing

Fiddles were played by people from all areas of society from noble people to simple peasants Many of them were minstrels who entertained important people Some of them may have been able to read music but many would have learned by copying other players and memorizing the music At important feasts the minstrels may have played music while walking up to the high table when the food was brought in They played to accompany dancers and singers and even acrobats We can see from old paintings that they sometimes played with other instruments such as trumpets drums or percussion We do not know the music they played because it was never written down but some tunes we still hear today may have come from those old tunes since some people still learn tunes by ear from people who learned them by ear and so on Some American old time tunes and some Breton tunes may have come to us in this way for example 

A Hardanger fiddle or hardingfele in Norwegian is a traditional string instrument used mainly in the south west of Norway It is similar to the violin but it has eight or nine strings and the wood is thinner Four of the strings are strung and played like a violin while the other strings are sympathetic strings 

The Hardingfele is used for dancing The player stamps his foot loudly while playing It was the Norwegian tradition for a bridal procession to be led to the church by a Hardanger fiddler

The instrument has a lot of decoration with a carved animal or a carved womans head as part of the scroll at the top of the pegbox mother of pearl in the tailpiece and fingerboard and black ink decorations called rosing on the body of the instrument Sometimes pieces of bone are used to decorate the pegs and the edges of the instrument

The earliest known instrument is dated 1651 although we do not know whether this date is correct By 1850 it had developed into the Hardanger fiddle known today 

The Hardanger fiddle can be tuned in lot of different ways depending on the music to be played The Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg liked Norwegian folk music When he wrote the famous tune Morning for the music for Peer Gynt he was thinking of the notes that would be played on the Hardanger fiddle

In the 20th century the Hardanger fiddle has become very popular in Norway through competitions The players have to play in the style of the area they come from

Auguste Rodin was a French sculptor He made solid objects from stone or clay His most famous works are The Thinker and The Kiss

Although Rodin is generally considered the start of modern sculpture he did not set out to rebel against the past His training was old school He took a craftsman like approach to his work but he was never accepted into Pariss foremost school of art

Rodin had a unique ability to model a complex turbulent deeply pocketed surface in clay Many of his most notable sculptures were roundly criticized during his lifetime They clashed with the sculpture tradition in which works were decorative formulaic or highly thematic 

Rodins most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and allegory He modelled the human body with realism with individual character and physicality Rodin refused to change his style Gradually there came increasing favour from the government and the artistic community

His statue of writer Honor de Balzac for the Socit des Gens des Lettres was heavily criticised Rather than try to convince skeptics of its merit Rodin repaid the Socit his commission and moved the figure to his own garden After this experience Rodin did not complete another public commission Only in 1939 was Monument to Balzac cast in bronze It is now thought to be a masterpiece

Rodins reputation grew and he became the top French sculptor of his time By 1900 he was a world renowned artist Wealthy private clients sought Rodins work after his 1900 Worlds Fair exhibit He kept company with a variety of high profile intellectuals and artists He married his life long companion Rose Beuret in the last year of both their lives His sculpture suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917 but within a few decades his legacy solidified Rodin remains one of the few sculptors widely known to the public

The rebec is a bowed string musical instrument that was played many hundreds of years ago It was either held under the chin like a violin or held against the arm The name rebec was spelt in a variety of ways

The rebec dates back to the Middle Ages and was particularly popular in the 15th and 16th centuries The instrument is European but probably developed from the Afghan instrument called the rebab Instruments like the rebec were being played in the 10th century

The rebec can have any number of strings from one to five although three is the most common number The strings are often tuned in fifths The instrument played high notes like the violin but in later years bigger rebecs were made that played lower notes

The rebec was mostly used for dance music Dancing masters often used a kind of pocket sized rebec called a kit

The rebec was also used in folk music especially in eastern Europe Spain and North Africa

In medieval and Renaissance times the rebec in Europe was played by minstrels They dressed in special livery and played at important feasts and in processions They were also played by cowherds King Henry VIII has several rebec players at his court

Today many Middle Ages re enactors like to play rebec since it is an authentic Medieval instrument

A resonator is something that makes a sound bigger The sound resonates

In electromagnetics a cavity resonator is a resonator composed of a space that is usually surrounded by a dielectric or metal which allows standing wave patterns at particular frequencies eigenmodes correlated to their size shape and material

Most musical instruments have resonators They are the parts which makes the sound louder A vibraphone for example has long tubes underneath the keys It also has a special effect a mechanism which when it is turned on opens and shuts the resonators very quickly so that a trembling sound is heard

The body of a violin is a resonator without the body the sound of the string vibrating would hardly be heard just as the sound of an elastic band stretched between two fingers can hardly be heard

Joshua David Bell is an American violinist He is considered one of the greatest violinists of today

Bell was born in Bloomington Indiana United States His father was a psychologist and therapist He began violin lessons at the age of four after his mother found that her son had taken rubber bands from around the house and stretched them across the handles of his dresser drawer to pluck out music he had heard her play on the piano His parents got him a very small violin and started giving him lessons He learned the violin very quickly but also had time to enjoy things such as video games and sports 

Bells first violin teacher suggested that he should learn with Josef Gingold Bell says that Gingold was a great teacher At the age of fourteen Bell appeared as a soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Riccardo Muti He studied the violin at the Indiana Universitys Jacobs School of Music while managing to graduate from Bloomington High School North in 1984

An elastic modulus or modulus of elasticity is the mathematical description of an object or substances tendency to be deformed elastically when a force is applied to it 

where is the elastic modulus stress is the force that causes the deformation divided by the area to which the force is applied and strain is the ratio of the change caused by the stress to the original state of the object 

If one specifies how stress and strain are to be measured that allows for many types of elastic moduli to be defined

 ISO 3166 1 is part of the ISO 3166 standardIt gives a code for the names of countries and dependent territories and is published by the International Organization for Standardization The official name of the standard is Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions Part 1 Country codes There are three sets of country codes

ISO 3166 1 is not the only standard for country codes Many international organizations use their own country codes where some of them closely correspond to the ISO 3166 1 codes For examples see country codes

Currently 244 countries and territories have official ISO 3166 1 codes The only way to enter a new country name into ISO 3166 1 is to have it registered in one of the following two sources

To be listed in the bulletin Country Names a country or territory must be any of the following

Once a country name or territory name appears in either of these two sources it will be added to ISO 3166 1 by default

The following is a complete ISO 3166 1 encoding code list in alphabetical order by the English short country names officially used by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency which uses country names from United Nations sources The table includes officially assigned codes only

Besides the officially assigned codes code elements may be expanded by using either reserved codes or user assigned codes

Reserved code elements are codes which while not ISO 3166 1 codes are in use for some applications in conjunction with the ISO 3166 codes They are reserved to add flexibility to the coding system Usually obsolete codes may be kept as reserved while some overseas territories international organizations and special nationality status have reserved codes of their own See the corresponding sections in ISO 3166 1 alpha 2 and ISO 3166 1 alpha 3 for their respective reserved codes

User assigned code elements are codes at the disposal of users who need to add further names of countries territories or other geographical entities to their in house application of ISO 3166 1 and the ISO 3166MA will never use them in the updating process of the standard See the corresponding sections in ISO 3166 1 alpha 2 ISO 3166 1 alpha 3 and ISO 3166 1 numeric for their respective user assigned codes

A country or territory may get new codes if it changes its name or its territorial boundaries A country generally gets new alphabetical codes if its name changes whereas a new numeric code is associated with a change of boundaries Changes to ISO 3166 1 are announced in periodic newsletters of which 12 have been released since the first edition of ISO 3166 1 was published in 1997

The second edition of ISO 3166 1 was published in 2007 which comprises a consolidation of all changes to the lists as published in the newsletters above

The lira da braccio was a European string instrument that was played with a bow It was used during the Renaissance Italian poet musicians in court in the 15th and 16th centuries often played it to accompany the poems they were reading The lira da braccio was very similar to the medieval fiddle Changes continued to be made to the way the lira da braccio was made until the end of the 16th century In paintings it is often seen being played by the gods Orpheus and Apollo Sometimes it was used in groups of instruments

The instrument was a similar shape to a violin but with a wider fingerboard and flatter bridge It usually had seven strings five of them tuned like a violin with a low D added to the bottom and two other strings for drones It is likely that the player often played the tune on the top strings and chords on the lower strings

The lira da braccio was very popular at court Later in the 16th century the madrigal became very popular and also the violin so the lira da braccio was used less It continued to be used in plays especially when it was associated with Apollo By the middle of the 17th century people no longer played it

Atlas was a missile built by the Convair Division of General Dynamics 

It was originally designed as an ICBM in the late 1950s Then it became the foundation for a family of successful space launch vehicles now built by United Launch Alliance The Atlas rocket family is today used as a launch platform for commercial and military satellites and other space vehicles

The Atlas first tested in 1957 was the United States first successful ICBM 

Atlas named for the Atlas of Greek mythology got its start in 1946 with the award of an Army Air Forces research contract to Convair for the study of a 1500 to 5000 mi range nuclear armed missile 

The missile was originally given the military designation XB 65 thus making it a bomber from 1955 it was redesignated SM 65 and from 1962 it became CGM 16 This letter C stood for coffin or Container because the rocket was stored in a semi hardened container it was prepared for launch by being raised and fueled in the open The Atlas F was stored vertically underground but launched after being lifted to the surface 

The Dominican Constitution says that the flag of the Dominican Republic has a white cross in the centre the arms of the cross get to the sides of the flag and divides the flag into four rectangles the left rectangles are blue and red and the right ones are red and blue The width of the white cross is half the height of one of the rectangles

The National Flag like the state and war flags of other Latin American countries has a small coat of arms in the centre of the white cross but there is not a coat of arms in the ensign

The Dominican flag was created the first day of Independence it was created from the Haitian flag but with a white cross that is two blue rectangles on the top and two red rectangles on the bottom The colors are from the French flag That was the First National Flag

The first Dominican Constitution of 6 November 1844 did not say anything about the distribution of the rectangles but from the start the flag was represented with alternation of the colors this is the Second National Flag Only the Constitution of 1908 is specific about the color distribution

The states and territories of Australia make up the Commonwealth of Australia under a federal system of government

From 1926 to 1931 Central Australia existed as a separate territory between the 20th and 26th parallels of latitude before being becoming a part of the Northern Territory again

 Background and overview  The states started as separate British colonies before Federation Their powers are protected by the Australian constitution The territories are under the control of the Commonwealth government The Australian Parliament has powers to create laws in the territories that it does not have in the states

Most of the territories are directly administered by the Commonwealth government Three of the territories administer themselves In the territories that govern themselves the Australian Parliament has the power to govern and can override laws made by the territorial governments It has done this at times but it is rare that it happens The Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory are usually treated as states

Each state has a governor This governor is chosen by the Queen but she chooses the person on the advice of the state Premier The Administrators of the Northern Territory and of Norfolk Island are chosen by the Governor General The Australian Capital Territory is governed by the Governor General

The head of government of each state is called the Premier This person is chosen by the states Governor Normally the Governor will select as Premier whoever leads the lower house of the state Parliament However the Governor can chose someone else as Premier The head of government of the self governing mainland territories is called the Chief Minister The Northern Territorys Chief Minister is normally whoever controls the Legislative Assembly is appointed by the Administrator

The body mass index is a measure which shows whether people have the right weight for their height The World Health Organisation governments and health workers use it It is also called the Quetelet Index

The BMI was invented by Adolphe Quetelet between 1830 and 1850 BMI is still sometimes called the Quetelet Index

A scientist called Ancel Keys first used the name body mass index in 1972 He wrote that governments should measure peoples BMI to find out whether their people are too fat or too thin

To find somebodys BMI

Health organisations including the World Health Organisation use the BMI to help decide whether people are too fat or too thin The WHO uses these numbers for adults

Some people disagree with these numbers Some experts think the Overweight range for people with Asian body types should be 23 2749 not 25 2999 Some experts think the lowest Normal BMI should be 20 for men and 18 for women

BMI is useful for governments who want to know about the health of their people For example in the United States in 2007 74 of adults had a BMI above 25 and 27 of adults had a BMI above 30 Many of these people will become ill because they are too fat This information helps the United States government decide what to do about the health of its people

BMI is less useful for finding out whether one person is too fat or too thin BMI does not say how much weight is fat how much is muscle and how much is bone For example many athletes have a high BMI They are not fat Their BMI is high because they have lots of heavy muscle Other people have lots of fat and not much muscle They are too fat but their BMI is normal

Even so BMI is popular It is easy to use and easy to understand and it gives useful information for people with normal bodies

Middle aged people begin to look older with more wrinkles in their skin and start to have grey hair They become less fit less strong and usually gain more weight 

Middle aged females find it harder to become pregnant If they do have a baby there is a higher chance that it will have a genetic disease Females usually have their menopause in middle age when they stop menstruating every month When that happens they cannot have children anymore

Tropical Depression Ten was a short lived tropical cyclone that moved onto land on western Florida in September 2007 It was the tenth tropical cyclone of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season The storm formed as a subtropical depression on September 21 in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico from the contact of a tropical wave the end of a cold front and a low pressure system Originally the system had a disorganized circulation and thunderstorm patterns but later turned into a tropical depression after convection became more organized over the center Moving northwestward the depression came onto land near Fort Walton Beach early on September 22 and shortly later it dissipated over southeastern Alabama The depression caused only light damages to the area and was limited to light rainfall although the system that would later become Tropical Depression 10 created a damaging tornado in Eustis Florida

By September 17 the contact between a tropical wave and the end of a cold front created huge amounts of thunderstorms over the Bahamas and western Atlantic Ocean An upper level low over western Florida created more convection across the area and on September 18 the system began moving towards Florida Originally the system was very disorganized but surface pressures slowly went down across the area with a weak low pressure area forming on September 19 A Hurricane Hunters aircraft was sent to fly into the system on September 20 reported an organized low and strong wind gusts in the storm as it moved into the northeastern Gulf of Mexico along with little and disorganized thunderstorm activity Convection slowly became better organized with a well defined rainband in its eastern half and irregular thunderstorm activity near the center In spite of its bad organization with a disorganized circulation and an upper level low aloft the National Hurricane Center started advisories on Subtropical Depression Ten at 1500 UTC on September 21 while it was located about 40 miles south of St Vincent Island Florida stating the potential for additional development right along the coastline

With a mid level ridge to its northwest the subtropical depression was predicted to move alongside with the coastline of Florida and Alabama As a outcome the cyclone was forecasted to have winds of 45 mph and move onto land on southern Mississippi The circulation became better organized as convection modestly increased over the center and within 6 hours of its formation the system turned into a tropical depression The cyclone continued moving northwestward making landfall around 0000 UTC on September 22 near Fort Walton Beach Florida with winds of 35 mph The cloud pattern began to become disorganized as it moved inland and 3 hours after it moved ashore the National Hurricane Center gave out its last advisory on the depression As the depression continued into Alabama it became more disorganized and by 0900 UTC on September 22 the cyclone collapsed into a remnant low pressure area

At the same time the National Hurricane Center gave out its first advisory on the depression they also gave out a tropical storm warning from Apalachicola Florida to the delta of the Mississippi River Shortly thereafter an inland tropical storm warning was given out for Pearl River Walthall and Pike counties in Mississippi and Washington Parish in Louisiana Also the New Orleans National Weather Service gave out a coastal flood watch for four parishes in southeastern Louisiana In Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour declared a state of emergency Officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for people living in areas of low lands and in mobile homes for Jackson Harrison and Hancock counties Officials in New Orleans opened three emergency shelters stating the possible need of shelter for citizens in about 17000 FEMA trailers after Hurricane Katrina Because of the threat of the cyclone Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco also declared a state of emergency and placed the states National Guard and other disaster services on stand by

Before of the depressions development several oil and gas companies removed unneeded workers from offshore oil platforms in the northern Gulf of Mexico the Shell Oil Company evacuated about 700 employees while Noble Energy removed its workforce of about 300 people from two oil rigs Exxon Mobil stopped its production by about 1000 barrels of oil and 55000 ft With 277 of the daily crude oil production stopped because of the depression oil prices rose higher after days of increasing levels and on September 20 reached a record rate of over 84 per barrel

Together the wind shear and low level helicity created moderate convection across central Florida associated with the precursor low pressure system Late on September 20 a supercell formed near Lake Apopka and moved quickly northward it created an EF1 tornado near Eustis the tornado moved around for about 2 miles and reached winds of about 100 mph The tornado destroyed 20 homes left 30 others severely damaged and injured one person and cut power for about 300 people The depression also created waves of about 5 feet and rip currents along the west coast of Florida Outer rainbands began affecting coastal sections of western Florida by about 12 hours before the formation of the depression Precipitation in the state reached 283 inches in Crestview In other places rainfall totals reached 146 inches in Albany Georgia and 051 inches in Dothan Alabama

Copyright infringement of software refers to the illegal copying of software music or films or the spread of these things on the Internet Copying films is also called bootlegging Some countries have laws about this The problem is considered to be bigger in certain countries than in others Those who hold the copyright get less money because of copyright infringement As a result of this some copyright holders publish anti piracy campaigns to tell people about the effects of infringement

Very often the people making the laws have to make a trade off between allowing people to copy and use the content and the copyright holders charging for the content At the same time even not allowed distribution makes the content more popular Because of these two reasons infringement of copyright for proprietary software and content can be bad also for free software and content

In 2010 to 2012 the entertainment industry advocated changes to the law to make it easier to end piracy websites called Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect IP Act Some websites protested these proposals on January 18 2012 The next day the United States Department of Justice siezed the Megaupload website which is claimed to be one of the largest piracy websites

Bionicle is a line of toys by the LEGO Group marketed primarily for 5 to 16 year olds The line was launched on December 30 2000 in Europe and JuneJuly 2001 in Canada and the United States Bionicle is a portmanteau constructed from the words biological and chronicle The concept is similar to Lego Groups earlier themes SlizersThrowbots and RoboRiders in that each of those lines had characters based on classical elements Earlier Bionicle packages had displayed the Technic Logo but it has since been phased out evolving Bionicle into its own branch of LEGO It has recently been announced by the director of LEGO that they will stop making new Bionicle sets after Winter 2010 for the foreseeable future However while production of sets will stop the story will not as Greg Farshtey will continue to update it on the website Bionicle was replaced by Hero Factory which was released later in July 2010

The Bionicle story is set in a science fantasy world and is primarily told through the book series Bionicle Chronicles Bionicle Adventures and Bionicle Legends as well as through comic books published by DC Comics Four films have also been made As of 2010 the main Bionicle story will be published online

The 20012008 Bionicle story arc was set in a world inhabited predominantly by part organic part machine beings in a subterranean world which exists in massive domes underground 2009 began a new saga of the story line leaving behind the previous years and venturing out to newer possibilities as Mata Nui after having been banished by Makuta Teridax finds his way to a mysterious barren planet called Bara Magna Here he becomes the center of the story and makes new allies as he tries to find a way to save the Matoran from Makuta Teridaxs tyrannical rule

The concept of Bionicle was proposed in 2000 During that time Lego was suffering a ten year downturn In 1998 the company suffered its first loss resulting layoffs for the first time with 1000 people being laid off the following year In January 2004 Lego posted a loss of 14 billion Danish kroner A few weeks earlier in order to stabilise its financial situation another 500 jobs were cut

Initially the idea of Bionicle was faced with resistance from company traditionalists as Lego had no experience of creating the kind of story based multichannel brand that was being proposed Also the war like appearance of the Bionicle characters went against the companys values high quality products an emphasis on free play and encouraging the imagination and no modern warfare or violence

However the Bionicle line soon became the biggest of the recent hits and the number one product of Lego in 2003 The series made its first debut in virtual form on the web in December 2000 In 2004 the sets accounted for approximately all of Legos turnover As the sets were produced Lego developed them on the sets website through character bios and an episodic adventure game The main storyline is developed by a team of eight people around the world who decide which media gets which bit of the story Because the Bionicle story is told through multiple media the purpose of the website is to put the different parts together The practice of making every Bionicle product from toys to toothbrushes promote the website resulted in web traffic averaging more than a million page views per month in August 2004 Another strategy used to promote the website was the use of Kanoka points Each toy packaging had special access codes that allows users to earn the points that can be used to play web games

The 20012008 storyline arc of Bionicle was set in a science fantasy world inhabited predominantly by part organic part machine beings in a subterranean world which exists in massive domes underground This world and its races were once protected by a Great Spirit named Mata Nui until he was cast into an eternal slumber by the evil Makuta Teridax and the Brotherhood of Makuta The world of the Matoran began to fall apart But mask of life that was stored inside Mata Nui was sent out to space to find a new planet The mask landed on the planet of Bara Magna and the mask created a small body

2009 began a whole new saga of the story line leaving behind the previous years and venturing out to newer possibilities as Mata Nui after having been banished by Makuta Teridax crash lands on a mysterious barren planet called Bara Magna Here he becomes the center of the story and makes new allies as he tries to find a way to save the Matoran and the Toa from Makuta Teridaxs tyrannical rule

The story begins with six Toa Mata Tahu Lewa Gali Kopaka Pohatu and Onua arriving on an island known as the Island of Mata Nui remembering nothing beyond their names They discovered that the inhabitants the Matoran villagers face constant attacks from infected Rahi savage beasts controlled by the powerful influence of Makuta Teridax through use of Infected Kanohi masks causing a war which lasted about 1000 years After searching for and finding numerous Kanohi masks the Toa each receive a Golden Kanohi mask with tremendous power and seek out Makuta himself After challenging the ferocious Manas crabs and the Shadow Toa the Toa confront Makuta and defeat him by uniting their elemental powers

Upon his defeat Makuta released the ancient Bohrok Bohrok are robotic drones that were designed to cleanse the island of Mata Nui to its state in the before time The Bohrok began to tear through the villages on the island forcing Matoran to flee One inventive Matoran of Earth Nuparu builds a powerful vehicle called the Boxor made from parts of a damaged Bohrok in order to fight off the swarms The Toa unaware of the Bohroks purpose collected the Bohroks Krana to confront the Bohrok Queens the Bahrag Cahdok and Gahdok The defeated Cahdok and Gahdok are sealed in a prison created by the Toas elemental powers The Toa Mata are then exposed to a substance called Energized Protodermis which transforms them granting them new armor and weapons They renamed themselves the Toa Nuva

With Cahdok and Gahdok defeated the Bohrok Swarms are stopped and returned to their hives However six new elite Bohrok called the Bohrok Kal appeared with the purpose of releasing the Bahrag They then proceeded to steal the Toa Nuvas powers which are the key to breaking the seal On the verge of defeat the Toa force all of their powers into the Bohrok Kal overloading and defeating them 

Shortly afterwards two Matoran Takua and Jaller discovered the Kanohi Mask of Light They were tasked with traveling across the island of Mata Nui to find the Toa of Light Meanwhile Makuta created and sent out six creatures called Rahkshi to find the mask and stop the coming of the Toa of Light The Rahkshi tore across Mata Nui destroying the villages of Ta Koro and Onu Koro The Rahkshi were stopped by the Toa but not before killing Jaller Jallers death caused Takua to realize he was the Toa of Light and he donned the mask to become Toa Takanuva Takanuva went to confront Makuta and during their battle they both fell into a pool of energized protodermis a silvery substance with the power to change or destroy a being and became fused together into the being Takutanuva Takutanuva then proceeded to open the door to the city of Metru Nui allowing the Matoran and Toa through Using some of his life energy he revived Jaller while still holding the door open However the use of energy was too great and Takutanuva was crushed by the door seeming to kill both Takanuva and Teridax leaving only Takanuvas Mask of Light Takanuva was promptly revived when his mask was used to activate the beacon to Metru Nui Afterwards the Matoran prepared to return to the island city of Metru Nui

As the Matoran prepared to journey to Metru Nui the Turaga revealed that they had once been Toa fighting in Metru Nui against threats such as the Morbuzakh plant creature and the Dume controlled Vahki enforcement squads They as Matoran were transformed into the Toa Metru by Toa stones containing power sacrificed by Toa Lhikan Their mission was to find the six Great Disks and defeat the Morbuzakh a plant menace that threatened to destroy the city When they did however they were betrayed by Dume the Turaga of the city Later they discovered that Makuta Teridax had taken the disguise of Dume and taken control of the Vahki His plan was to put the Matoran to sleep wipe out their memories and reawaken them as their conqueror The Toa fled but were attacked by Teridax Combining their elemental powers they were able to seal Teridax in a prison of crystallized protodermis The Toa traveled to a new island which would later be known as Mata Nui vowing to return to save the Matoran

They do return however the evil king Sidorak and his viceroy Roodaka had been reigning in terror on the island with vicious spider like creatures called Visorak The Toa were soon captured and mutated into bestial Toa Hordika To revert back to normal the Toa sought out the legendary Rahi Keetongu Toa Vakama however betrayed the other Toa and joined Sidorak who made him the leader of the Visorak The other Toa confronted the Visorak horde in a great battle and convinced Vakama to rejoin them Vakama then ordered the Visorak to be free Keetongu then killed Sidorak whom Roodaka and Vakama betrayed The six Toa then defeated Roodaka with all six of their elemental powers However this had the side effect of freeing Makuta because Roodaka carried a fragment of his prison The Toa struck her for this reason Having been restored by Keetongu the Toa Metru brought the Matoran to a new island When they sacrificed their power to awaken the Matoran they become Turaga and later established new villages on this island called Mata Nui

The Toa Nuva learned that Mata Nui was not only asleep but dying To save him they must travel to the island of Voya Nui and seek the mysterious Kanohi Ignika the Mask of Life The Toa Nuva set out on this adventure but are quickly taken prisoner by six new and powerful enemies the Piraka Zaktann Hakann Vezok Thok Reidak and Avak They sought the mask for their own dark purposes When the Toa failed to return a group of six Matoran followed after them Jaller Hahli Hewkii Nuparu Kongu and Matoro escaped to the island in Toa canisters but as they traveled bolts of lighting from the Red Star transformed them into the Toa Inika Upon their arrival they learn of the Piraka and how they enslaved the local Matoran by posing as false Toa in order to make the Matoran build them a fortress With the help of a small Matoran Resistance and the ancient guardian Axonn the Toa Inika were able to free the Toa Nuva find the temple of the mask and battle the Piraka as well as the other creatures guarding it They eventually emerged victorious with the Kanohi But the Mask of Life possessed a will of its own and in the last moment evades them all rushing into the depths of the sea

Following the chase for the Mask of Life the Toa Inika descended into the waters after receiving the mysterious clue save the sunken city from an unknown Matoran who had saved Hahli from drowning at the cost of him dying from decompression sickness14 A burst of energy from the Mask of Life transformed the Toa Inika into water breathing forms They discovered an inhabited village of Mahri Nui that had broken off from Voya Nui and sunk a thousand years ago The village was threatened by ancient warlords known as Barraki that had been mutated by the nearby mutagenic waters called The Pit The Toa now known as Toa Mahri faced off against the Barraki to survive However by the time the Toa retrieved the mask the Great Spirit died Realizing there was still hope Toa Matoro rushed to the core of the universe and sacrificed his life to revive Mata Nui In the last moments of his life Toa Matoro used the Masks power to teleport the Toa Mahri back to Metru Nui and allow them to breathe air again The Great Spirits life was saved but he still had to be awakened

After being equipped with new armor and weapons by Artakha the Toa Nuva arrived at Karda Nui the core of the universe There they came to face the Makuta who were trying to turn the population of Av Matoran Matoran of Light into Shadow Matoran The Toa Nuva were helped by the arrival of Takanuva now able to control Light and Shadow because of a shadow leech attack and Toa Ignika who is the Mask of Life itself The Kanohi Ignika had made a body for itself because it wished to see what it was like to be a living being With their combined forces they reached a structure in the center of Karda Nui called the Codrex where Toa Ignika had to sacrifice his new body to awaken Mata Nui Takanuva with the help of the remaining uncorrupted Av Matoran returned the Shadow Matoran to their previous states Shortly afterwards the Toa escaped the core before the energy storm caused by Mata Nuis awakening could destroy them The Makuta however failed to escape and were all killed Back in Metru Nui Mata Nuis awakening was celebrated but celebration was cut short when it was revealed that Teridax had taken over the body of Mata Nui revealed to be the universe of the Matoran Trapping the spirit of Mata Nui in the Mask of Life he sent it flying into space so that the former Great Spirit cannot interfere with his control over the universe

The Bionicle story continues after Mata Nui was banished from his body by Makuta Teridax onto a planet called Bara Magna With the exception of a few wildlife species Bara Magna is a barren desert planet which only supports few resources so each tribe on the planet has a few warriors called Glatorian to battle for them These resources such as food and water are distributed accordingly The villagers of this world are known as Agori The Agori together make up six different tribes each affiliated with a region After the Mask of Life lands on Bara Magna it creates a body for Mata Nui to use Mata Nui then teams up with a few Glatorian to defeat the combined forces of the Skrall and Bone Hunters two major threats to the villages and look for a way to return to his body With the help of his new Glatorian and Agori friends he exposes a traitor known as Metus and defeats the Skrall and Bone Hunters He helps the villages of the world to unite taking all of the giant pieces of robot and linking them into a large prototype robotic body a body like the one the Matoran Universe resides in

After defeating the Skrall and seeing the rest of the villages unite Mata Nui stands against the challenge of taking back his old body from Teridax He learns that he was created by the Great Beings on the planet of Spherus Magna which is now divided into a jungle moon an ocean moon and the remaining desert planet as the result of the Core War Mata Nui also learns that before he was built there was a previous robot which the Agori use as their home An Agori of Tesara named Tarduk helps Mata Nui by showing him an ancient power source that could power up the old robot

In this final journey two heroes return to finish the fight Tahu returned to his original form to wear the powerful Golden Armor and Takanuva They are aided by Gresh They fight off the Skakdi Warlord Nektann to defeat Makuta and his army hordes of Rahkshi armed with heat vision and Skrall

The story continues as the forces of both the Matoran Universe and Glatorian face the oncoming onslaught of Skakdi Rahkshi and Skrall The golden armour scattered by Makutas blast is collected by Tahu Gresh and Takanuva from the many enemies Tahu defeats Skakdi warlord Nektann and then dons the armour which incinerates every Rahkshi Kraata on Bara Magna

Teridax claims that he will destroy Bara Magna with gravitic energy until Mata Nui forces his arm upwards causing Teridax to send the energy wave to the moons above Mata Nui pushes Teridax back into one of the onrushing moons the green moon of Bota Magna whose impact destroys his core processor which kills Teridax Mata Nui then mourns the brother that he could have had in his mind

The finale concludes when Mata Nui uses his strength and the power of the Mask of Life to bring Spherus Magna together once more to heal those who were mutated by Pit Mutagen to bring life back to the planet and to reconstruct destroyed geographical features The strain causes his power core to dissipate destroying the prototype robot When the Glatorian and Toa discover the Ignika unscathed in the location where Mata Nui was Mata Nui speaks to them from within the Mask of Life He tells them that the future is their own and theirs to build He then remains dormant in the Ignika The Agori Matoran Toa Glatorian and all others begin a new life on Spherus Magna

The Bionicle toyline drew to a close in late 2009 after the 2010 sets were finalized for release and was replaced in the summer of 2010 by Hero Factory a Lego theme that s compatible with Bionicle sets But despite this the story is continuing in serials written by Greg Farshtey online at BIONICLEstorycom

The Bionicle franchise has been well received with one reviewer describing the sets as good combination of assembly and action figure and first year sales of 100 million British pounds Bionicle had received a Toy of the Year Award for Most Innovative Toy in 2001 from the Toy Industry Association

In 2001 several Mori tribal groups from New Zealand threatened legal action against Lego for allegedly trademarking Mori words used in naming the Bionicle product range In response a Lego spokesperson stated that only the term Bionicle had been trademarked Lego agreed to stop commercial use of the Mori language after sending an executive to meet with Mori representatives in New Zealand Some Mori terms used by Lego were changed such as Huki which was changed to HewkiiCitation neededdateMay 2010 and Tohunga which was changed to Matoran Within the fictional Bionicle universe these changes were explained by the introduction of a Naming Day holiday in which characters who have done heroic deeds for their village are honored by having the spelling of their name changed However a number of Mori terms such as Toa which means warrior Kanohi which means face and Kopaka which means cold were not changed Since this controversy Lego has not made any more names that are common terms in other living languages

The rapid success of Bionicle has had a major impact on the Lego company According to Stephanie Lawrence the global director of licensing for Lego Weve created an evergreen franchise to complement the many event based properties on the childrens market An increasing number of category manufacturers want to tap into the power of the BIONICLE universe and the key for us now is to manage the excitement to stay true to the brand and the lifestyle of our core consumer According to one source Bionicle has changed the way children think of and play with LEGO products by combining the best of LEGO building with the story telling and adventure of an action figure line and that 85 of American boys age 612 know of the Bionicle brand and 45 own the toys

Paul Hardcastle and Simon Fuller produced the first soundtracks for Bionicles commercials used in 2001 to 2003 Music for the first three Bionicle films featured a more classical tune rather that the techno like beats used in the ads and animations In 2005 the first official Bionicle songs were released They were produced by rock band All Insane Kids and are called Hero and Caught In A Dream Further down Bionicles history more songs were used to help advertise their sets most of which were produced by Danish band Cryoshell as well as songs by other artists like Crashed by Daughtry and Move Along by The All American Rejects

In botany flora has two meanings 

The first meaning refers to all plant life in an area or time period 

The second meaning refers to a book or other work which describes the plant species in an area or time period with the aim of allowing identification 

The term flora comes from Latin language Flora the goddess of flowers in Roman mythology The corresponding term for animal life is fauna 

Plants are grouped into floras based on region period special environment or climate Regions can be geographically distinct habitats like mountain vs flatland Floras can mean plant life of an historic era as in fossil flora 

Bacterial organisms are sometimes included in a flora httpbiologyusgsgovstSNTnoframezy198htmF Other times the terms bacterial flora and plant flora are used separately

Flora is plant life as distinct from animal life or a book or other work that describes the plant species in a particular area or region

Flora may also refer to

Twin towns are towns or cities in different countries which are paired to encourage human contact and cultural links

In Europe the pairs of towns are called twin towns but other languages say friendship towns or partner towns in North America and Australasia the towns are called sister cities Brother cities was the name of twinned cities in the old Soviet bloc 

Twin towns often have similar populations industries and other characteristics Sometimes even larger areas enter into twinning agreements such as that between the provinces of Hainan in China and Jeju in South Korea

The earliest form of town twinning in Europe was between the German city of Paderborn and the French city of Le Mans in 836 although this was not officially established as a modern town twinning arrangement until 1967

Coventry United Kingdom was the first ever city to twin with another city and hence began the modern practice of twinning 

After the Second World War twinning was a way to bring European people into a closer understanding of each other and to promote cross border projects and peace 

For example Coventry twinned with Dresden as an act of peace and reconciliation both cities having been heavily bombed during the war Each twin city country is represented in a specific ward of the city and in each ward has a peace garden dedicated to that twin city 

Another early example of town twinning dates back to 1947 when Bristol Corporation sent five leading citizens on a goodwill mission to Hanover

Twinning is more popular in Europe than anywhere else but the idea has now spread to other continents

Since 1989 the European Union has had a support scheme for town twinning In 2003 an annual budget of about 12 million euros was given to about 1300 projects

The first city in North America to establish a sister city relationship was Toledo Ohio United States with Toledo Spain in 1931 In 1944 Vancouver British Columbia Canada twinned with the Ukrainian city of Odessa which at the time was part of the Soviet Union This was to show support and to help the allied port city during World War II

Genetic drift is a random effect on biological populations Its effect is to remove genetic variation from a population of living organisms

In natural populations there are a number of forces acting There are forces which add heritable variation to the population such as mutation and recombination There are also factors which remove variation from the population and drift is one of these

In a species or an interbreeding population there is usually a great deal of genetic variation This genetic variation is in the form of different alleles at many loci on the chromosomes 

Changes in allele frequency is mainly caused by natural selection that is by differential survival and contribution to the next generation But as populations get smaller there is a tendency for each generation to become more homozygous with less variety of alleles This is an effect similar to inbreeding it leads to genetic uniformity

Genetic drift is the name given to this loss of variation It can affect evolution in surprisingly big ways but only when populations are quite small What small means would depend on the organism 50 individuals is small 5000 is not 500 is maybe The basic mechanism of drift is that genetic variety is reduced by chance making the individuals more similar to each other and hence more vulnerable

A Duster can be

A feather duster is a tool used for cleaning It consists typically of a handle and a segment composed of natural or artificial feathers which form the cleaning contact surface It is particularly useful for removing dust from surfaces

Feather dusters use the principles of static electricity to take up small debris such as broken wikt linkdanderdander

Electrostatics is the branch of physics that deals with apparently stationary electric charges 

This means for instance the attraction of plastic wrap to ones hand when one has removed it from a package but also apparently spontaneous explosion of grain silos and damage of electronic components during manufacturing or the operation of photocopiers 

Electrostatics involves the buildup of charge on the surface of objects due to contact with other surfaces Although charge exchange happens whenever any two surfaces contact and separate the effects of charge exchange are usually only noticed when at least one of the surfaces has a high resistance to electrical flow This is because the charges that transfer to or from the highly resistive surface are more or less trapped there for a long enough time for their effects to be observed These charges then remain on the object until they either bleed off to ground or are quickly neutralized by a discharge eg the familiar phenomenon of a static shock is caused by the neutralization of charge built up in the body from contact with nonconductive surfaces

The coat of arms of the Dominican Republic as described by Article 96 of the Dominican Constitution has a shield supported by an olive branch and a palm leaf above the shield a blue ribbon displays the national motto Dios Patria Libertad Below the shield there is a red ribbon with the words Repblica Dominicana

In the center of the shield there is an opened Bible with a small cross above it and on each side flanked by three spears two of them holding Dominican flags The Constitution does not specify in what page should be opened the Bible only that is the Book of Gospels opened In fact only the 1916 Constitution said opened in John Chapter XIII but that constitution was not valid because of the occupation of the country by United States

The National Flag of Dominican Republic has a small coat of arms in the center of the white cross

The first Dominican coat of arms was created by the first Dominican Constitution of 6 November 1844 but it was frequently changed until 1913 sometimes two different coats of arms were used at the same time

Mercenaries are soldiers who fight mainly for money rather than for their country or for their political beliefs

For many years in the Middle Ages soldiers from Switzerland fought battles for which ever side paid them The popes would hire soldiers from Switzerland to fight for them The Swiss Guard is all that is left of Switzerlands mercenary tradition However the modern Swiss Guard are not mercenaries because the guards are all catholic and are prepared to fight not for their country but for their beliefs

In anatomy the atlas is the top cervical vertebra of the spine In anatomy the atlas is written for short

It is named for the Atlas of mythology because it supports the head in the same way as Atlas held the world on his shoulders 

The atlas connects to a vertebra called the Axis Together they form the joint connecting the skull to the rest of the spine The atlas and axis are different in shape from all the other vertebrae They have more movement They allow the head to nod and to rotate

Vertebrae are the individual irregular bones that make up the spinal column a flexuous and flexible column There are normally thirty three vertebrae in humans including the five that are fused to form the sacrum and the four coccygeal bones which form the tailbone The upper three regions comprise the remaining 24 and are grouped under the names cervical thoracic and lumbar according to the regions they occupy

The 1928 Winter Olympics officially known as the II Olympic Winter Games were celebrated in 1928 in St Moritz Switzerland The 1928 Games were the first true Winter Olympics held on its own and not as a part of a Summer Olympics The preceding 1924 Winter Olympics were later renamed as Winter Olympics They were actually part of the 1924 Summer Olympics All preceding Winter Events of the Olympic Games were the winter sports part of the schedule of the Summer Games and not as a separate Winter Games

For the purposes of local government England is divided into as many as four levels of administrative divisions At some levels various legislation has created alternative types of administrative division

At the top level England is divided into nine regions Each one containing one or more county level areas The regions were created in 1994 and since the 1999 Euro elections have been used as Englands European Parliament constituencies All have the same status However London is the only region with any devolved power in the form of an elected mayor and the Greater London Authority The regions also vary greatly in their areas and their populations

England is divided by the Lieutenancies Act 1997 into areas for the appointment of Lord Lieutenants who are historically the Crowns representative in a county Although not actually defined as such these areas have become known as ceremonial counties These counties are sometimes used by people when describing where they live in England However many are not used as local government areas themselves as many are too large or include large urban areas They are taken into consideration though when drawing up Parliamentary constituency boundaries for example

For administrative purposes England is divided into four types of county level subnational entities used for local governance

There are six metropolitan counties divided into metropolitan boroughs which cover large urban areas outside London They were created in 1974 In 1986 their county councils were abolished

The shire counties were also created in 1974 and are legally known as non metropolitan counties They are divided into non metropolitan districts and cover much of the country though mainly the rural areas

Unitary authorities were created in the 1990s and are single tier authorities which combine the functions of county and district councils They are defined either as counties consisting of a single district or districts of a county such as Berkshire that has no county council The Isle of Wight is the exception being a county council with no districts 

Greater London was created in 1965 and is sometimes considered as a metropolitan county but it is not defined as such It is divided into the City of London and London boroughs

Districts in England may also have the status of borough city or royal borough

The metropolitan counties were divided into metropolitan districts which are usually called boroughs When the county councils were abolished the metropolitan districts gained much of their powers and therefore function similar to other unitary authorities

Shire counties are divided into non metropolitan districts Power is shared with the county council but shared differently to the metropolitan counties when first created

The civil parish is the most local unit of government in England Under the legislation that created Greater London they are not permitted within its boundary Not all of the rest of England is parished though the number of parishes and total area parished is growing

The following are exceptions to the general arrangements for local government in England and as a consequence are separately listed in legislation from the above types of local authorities where functions are allocated to particular groups of local authorities

In Greater London the 32 London borough councils have a status close to that of unitary authorities but there is also a higher strategic tier the Greater London Authority which oversees some of the functions performed elsewhere by Counties including transport policing the fire brigade and also economic development

As well as the same general functions performed by the surrounding London boroughs the City of London has others which make it distinct from most local authorities including extraterritorial possessions and services elsewhere in Greater London

Inner Temple and Middle Temple are small liberties within the boundary of the City of London which function as their own local authorities

The Isles of Scilly have a sui generis local authority the Isles of Scilly Council which is similar to a unitary authority found in the rest of England

A referendum was held in North East England on November 4 2004 to see whether people there wished to have an elected regional assembly As part of the referendum voters were to have been asked to choose which system of unitary authorities they would like to see in the existing county council areas if the regional assembly was approved In the event the vote in the North East was a decisive no making the proposed local government changes moot 

Similar referendums in North West England and Yorkshire and the Humber were postponed indefinitely on 8 November 2004 the Deputy Prime Minister announced I will not therefore be bringing forward orders for referendums in either the North West or Yorkshire and the Humber Statement by Deputy Prime Minister

Most of the proposed changes would have required no change in the county level entites as they could have been be implemented by merging districts and abolition of the county council Where borders were crossed however changes would have been needed This impacted Lancashire where various parts were proposed for combination with Blackpool and Blackburn with Darwen Sefton Wigan and southern Cumbria it also affects one proposal for North Yorkshire which would have merged the district of Selby with the East Riding of Yorkshire Few of the boundary changes would have involved creating new borders  only the proposals to combine Blackpool with parts of Wyre and to split West Lancashire between Wigan and Sefton would do this

Realism is a word that can be used in many different ways It is used mainly in the arts to describe the way that writers musicians painters etc thought in the late 19th century These artists were trying to show the world as it really is instead of trying to escape to a world of fantasy which is what the Romantics had been doing The Realists wanted to give an accurate description of Nature and of the way people lived in society

Realism in literature was a movement which started in Germany The poet and writer Heinrich Heine tried in his books to accept the world as it is instead of trying to escape from it Realistic writers tried to find good things about society

The interest in Realism led to a movement called Naturalism This meant describing scenes in nature accurately The novelist Emile Zola was a Naturalist

In philosophy Realism has a somewhat different meaning Realist philosophy is a way of thinking about the world in which things have an existence even if no one is studying them This was different from older philosophers who said that things only exist because of people who are aware of them For example beauty only exists because someone sees something that they think is beautiful A realist philosopher might say that beauty is there whether anyone sees it or not

In music there was a movement called Verismo which was the Italian word for reality Verismo was popular in Italian opera around the end of the 19th century and early 20th century Puccini was an opera composer whose style is typical of Verismo

In the early 20th century Realism led to other movements such as Dadaism and Surrealism

The effects of PCP can be very unpredictable It can affect the central nervous system by causing it to create states of euphoria loss of inhibitions anxiety disorientation restlessness drowsiness or disorganized thinking Other effects can also be distorted time space and body sensations feelings of weightlessness paranoia and the feeling of being disassociated with the environment Audial and visual hallucinations are common as well when using Angel Dust The drug raises the heart rate and blood pressure in your body External effects include but are not limited to excess salivation sweating numbness staggering slurred speech fever and muscle rigidity

The pilot fish is a fish that lives in many places of the world It lives in warm water It is a carnivore 

Pilot fish usually gather around sharks They eat parasites on their host as well as small pieces of food that their host does not eat When pilot fish are young they gather around jellyfish and drifting seaweeds

Pilot fish follow sharks because other animals which might eat the pilot fish will not come near a shark In return sharks do not eat pilot fish because pilot fish eat the parasites which feed off sharks This is called a mutualist relationship Small pilot fish are often seen swimming into the mouth of a sharks to eat small pieces of food from the sharks teeth Sailors even said that sharks and pilot fish act like close friends When a ship would capture the shark the pilot fish followed some people reported that the pilot fish would appear upset and follow the ship for up to six weeks 

They will follow ships in other circumstances sometimes for very long distances many pilot fish have been seen on the shores of England which is a long way from where they usually live

The pilot fish is of a dark blue to blackish silver colour and are slightly lighter in colour underneath They have between 5 and 7 dark stripes going from top to bottom When the fish is excited these stripes disappear and three large blue patches appear on its back The pilot fish is usually about 30 cm long but sometimes they can be as big as 70cm

The pilot fish will not hurt people and they are said to be good to eat They are very difficult to catch though

There are many explanations for the name pilot fish It could be because sailors people believed that pilot fish were leading them back to port or even leading swimmers and whales to safety It could also be because people used to think pilot fish would lead sharks to food

Floyd Landis is an American cyclist now best remembered because of the Tour de France 2006 doping scandal He is a time trial specialist and a strong climber

Landis turned professional in 1999 with the Mercury Cycling Team He joined the US Postal Service team in 2002 and moved to the Phonak Hearing Systems team in 2005

Landis was fired from the Phonak team on 5 August 2006 The doping test after stage 17 of the 2006 Tour de France showed he had a very high testosteroneepitestosterone ratio The rules say that for every one unit of one chemical he should have four unites of the other Landiss test showed a ratio of 111

Landis appealed to the USA Cycling and saying the tests were not done properly USA Cycling asked three people from the United States Anti Doping Agency to study Landiss claims On 20 September 2007 that group voted 2 to 1 against him Landis was stripped of his title as winner of the 2006 Tour de France by the UCI and banned from professional racing for two years 

Under UCI rules the cyclists national federation in this case USA Cycling decides if the rules have been broken but because of the science involved they asked the United States Anti Doping Agency to help

Floyd Landis was born in Farmersville Lancaster County  Pennsylvania 

Landis was brought up a Mennonite and rode his first races wearing sweatpants because his religion forbade wearing shorts he won anyway  Landis father is a devout Mennonite and tried to stop him from racing his bike by giving him extra chores He had no time to train during the day so he would sneak out of the house at night to train sometimes at 1 or 2 am and often in the freezing cold His father found that Floyd had been going out at night and often followed him at a distance to make sure he was not getting into trouble Today Floyd Landiss father is a supporter of his son and says he is one of Floyds biggest fans 

Before the 2006 Tour de Francemost people thought the winner would be either Ivan Basso or Jan Ullrich who finished second and third respectively in the 2005 tour Days before the race the Operacin Puerto doping case forced Basso and Ullrich to withdraw and Landis became one of the favourites to win

Landis performance up to Stage 16 of the Tour de France and his comeback in Stage 17 is surprising because of his hip ailment called osteonecrosis which was revealed in an article in The New York Times during the 2006 Tour de France This means he was in constant pain

Doping investigation

On July 27 2006 the Phonak Cycling Team said Floyd Landis had a urine test come back positive having an unusually high ratio of the hormone testosterone to the hormone epitestosterone after Stage 17 Landis denied having doped Phonak stated that he would be dismissed should the backup sample also test positive It did and Landis was suspended from professional cycling and dismissed from his team Landiss personal physician later disclosed that the test had found a TE ratio of 111 in Landis far above the maximum allowable ratio of 41 

The tests were done by French governments anti doping clinical laboratory the National Laboratory for Doping Detectionwhich is part of the Ministry of Youth Sport and Social Life and is and is accredited by the World Anti Doping Agency 

On May 14 2007 a meeting began between the USADA and Landis about the doping allegations On September 20 2007 the arbitrators found Landis guilty of doping 

As Landis forfeited his Tour title the second place rider scar Pereiro became the races official winner Landis has also been banned from the sport for two years dated retroactively to January 2007 

Landiss former team Phonak has already been disbanded

The USADA had more B samples taken during the Tour de France 2006 examined After Landiss attempts to prevent these tests had failed traces of exogenous testosterone were found in several samples in a test of seven samples These confirmation tests were done at the same French lab Landiss team was trying to discredit for the first positive results

Landis did race in France in 2007 so that the appeal could be decided in the United States first If the raced in France they may start their own investigation because doping is illegal in France

Among Landiss lawyers are Jos Maria Buxeda of Spain and Howard L Jacobs of the United States Buxeda represented Spanish cyclist Roberto Heras when he was suspended for two years after testing positive for doping Jacobs has also defended athletes accused of doping such as cyclist Tyler Hamilton and sprinter Tim Montgomery They are also representing Kazakh cyclist Alexandre Vinokourov who was accused of blood doping kicked out of the 2007 Tour de France and fired from his cycling team

On September 20 2007 Landis was found guilty of doping by a 2 1 vote of the hearing committee The committee said that there were mistakes testing the sample so they will not say that there was a high amount of the natural chemical testosterone But the committee did say was proof of artificial testosterone and that quotean Anti Doping Rule Violation is found to have been established

Landis does have the right to appeal the decision of the committee to the Court of Arbitration for Sport 

The Hawksbill Sea Turtle is an endangered species of turtle It is mostly seen in shallow lagoons and coral reefs where the sea sponges it eats live It is smaller than the Australian flatback turtle it is usually a little more than two feet long It usually weighs about 150 pounds It has the most pointed beak among sea turtles which is how it gets its name The hawksbill gets food from inside coral reefs eating sponges shrimp squid and other invertebrates The hawksbill pointy beak helps the turtle get food out of the tiny cracks and holes in which it searches

Though they are sometimes seen in American waters hawksbill turtles almost always nest in the warmer broken wikt linkclimateclimates that run along the equator Because people use the shell to make jewelry and other things the hawksbill turtle is endangered
